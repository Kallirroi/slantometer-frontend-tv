PAIN OF WHAT HAPPENED TODAY EASY

NOTHING MORE HURTFUL OR TRAGIC

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THAN THE LOSS OF INNOCENCE, BUT

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
NO MORE SO WHEN THOSE LOST ARE

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'M HEARTBROKEN.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

PEOPLE'S SPOUSES.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THOSE TEACHERS AND

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
ADMINISTRATORS WERE TAKEN FROM

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000

THEY WERE THERE FOR THOSE

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
CHILDREN, WHICH IS WHAT TEACHERS

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ARE ALL ABOUT.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000

IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA EARLIER TODAY.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
OBVIOUSLY, SO MANY QUESTIONS

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THAT ARE EMERGING AFTER WHAT

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
HAPPENED TODAY.
A VIRTUAL MASSACRE OF LITTLE,

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TINNY CHILDREN, AND THE WEAPONS

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THAT WERE USED, NOTHING SHORT OF

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TERRIFYING.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI FOLLOWING THIS

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000

THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS FOUND IN

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
DIFFERENT PLACES, VERY DANGEROUS

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WEAPONS.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> TWO WEAPONS FOUND ON THE

CLASSROOM, WHERE HE WAS FOUND

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
DEAD.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ONE OF THEM IS A GLOCK, AND THE

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OTHER IS A SIG SAUER, BOTH

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HANDGUNS, A THIRD WEAPON FOUND

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
IN A CAR, A VEHICLE, MAY HAVE

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BEEN HIS, OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>> IS THAT THE SCHOOL BEEN

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
PARKED SO ERRATICALLY, ROPED OFF

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WITH THE CRIME TAPE?

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
>> EXACTLY.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
CLOSELY EXAMINING THAT CAR.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THE THIRD WEAPON A SEMI

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AUTOMATIC KNOWN AS A

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
BUSHMASTER .223.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
ALL OF THE WEAPONS BELONGED TO

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
HIS MOTHER.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A MOTHER, SCHOOL TEACHER AT THE

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AS

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WELL.
TRYING TO PIECE ALL OF THIS

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
TOGETHER, WHY DID THEY HAVE

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THOSE GUNS.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
HOW DID HE GET THEM?

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> JUST ONE AREA I KNOW WILL BE

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A HUGE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION FOR

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
DAYS AND MONTHS TO COME.

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ANOTHER BIG QUESTION FOR SO

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
MANY.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE NAMES OF THESE CHILDREN.

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000

NANCY, THE MOTHER WHO DIED IN

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WHEN WILL BE FIND OW THE OTHE O

>> TOMORROW MORNING.

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THEY EXPECT TO RELEASE THE

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
IDENTITIES.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
DILIGENTLY TO CHECK, DOUBLE

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
CHECK, AND TRIPLE CHECK THEY

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT EVERYONE, MEMBERS OF THE

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000

MORNING.

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
>> SO SAD TO SEE BY EXCLUSION

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THEY HAVE MADE THE IDENTITIES

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OBVIOUS BY THOSE WHO WERE NOT

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
REUNITED WITH THE CHILDREN.

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
CHILDREN'S BODIES STILL LAY.

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, THANK YOU,

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

193
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> YOU BET.

194
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> AND DREW GRIFFIN WORKING ON

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AS MUCH INFORMATION WE CAN FIND

196
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ON THE SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA.

197
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT?

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
>> ACTUALLY, THIS IS PLAYING OUT

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IN ALMOST A SICKENING ROUTINE.

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A POSSIBLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE,

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THE FAMILY TRYING TO DEAL WITH

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE MENTAL HEALTHISH EAUS.

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SOMETHING SNAPS, GUNS EASILY

204
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ACCESSIBLE AND THE SHOOTING

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HAPPENS.

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER HAD AN

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
OLDER BROTHER.

209
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THAT BROTHER REPORTEDLY TOLD ABC

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
NEWS THAT THE SHOOTER, HIS

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
BROTHER, HAD A PERSONALITY

212
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
DISORDER.

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HE ALSO MENTIONED HIS BROTHER

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
HAD AUTISM OR WAS AUTISTIC.

215
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
CNN HEARD THAT SAME INFORMATION

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
FROM A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF A

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
FRIEND IN NEWTOWN WHERE THE

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SHOOTER LIVED.

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ALREADY, WE'RE SEEING A KIND OF

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BASE FOR SOME MENTAL HEALTH

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
QUESTIONS BEING RAISED,

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ASHLEIGH.
>> DREW, JUST QUICKLY.

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WHAT ABOUT WARNING SIGNS.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT WARNING

225
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SIGNS?

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
>> NOT YET.

227
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I FULLY EXPECT WE WILL SEE THAT

228
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AND MORE DETAIL ON THAT.

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
RIGHT NOW, ALSO SOMEWHAT

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
STANDARD IN THESE CASES, ASHLEY,

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
YOU WILL FIND PEOPLE SHOCKED

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THAT THIS PARTICULAR PERSON

233
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
LISTEN TO WHAT WE HEARD IN THERE

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A FORMER CLASSMATE AND SCHOOL

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
BUS DRIVER WHO KNEW THE

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
20-YEAR-OLD.
>> HE WAS JUST A KID.

239
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
>> JUST A KID?

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> JUST A KID.

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> NEVER ANTI SOCIAL?

242
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> NO.
ADAM HAS GOT A -- NO.

243
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> TROUBLE MAKER?

244
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> NOTICEABLE?
JUST KIND OF BLEND INTO THE

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
BACKGROUND?

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> YEAH.

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
OF THIS.

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
>> THEY ARE SAYING HE WENT AFTER

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
HIS MOM AND HER CLASS OF KIDS.

252
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
CAN YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THAT?
>> NO, I CANNOT.

254
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD DO

255
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
>> SO YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
WHAT?

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> THIS IS -- THIS IS

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
UNSPEAKABLE.
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT --

260
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I NEED TO GO.

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> A NICE KID.

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
VERY POLITELY.
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS, TO

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ME.
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK.

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

267
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT HE DID.

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HAPPENED, THAT HE SNAPPED, WHAT

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HAVE YOU, AND TOOK SUCH INNOCENT

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
LIVES.
>> ASHLEIGH, I'M CONVINCED IN

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THE COMING DAYS, MAYBE EVEN

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
TOMORROW, WE'LL BEGIN HEARING

274
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS, THAT

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THERE WERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THERE WAS A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T

277
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE SITUATION

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
OR WHERE TO TURN, WE HAVE SEEN

279
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
IT AT THE SHOOTING AT VIRGINIA

280
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
TECH, GABY GIFFORDS, AURORA,

281
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
COLORADO, MOVIE THEATER.

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'M SURE WE'LL SEE THAT.

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
WHAT WE WILL NOT SEE, REALLY,

284
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
FOR THE FAMILIES, IS ANY KIND OF

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
EXPLANATION THAT WILL MAKE SENSE

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
OF THIS.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S

287
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SENSELESS.
>> AND JUST SO UNBEARABLY

288
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
DIFFICULT TO DID I JUGEST, ESPE

289
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HERE ON THE SCENE.

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
WITHOUT QUESTION, SOMETHING MUST

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY WRONG.

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
ONE NAME YOU WILL LIKELY BE

294
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
HEARING MORE OF, HER NAME IS

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
KAITLIN ROIG.

296
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SHE IS BEING HAILED AS A HERO.

297
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
SHE SPOKE WITH DIANE SAWYER ON

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" EARLIER.

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
HAVE A LISTEN.

300
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> IN MY MIND, I'M THINKING, AS

301
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A 6-YEAR-OLD, 7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
AND I'M THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

304
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
ALMOST BE THEIR PARENT.

305
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
LIKE I HAVE TO TELL THEM, SO I

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SAID TO THEM, I SAID I NEED YOU

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU ALL VERY

308
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
MUCH.
AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

309
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
LAST TIME THEY WERE EVER GOING

311
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TO HEAR.

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

313
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
DIE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, TEACHERS AND, YOU

315
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
KNOW, I WANTED THEM TO KNOW

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
SOMEONE LOVED THEM AND I WANTED

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THAT TO BE ONE OF THE LAST

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
THINGS THEY HEARD, NOT THE

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
GUNFIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
IT IS JUST SO HORRIBLE.

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SO HORRIBLE.

322
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL STORY.

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'M JOINED BY THE HASKINS

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
FAMILY, BOB AND HIS CHILDREN,

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
JULIA AND BOBBY.

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
BOB, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
FRIEND OF YOURS WHO IS A

328
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
BASKETBALL COACH HERE IN TOWN,

329
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WHO HAS TWO CHILDREN ATTENDING

330
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
SANDY HOOK.
ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN WAS A

331
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
FIRST GRADER WHO WITNESSED

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY

333
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
UNBELIEVABLE.

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I WANT YOU TO RECOUNT FOR ME THE

335
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
STORY IF YOU WILL.

336
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
JUST SPOKE TO HIM AN HOUR OR SO

337
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
AGO.
HIS YOUNG SON WAS IN CLASS, AND

338
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THE SHOOTER BROKE INTO THE

339
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
CLASSROOM, FRONT OF HIS EYES

340
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
GUNNED DOWN THE TEACHER, HE WAS

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
ASTUTE TO TAKE A COUPLE OF

342
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
STUDENTS AND RAN OUT THE DOOR

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
BEHIND THE BACK OF THE SHOOTER

344
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
AND RAN OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND

345
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CONTINUED TO RUN FOR ABOUT A

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HALF A MILE UNTIL HE HIT THE

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
MAIN ROAD.

348
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A STRANGER PICKED UP THE KIDS

349
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
AND TOOK THEM TO THE NEWTOWN

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

351
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
UNBEKNOWNST TO THE PARENTS, WHEN

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THEY WENT TO TALK TO THE STATE

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
TROOPERS AND PARENTS, HER SON

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WAS UNACCOUNTED FOR.

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
GO DOOR TO DOOR, LOOK IN THE

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WOODS, AND FOR AN HOUR OR SO,

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE THEIR SON

358
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
WAS.

359
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THEY CALLED THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT A COUPLE OF TIMES,

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
HAD NO RECORD OF HIM BEING THERE

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
AND FINALLY AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR

362
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
AND A HALF, THEY CALLED AND

363
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
RELIEVED TO FIND OUT, INDEED,

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THEIR SON HAD BEEN DROPPED OFF

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAFE

366
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND SOUND.

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
>> BUT AT THAT TIME, THEY MUST

368
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
HAVE THOUGHT THE WORST.

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
>> THEY THOUGHT THE WORST.

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
IT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TIME

371
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
FOR THEM.

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST HOUR

373
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
AND A HALF HE'S EVER EXPERIENCED

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
IN HIS LIFE.

375
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
>> POLICE INTERVIEWED THIS FIRST

376
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
GRADER.
I'M GUESSING HE'S 6, 7 YEARS

377
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
OLD.

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
>> 6 YEARS OLD.

379
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THEY INTERVIEWED HIM SINCE HE

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
WAS THERE.

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
>> WHAT DID HE TELL THEM, WHAT

382
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
KIND OF DETAIL?

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
>> THE INTERVIEW, VERY

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
ELEMENTARY.

385
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THEY ASKED WHAT HE SAW.

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
DESCRIBED THE SHOOTER, HIS FACE,

387
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
EXPRESSION.
THEY ASKED WHAT WAS HIS

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
RECOLLECTION OF THE ROOM.

389
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
HE SAID I SAW A WHOLE BUNCH OF

390
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
SILVER BULLETS ON THE FLOOR OF

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THE CLASSROOM, WHEN I GOT INTO

392
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THE HALL, I SAW A WHOLE BUNCH OF

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
BULLETS ON THE FLOOR, AND THIS

394
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WEREN'T SILVER, THEY WERE RED,

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
UNFORTUNATELY, COVERED WITH
BLOOD IN THE HALLWAY.

396
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
AND AT THAT POINT, HE RAN,

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SPRINTED OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

398
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
>> DID HE GIVE A DESCRIPTION ANY

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
FURTHER ABOUT THE SHOOTER, THE

400
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
FACE, DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

401
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> HE DESCRIBED WHAT HE LOOKED

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
LIKE.
BUT IT'S A VERY ELEMENTARY CITY

404
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
DESCRIPTION BECAUSE HE'S 6 YEARS

405
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
OLD.
>> JULIA, YOU ARE -- HAVE YOU A

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
DIFFERENT STORY.
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL HERE

407
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
IN TOWN.

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
YOU WENT INTO LOCKDOWN RIGHT

409
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
AWAY AS SOON AS THIS HAPPENED.

410
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
>> YES.

411
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
>> DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

412
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
HAPPENING?
EVERYBODY HAS CELL PHONES AND

413
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEXT MESSAGES,

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON?

415
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
>> NO CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
UNTIL THE FIRST HOUR.

417
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ONE OF THE MY TEACHERS SAID

418
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
THERE WAS A SHOOTING A MILE DOWN

419
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THE ROAD.

420
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>> DO YOU HAVE A CLASSMATE WHO

421
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HAD A LITTLE BROTHER AT THE

422
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
SCHOOL?
>> YES.

423
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
THE BOY WHO I WAS SITTING RIGHT

424
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
NEXT TO DURING THE LOCKDOWN, HIS

425
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
LITTLE BROTHER ENDED UP DYING.

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
>> HOW DID HE FIND THAT OUT?

427
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

428
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM YET

429
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
TODAY, DURING THE LOCKDOWN, HE

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

431
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD A

432
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
LITTLE BROTHER AT SANDY HOOK

433
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
SCHOOL UNTIL I JUST FOUND OUT

434
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
HIS BROTHER HAD DIED.

435
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
>> HE HADN'T BEEN CONCERNED AT

436
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THE TIME ABOUT FINDING OUT THE

437
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
FATE OF HIS LITTLE BROTHER WHILE

438
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
HE WAS IN LOCKDOWN IN YOUR

439
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
CLASSROOM?

440
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT, NO.

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
>> BOBBY, YOU WERE IN ANOTHER

442
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
SCHOOL AS WELL.

443
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
HAND THIS OFF TO YOU.

444
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
YOU WERE IN ANOTHER SCHOOL, YOU

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WENT INTO LOCKDOWN.

446
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE FOR YOU?

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
WE WERE IN CHURCH AT THE TIME.

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
FRIDAY SCHOOL MASS AND MONSIGNOR

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
WISE CAME IN, WE NEED TO END

451
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
MASS DOWN AND GO TO IMMEDIATE

452
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
LOCKDOWN.
WHAT HAPPENED, THE TEACHERS WENT

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
AROUND, LOCKED ALL THE DOORS AND

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WE SAT IN THE PEWS AND JUST

455
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WAITED AND WE COULD HEAR SIRENS

456
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

457
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> DID YOU LIKE YOUR SISTER

458
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
EVENTUALLY FIND OUT WHAT WAS

459
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
GOING ON?

460
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> YEAH, WE -- EVENTUALLY WENT

461
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
BACK TO THE SCHOOL, AND THEN MY

462
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CLASS WAS LOCKED DOWN IN THE

463
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
BASEMENT, AND OUR TEACHERS TOLD

464
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
US THAT THERE HAD BEEN A

465
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
SHOOTING AND THERE WERE

466
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
FATALITIES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT UNTIL MY

468
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
DAD PICKED ME UP EARLY FROM

469
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SCHOOL, AND ON THE CAR RIDE

470
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
HOME, HE TOLD ME THERE ARE QUITE

471
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A FEW FATALITIES?

472
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

473
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> WE WENT TO THE VIGIL TONIGHT

474
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
AT 7:00.
IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.

475
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> YOU ARE AWFULLY YOUNG TO

476
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
DIGEST THIS.
NONE OF US ARE HANDLING THIS

477
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
WELL.

478
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
>> IT DIDN'T REALLY SINK IN.

479
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I WAS NUMB UP UNTIL -- UNTIL THE

480
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
VIGIL AND I THINK I KIND OF

481
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
BROKE DOWN AT THE VIGIL, BECAUSE

482
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
IT WAS SO SAD TO SEE EVERYONE

483
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THERE AND SEE -- THEY HAD

484
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
ACTUALLY 28 CANDLES ON THE ALTAR

485
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
TO REPRESENT THE VICTIMS.

486
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> AT THE VIGIL.
AND PASS THE MIKE TO YOUR DAD.

487
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
BOB, AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT AT THE

488
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
VIGIL, THERE WAS A LETTER THAT

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
WAS READ FROM THE POPE.

490
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
>> THERE WAS A LETTER THAT WAS

491
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
WROTE -- THAT WAS WRITTEN BY

492
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
POPE BENEDICT TO OUR COMMUNITY

493
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SPECIFICALLY, WHICH WAS VERY

494
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
TOUCHING.
AND VERY MEANINGFUL.

495
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
IT MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO THE

496
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WHOLE COMMUNITY, AND ON TOP OF

497
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THAT, WHAT WAS REALLY EMOTIONAL

498
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
FOR US, MONSIGNOR WISE, A

499
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WONDERFUL PASTOR OF OUR CHURCH

500
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
TALKED ABOUT IN HIS HOMILY, THE

501
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
TIME HE SPENT WITH THE 20

502
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
FAMILIES TODAY, AND IN

503
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
PARTICULAR HE MENTIONED TWO

504
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
LITTLE ANGELS BEING ONE OF WHOM

505
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
THE MOTHER OF THE VICTIM SAID

506
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
SHE WENT OUT RECENTLY AND GOT

507
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
HER FIRST COMMUNE DRESS, AND THE

508
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
DAUGHTER WAS VERY, VERY EXCITED

509
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
ABOUT THAT.
AND THE OTHER LITTLE ANGEL WAS

510
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
GOING TO PLAY AN ANGEL IN OUR

511
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SCHOOL PLAY AT ST. ROSE NEXT

512
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WEEK.
A VERY POIGNANT STORY AND VERY,

513
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
VERY EMOTIONAL FOR US TO HEAR

514
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AND DIGEST.
>> HOW IS YOUR FRIEND?

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THE BASKETBALL COACH WHOSE CHILD

516
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
WENT THROUGH THIS HARROWING

517
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
ORDEAL, HOW IS HE DOING?

518
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
>> I THINK BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE

519
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
IT, TRAUMATIZED.

520
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
A WONDERFUL MAN, WONDERFUL

521

ALTHOUGH HE'S INCREDIBLY

523
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
GRATEFUL, YOU KNOW, THAT HIS SON

524
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
IS SAFE, HIS HEART IS CERTAINLY

525
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
BLEEDING FOR THE OTHER CHILDREN

526
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
IN THE CLASSROOM, BECAUSE TWO OF

527
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HIS SON'S CLASSMATES DID PERISH

528
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IN THAT SAGA THAT I TOLD YOU,

529
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WHEN THE GUNMAN CAME IN.

530

TWO OF THE LITTLE BOYS

531
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
CLASSMATE'S WERE KILLED TODAY.

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
>> HE WITNESSED HIS OWN TEACHER

534
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
BEING SHOT.

MOST PEOPLE KNEW SOMEONE.

IF IT WASN'T A PARENT IT WAS A

599
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
CHILD.
IF IT WASN'T A CHILD, IT WAS A

600
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TEACHER.

601
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
IF IT WASN'T A TEACHER, IT WAS

ROSE OF LIMA, IN THE AFTERMATH

614

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000

COMMUNITY IS GOING TO COPE WITH

669
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
FROM THIS POINT ON.

670
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
FOR DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, AND

671
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
CERTAINLY FOR THE PARENTS OF

672
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000

GET BUZZED IN AT 9:30 IN THE

680
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
MORNING, AND YET THIS WAS

681
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
PERPETRATED AGAINST HER SCHOOL.

682
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
JASON CARROLL, REPORTING LIVE

683
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
JUST ACROSS TOWN FROM WHERE I

684
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
AM.
PART OF THE REASON I AM WHERE I

685
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
AM, IS THAT THE MEDIA IS GETTING

686
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
REGULAR UPDATES AT THIS

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
LOCATION, NOT ONLY FROM THE

CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR DAN

MALLOY, WHO HAS COME AT REGULAR

INTERVALS TO BRIEF US, BUT ALSO

692
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SPOKEN WITH THE FAMILIES WHO

693
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
WERE GIVEN THE ULTIMATE TERRIBLE

694
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
NEWS THEY WOULD NOT BE REUNITING

695
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

696
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
HE MADE ANOTHER STOP AT THE

697
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
VIGIL JASON REPORTED ON.

698
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

699
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
MONSIGNOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

700
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
FOR OPENING THIS VERY BEAUTIFUL

701
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
CHURCH SO THAT WE MIGHT IN A

702
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
COMMUNAL WAY FIND SOLACE AND ONE

703
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ANOTHER AS A RESULT OF THE

704
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
UNSPEAKABLE HAVING OCCURRED IN

705
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

706
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, BROTHERS,

707
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
SISTERS, WERE TAKEN FROM THEM.

708
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
PEOPLE'S SPOUSES.

709
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THOSE TEACHERS AND

710
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
ADMINISTRATORS, WERE TAKEN FROM

711
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
US.

712
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
YET WE STAND IN A CHURCH AND

713
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
MANY OF US TODAY, IN THE COMING

714
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
DAYS, WILL RELY UPON THAT WHICH

715
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT AND THAT

716
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
WHICH WE INHERENTLY BELIEVE THAT

717
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
THERE IS FAITH FOR A REASON AND

718
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THAT FAITH ITSELF IS GOD'S GIFT

719
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
TO ALL OF YOU.

720
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
AND IN THESE TIMES OF TROUBLES

721
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
AND TRAVAILS, WHEN THE

722
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS IN OUR VERY

723
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
MIDST, OUR FAITH IS TESTED.

724
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
NOT JUST IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE,

725
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
NOT JUST NECESSARILY OUR FAITH

726
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
IN GOD, BUT OUR FAITH IN

727
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
COMMUNITY, IN WHO WE ARE, IN

728
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY OFFER.

729
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
AND IN SO MANY WAYS, PERMISSIBLE

730
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
TO HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS AND THOSE

731
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
DOUBTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE

732
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
ARE, WHAT COMMUNITY REPRESENTS,

733
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
BUT THEN WE TURN TO UNDERSTAND

734
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
AS WE TURN AROUND THIS ROOM AND

735
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
RECOGNIZE OUR FRIENDS AND OUR

736
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
NEIGHBORS.

737
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000

IN THE COMING DAYS AS MANY OF US

PREPARE TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH

760
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000

>> I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU

781
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
ONE OF THE MORE POIGNANT STORIES

782
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THAT I LEARNED TODAY FROM A

783
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
NURSE NAMED MAUREEN.

784
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
SHE WANTED TO VOLUNTEER.

785
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WHEN SHE HEARD WHAT WAS GOING ON

786
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
AT THE SCHOOL, SHE AND ANOTHER

787
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
NURSE RACED TO THE SCHOOL TO

788
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
HELP AND FOUND THEMSELVES

789
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
SURPRISED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING

790
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
FOR THEM TO DO.

791
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
SADLY, THEY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND

792
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THAT THERE WERE NO MORE

793
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
SURVIVORS COMING OUT OF THE

794
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
SCHOOL.

795
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FIRE

796
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
STATION, A STAGING AREA FOR

797
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
PATIENTS TO BE REUNITED WITH

798
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THEIR KIDS, AND, OF COURSE, IT

799
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
WAS A STAGING AREA WHERE A LOT

800
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
OF PARENTS WOULDN'T BE REUNITED

801
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN EITHER.

802
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THE SAD STORY THAT SHE TOLD ME

803
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WAS THE MOMENT THAT,

804
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THE AUTHORITIES

805
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
HAD TO TELL THESE PARENTS THAT

806
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THERE WERE NO MORE SURVIVORS.

807
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
ANOTHER WITNESS, WHO WAS IN THE

808
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
AREA SAID THAT THE CRIES AND THE

809
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
WAILS WERE OVERWHELMING, THAT IT

810
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WAS ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT

811
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THINGS TO HAVE TO UNDERGO.

812
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
TWO PRIESTS WHO WERE ON THE

813
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
SCENE AS WELL, AT LEAST TWO

814
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
GRIEF COUNSELOR THERE TO TRY TO

815
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
HANDLE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

816
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WITH THESE APPROXIMATELY 50

817
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
PEOPLE.
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, 20 KIDS, AND

818
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
THEY ALL HAVE PARENTS, SO

819
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
ROUGHLY 50 PEOPLE HAD TO ENDURE

820
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THAT TERRIBLE MOMENT, WHEN THEY

821
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
WERE TOLD THEY WOULD LIKELY

822
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
NEVER SEE THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN.

823
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
COMING UP, A WOMAN WHO WORKS AT

824
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
A DAYCARE HERE IN TOWN TELLS US

825
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THAT MANY OF HER DAYCARE

826
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
STUDENTS HAD GRADUATED TO BECOME

827
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
STUDENTS AT SANDY HOOK

828
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ELEMENTARY.

829
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
SHE'LL TALK TO US IN A MOMENT.

830
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
ME...

831
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
thinking my only option was the
vial and syringe dad used.

832
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And ME...

833
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
discovering once-daily
Levemir® FlexPen.

834
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
FlexPen® is prefilled.

835
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Doesn't need
refrigeration

836
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
for up to
42 days.

837
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
No drawing from a vial.

838
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Dial the exact dose.

839
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Inject by pushing a button.

840
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
FlexPen® is insulin delivery...

841
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
MY way.

842
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is a long-acting insulin

843
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children

844
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
with diabetes and is not
recommended to treat

845
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
diabetic ketoacidosis.

846
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Do not use Levemir® if
you are allergic

847
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to any of its ingredients.

848
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

849
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
which may cause
symptoms such as sweating,

850
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
shakiness, confusion,
and headache.

851
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Severe low blood sugar can be
serious and life threatening.

852
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Ask your healthcare provider
about alcohol use,

853
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
operating machinery, or driving.

854
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Other possible side
effects include

855
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
injection site reactions.

856
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Tell your healthcare provider
about all medicines you take

857
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and all of your
medical conditions.

858
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Get medical help right away
if you experience

859
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
serious allergic
reactions, such as body rash,

860
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
trouble with breathing, fast
heartbeat, or sweating.

861
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
With FlexPen®... say good night
to vial and syringe.

862
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
HE SAID I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY

922
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WITH NOW.

923
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
BUT -- EXCUSE ME.

924

>> THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME

925
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
IS DEAD.

926
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
AS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO THE

927
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
PERPETRATOR LIVED WITH.

928
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000

RYAN LANZA NOT CHARGES WITH

931
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ANYTHING TODAY.

932
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
AT THIS POINT HE IS BEING

933
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
QUESTIONED.

934
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> THERE IS A RELATED SCENE THAT

935
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WE DISCOVERED AS WE CONTINUED

936
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
OUR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

937
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
>> I ASK GOD OUR FORTHER TO

938
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
CONSOLE THOSE WHO MOURN AND

939
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
SUSTAIN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY

940
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WITH THE STRENGTH WHICH TRIUMPHS

941
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
OVER VIOLENCE WITH THE POWER OF

942
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
FORGIVENESS, HOPE, AND

943
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
RECONCILING LOVE.

20 YOUNG CHILDREN LOTT LOST

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THELOST

949
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEIR LIVES, AGES 5 TO 10.

950
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THE REST OF THE CLASSMATES WERE

951
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ROBBED OF INNOCENCE AFTER

952
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
WITNESSING THIS TRAGEDY, THESE

953
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
PARENTS WILL FOREVER BE

954
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
MOURNING.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU

955
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
MICHELLE BABCO.

956
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
SHE USED TO WORK AT A DAYCARE

957
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
AND WATCHED MANY OF THE CHILDREN

958
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THAT WERE IN THE ELEMENTARY

959
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
SCHOOL AT THE TIME OF THE

960
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SHOOTING.

961
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE

962
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SHOOTING?
>> EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON, I

963
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
CONTACTED A FAMILY AND ASKED IF

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THE GIRLS WERE OKAY.

965
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
THEY WERE HOME SAFE AND SOUND,

966
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
BUT TO PRAY FOR THE ONES THAT

967
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
WERE VERY FORTUNAUNFORTUNATE.

968
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF ANY OF THE

969
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
KIDS WHO ATTENDED YOUR DAYCARE

970
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
WERE VICTIMS OF THE RAMPAGE?

971
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
>> ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW HOME

972
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
SAFE AND SOUND WITH THEIR

973
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
FAMILIES.
>> IT MUST BE AN ENORMOUS

974
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
RELIEF?
>> IT WAS.

975
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
TO HEAR ALL OF THE KIDS I HAVE

976
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
KEPT IN TOUCH WITH ALL THESE

977
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
YEARS WERE HOME, YES.
>> DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK

978
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
TO THEIR PARENTS OR FIND OUT HOW

979
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THEY ARE DOING?
>> I DID.

980
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I SAID THEY ARE VERY FORTUNATE,

981
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
HOME, AND, YOU KNOW, TO PRAY FOR

982
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THE ONES THAT WERE NOT SO

983
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
FORTUNATE IN THE SHOOTING

984
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
EARLIER TODAY.
AND VERY, VERY HAPPY THAT THEIR

985
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
LITTLE ONES ARE HOME SAFE AND

986
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
SOUND.
>> YOU WORK AT THE DAYCARE, THE

987
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
LITTLE EXPLORERS DAYCARE.

988
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> YES.

989
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> ARE YOU CLOSED?

990
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP

991
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WORKING ON MONDAY?

992
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
IS ANYTHING CHANGING IN TERMS OF

993
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
YOUR SECURITY MEASURES?

994
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU AS YOU

995
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
GO FORWARD, LOOKING AFTER YOUR

996
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
LITTLE ONES?

997
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> I WORKED THERE SEVERAL YEARS

998
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
AGO, BUT IT IS UP AND RUNNING AS

999
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OF TODAY.

1000
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> IT IS RUNNING?

1001
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
>> IT IS.

1002
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> YOU ALSO HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS

1003
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

1004
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
>> YES.

1005
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS INJURED

1006
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
EARLIER TODAY AND LAST TIME I

1007
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
SPOKE TO THE FAMILY THAT KEEPS

1008
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
IN TOUCH WITH HER, SHE WAS STILL
IN THE HOSPITAL.

1009
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
>> HOW WAS SHE INJURED?

1010
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT.

1011
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF SHE WAS IN

1012
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THAT MEETING WHEREBY THE

1013
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

1014
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
PSYCHOLOGIST WERE SHOT DEAD?

1015
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THREE OF

1016
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
THESE TEACHERS IN THE MEETING

1017
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HAD EMERGED INTO THE HALLWAY

1018
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
WHEN THE GUNSHOTS RANG OUT AND

1019
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
ONLY ONE CAME BACK AND WAS

1020
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
INJURED IN THE FOOT OR THE LEG

1021
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
AND I'M TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER

1022
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WHETHER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOUR

1023
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
FRIEND?

1024
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SAME

1025
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
PERSON, I'M UNCERTAIN OF THAT.

1026
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I KNOW SHE WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT.

1027
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
>> HOW ARE YOU PROCESSING THIS?

1028
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
>> IT'S HARD TO HANEL THIS, I

1029
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
HAD ALL OF THESE KIDS SINCE THEY

1030
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WERE THREE.

1031
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE

1032
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
FAMILIES AND JUST VERY THANKFUL

1033
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THAT THEY ARE HOME ON THIS

1034
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
HOLIDAY WITH THEIR PARENTS, BUT

1035
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
STILL PRAYING FOR THE ONES THAT

1036
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
WERE INJURED.
>> AND NEWTOWN, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL

1037
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
AND QUIET COMMUNITY.

1038
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
EVERYONE WHO GOES THROUGH A

1039
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
TRAGEDY SAYS IT WOULD NEVER

1040
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
OCCUR THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN

1041
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THERE.
AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T OCCUR

1042
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN HERE.

1043
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
>> IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

1044
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
IT'S SMALL, QUAINT, AND QUIET,

1045
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT DID

1046
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
HAPPEN.
>> YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS GOING

1047
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
TO BE OKAY?

1048
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
>> YES, HOME WITH MY PARENTS.

1049
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
WE'LL BE OKAY.

1050
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
>> THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH

1051
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
US.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU AS WELL.

1052
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
>> THANK YOU.

1053
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1054
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY

1055
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
COLLEAGUES, DREW GRIFFIN.

1056
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
A NUMBER OF WEAPONS THAT WERE

1057
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
RECOVERED AT THE SCHOOL.

1058
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ALL OF THEM.

1059
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
ALL THREE OWNED BY THE SHOOTER'S

1060
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
MOTHER.

1061
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
REGISTERED.
CONNECTICUT HAS SOME OF THE

1062
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
TOUGHEST GUN LAWS ON THE BOOKS

1063
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
IN THIS NATION.

1064
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
NOW THERE ARE CALLS FOR EVEN

1065
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
STRENG

1066
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
STRICTER GUN CONTROL.
AND DREW GRIFFIN HAS THAT PART

1067
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OF THE STORY AS WELL.

1068
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU, WE KNOW THESE

1069
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
GUNS WERE LEGALLY OWNED BECAUSE

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
OF CONNECTICUT'S VERY STRICT GUN
CONTROL LAWS.

1071
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE,

1072
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
ASHLEIGH.
THE TWO HANDGUNS IN THE STATE OF

1073
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
CONNECTICUT REQUIRE A

1074
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
CERTIFICATE OF POSSESSION.

1075
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
A FIVE-YEAR LICENSE TO OBTAIN

1076
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AND OWN THAT WEAPON.

1077
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
IT COMES WITH THE REQUIREMENT

1078
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YOU GO THROUGH A TRAINING

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
COURSE.
A HANDGUN SAFETY COURSE.

1080
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
AS FOR THAT ASSAULT RIFLE, IF

1081
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THAT IS INDEED AN OPERATING SEMI

1082
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ASSAULT RIFLE.
THAT GUN IS BANNED IN

1083
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
CONNECTICUT, HOWEVER, IF THE GUN

1084
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WAS PURCHASED AND IN THE

1085
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
POSSESSION OF THE MOTHER PRIOR

1086
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
TO OCTOBER OF 1993.

1087
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
THAT GUN WOULD HAVE BEEN GRAND

1088
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
FATHERED IN TO HER POSSESSION.

1089
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

1090
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
REGISTERED TO HER WITH THE STATE

1091
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
AS WELL.

1092
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
VERY STRICT GUN LAWS IN THE

1093
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

1094
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
YES, THESE GUNS WERE ALL LEGALLY

1095
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
OWNED.
>> AND, DREW, THE SHOOTER IN

1096
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THIS CASE, ADAM LANZA, HE HAD NO

1097
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
CRIMINAL RECORD, NO ONE CAN FIND

1098
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
ANYTHING THAT HE HAS DONE WRONG.

1099
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
WOULD THAT HAVE FACTORED INTO

1100
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE GREATER

1101
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
ACCESS TO CERTAIN GUNS IN THE

1102
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
STATE?
>> BEING 20 YEARS OLD, NO WAY HE

1103
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
COULD HAVE PURCHASED A HANDGUN

1104
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
LEGALLY, CERTIFICATE OR NOT.

1105
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

1106
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
HE COULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THAT

1107
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
ASSAULT RIFLE BECAUSE IT'S

1108
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
BANNED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE

1109
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
GRANDFATHER CLAUSE.

1110
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
LEGALLY SPEAKING, HE COULD NOT

1111
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
HAVE OWNED THESE GUNS.

1112
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
WE'LL TURN TO THE FACT THAT THEY

1113
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
WERE IN THE MOTHER'S HOME.

1114
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
OBVIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE AND HOW

1115
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
WERE THEY STORED, DID THE MOM

1116
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
KNOW HE HE WAS USING THE GUNS,

1117
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
TRAINING THE GUNS?

1118
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
WE'LL LOOK AT THOSE TYPES OF

1119
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ISSUES.
AS FOR CONNECTICUT GUN LAWS,

1120
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
ASHLEIGH, TO SAY THAT THE KID

1121
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
COULD HAVE GONE OUT AND BOUGHT

1122
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
THESE GUNS?

1123
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THE ANSWER IS, LEGALLY, NO.

1124
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
>> A GLOCK AND SIG SAUER FOUND

1125
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
ON HIS PERSON IN THE SCHOOL

1126
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AFTER HE APPARENTLY KILLED

1127
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HIMSELF AND THEN A BUSHMAST

1128
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
BUSHMASTER .223 FOUND IN THE

1129
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
VEHICLE THAT HE HAD APPARENTLY

1130
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
LEFT ERRATICALLY PARKED OUT IN

1131
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.

1132
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
DREW GRIFFIN, THANK YOU FOR

1133
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
LOOKING INTO THAT.

1134
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
DREW GRIFFIN REPORTING LIVE.

1135
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL, NOT A

1136
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
LARGE SCHOOL, SOMEWHAT SPREAD

1137
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
OUT.

1138
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
SANDY HOOK HAS A SQUARE

1139
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
FORMATION, AND THE SHOOTER TOOK

1140
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
A CERTAIN PATH THROUGH THE

1141
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
SCHOOL.
BUT AS THEY SAID, THE OFFICIALS

1142
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SAID, HE WASN'T RUNNING THROUGH

1143
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THE HALLS AND SHOOTING.

1144
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
HE WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHERE

1145
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
HE TARGETED.

1146
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
HAVE A LOOK AT HOW TOM FOREMAN

1147
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
LAYS THIS OUT FOR US.

1148
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
>> 9:30, A NORMAL START TO THE

1149
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
DAY.

1150
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
APPROXIMATELY 600 STUDENTS IN

1151
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
CLASS, 50 FACULTY MEMBERS.

1152
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE READ ON

1153
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THE LAYOUT OF THE SCHOOL OR THE

1154
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
TIMELINE, WE'LL TRY AND PIECE

1155
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
TOGETHER ALL DAY LONG AS

1156
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE.

1157
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
SOME IDEA.

1158
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
DAY GETTING UNDERWAY, A MEETING

1159
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
HAPPENING UP HERE INVOLVING THE

1160
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
PRINCIPAL, VICE PRINCIPAL, A

1161
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND SEVERAL

1162
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
OTHER ADULTS IN THIS AREA, THEN

1163
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AROUND 9:40, BEST WE CAN TELL

1164
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
FROM WITNESSES, JUST TEN MINUTES

1165
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
LATER, THE GUNMAN ENTERS THE

1166
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
BUILD.
HOW DID HE DO IT?

1167
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
THE NEW SECURITY SYSTEM, NOT

1168
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SURE HOW HE GOT PAST THAT OR IF

1169
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
IT WAS LOCKED UP AT THAT POINT.

1170
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
POLICE LOOKED VERY HARD AT A CAR

1171
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
PARKED IN THE FIRE LANE.

1172
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
STILL THERE SURROUNDED BY TAPE

1173
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
AS BEST I CAN TELL.

1174
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
SUGGESTED WOULD BE THAT SOMEHOW

1175
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
THE GUNMAN CAME RIGHT THROUGH

1176
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
THE FRONT DOOR, INTO THE SCHOOL.

1177
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THIS

1178
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
BUILDING REPORTED AND ONE FIRE.

1179
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
9:41, THAT'S WHEN THE CALLS

1180
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
STARTED COMING IN TO 911.

1181
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THE VICE

1182
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
PRINCIP

1183
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
PRINCIPAL, AND THE SCHOOL

1184
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
PSYCHOLOGIST, ACCORDING TO

1185
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
WITNESSES, WENT OUT TO THE HALL

1186
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
AND TOWARD THE GUN IF FIRE TO

1187
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

1188
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
SHOUTING, MANY SHOUTINGS AND

1189
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SHOTS.

1190
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
HE CAME BACK INTO THE MEETING

1191
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
ROOM WOUNDED.
ALL OF THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN

1192
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF

1193
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
TIME AND THE GUNMAN DID NOT ROAM

1194
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AROUND, BUT GENERALLY STAYED IN

1195
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
JUST TWO ROOMS AND A HALLWAY

1196
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
RIGHT UP

1197
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
IN HERE, THAT'S, IN FACT, WHERE

1198
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
THEY ULTIMATELY FOUND HIM.

1199
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
9:45, TEACHERS TRYING TO PROTECT

1200
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
STUDENTS ALL THROUGHOUT THE

1201
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
SCHOOL.

1202
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SOME AROUND THE GYM MASS YUM

1203
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WERE TOLD TO HIDE IN CLOSE ELTS.

1204
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
OTHERS LED OUTSIDE TO FLEE.

1205
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
NOT REALLY CLEAR IF THAT

1206
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
HAPPENED WITH TEACHERS OR LATER

1207
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
HELPED OUT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

1208
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
OFFICIALS.

1209
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
WE KNOW THERE WAS A REAL EFFORT

1210
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL TO GET THE

1211
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
KIDS TO SOME SORT OF SAFETY.

1212
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
THIS PICTURE FROM THE NEWTOWN

1213
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
BEE.

1214
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
AND ALL OF THE TEACHERS TRY TO

1215
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

1216
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

1217
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
ON.
IT'S UNCLEAR, AT WHAT POINT IN

1218
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THIS PROCESS THE GUNMAN DIED.

1219
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THEY FOUND HIMSELF DEAD IN ONE

1220
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
OF THE THE ROOMS THERE.

1221
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
THE SUGGESTION?

1222
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
PROBABLY HE KILLED HIMSELF.

1223
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
MORE DETAILS AS WE GO ON.

1224
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
WE KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

1225
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AGENTS ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL,

1226
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
THEY SET UP A PERIMETER OF STATE

1227
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
AND LOCAL POLICE.

1228
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THEY ENTERED IMMEDIATELY TO

1229
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SECURE ROOMS TO FIND STUDENTS

1230
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
AND MAKE SURE IF A GUNMAN WAS

1231
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
STILL ACTIVE, THEY GOT HIM UNDER

1232
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
CONTROL.

1233
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THEN THEY QUICKLY STARTED

1234
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
LEADING STUDENTS AWAY FROM THE

1235
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
SCHOOL, TRYING TO GET THEM OUT

1236
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
OF SAFETY.

1237
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A HORRENDOUS EVENT.
VERY DIFFICULT EVEN FOR THE

1238
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
OFFICERS INVOLVED.
THEY HAD TO TELL MANY OF THE

1239
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
CHILDREN, AVERT YOUR EYES, CLOSE

1240
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
YOUR EYES.

1241
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THEY KNEW THEY WOULD LEAD THEM

1242
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
RIGHT PAST MANY OF THE VICTIMS.

1243
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
>> OH, TOM.

1244
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
SUCH A DIFFICULT DETAIL TO

1245
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
LISTEN TO, THAT THE CHILDREN HAD

1246
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
TO AVERT THEIR EYES AS THEY

1247
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
ESCAPED THE SCHOOL.
YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT

1248
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1249
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
STATES SHEDS A TEAR IN PUBLIC,

1250
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
AND TODAY IT HAPPENED.

1251
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT'S

1252
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
MOVING TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS,

1253
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
AFTER THE BREAK.

1254
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
>>> THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I

1255
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERYONE

1256
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
PARENT IN AMERICA WILL DO.

1257
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
WHICH IS HUG OUR CHILDREN A

1258
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
LITTLE TIGHTER AND TELL THEM

1259
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
THAT WE LOVE THEM, AND WE'LL

1260
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
REMIND EACH OTHER HOW DEEPLY WE

1261
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1262
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1263
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
CONNECTICUT THAT CANNOT DO THAT

1264
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
TONIGHT.
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

1265
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
NOW.
AND OUR DAYS TO COME, THAT

1266
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS TO US BE AT OUR

1267
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

1268
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

1269
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

1270
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
ALLY BANK.

1271
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WHY THEY HAVE A
RAISE YOUR RATE CD.

1272
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
TONIGHT OUR GUEST,
THOMAS SARGENT.

1273
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
NOBEL LAUREATE
IN ECONOMICS,

1274
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
AND ONE OF THE MOST CITED
ECONOMISTS IN THE WORLD.

1275
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
PROFESSOR SARGENT,
CAN YOU TELL ME

1276
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
WHAT CD RATES WILL
BE IN TWO YEARS?

1277
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
NO.

1278
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
IF HE CAN'T, NO ONE CAN.

1279
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
THAT'S WHY ALLY HAS
A RAISE YOUR RATE CD.

1280
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000

1281
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
YOUR MONEY NEEDS AN ALLY.

1282
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
>>> FOR MUCH OF THE DAY, SO MUCH

1283
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
CONFUSION ABOUT WHO THE SHOOTER

1284
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WHO PERPETRATED THIS TERRIBLE

1285
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
ACT HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1286
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
CONNECTICUT, WAS.

1287
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
THERE WAS CONFUSION, BECAUSE HE

1288
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
WAS USING I.D. THAT DIDN'T

1289
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
BELONG TO HIM.

1290
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
IT BELONGED TO HIS BROTHER.

1291
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
A BROTHER WHO IS IN HOBOKEN,

1292
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
CONNECTICUT.
AND THAT CONFUSION LED POLICE

1296
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000

PRESENCE HERE.

1321
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
THE FBI DID REMOVE MATERIALS

1322
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
FROM THIS APARTMENT, INCLUDING

1323
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
SOME KIND OF COMPUTER.

1324
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY

1325
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THE BROTHER WAS TAKEN INTO

1326
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000

ONE POLICE OFFICER ON THE SCENE

1329

DID TELL ME, APPARENTLY SOME

1330
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
KIND OF CONFUSION THAT THE

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
BROTHER'S I.D. MAY HAVE BEEN

1332
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
FOUND ON THE SHOOTER'S BODY.

1333
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THAT WAS ONE POLICE OFFICER

1334
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
TELLING ME THAT, WE'RE NOT

1335
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000

AND THE LANZA'S FATHER ALSO

1346
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
QUESTION.
THEY AREN'T SUSPECTS, BUT THEY

1347
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY

1348
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
QUESTIONED.
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A

1349
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
PRESIDENT IN TEARS, BUT IT

1350
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
WASN'T BUT A FEW HOURS THIS NEWS

1351
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
HIT THE PRESIDENT'S DESK PRETTY

1352
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
QUICKLY.

1353
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
HE TOOK TO THE AIR WAIVES TO

1354
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
OFFER COMFORT AND SUPPORT TO THE

1355
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS IN

1356
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1357
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
HERE IS THE ADDRESS HE MADE

1358
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
TODAY.

1359
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH

1360
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
DANE

1361
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
DAN MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

1362
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ROBERT MUELLER.

1363
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL HAVE

1364
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
EVERY RESOURCE HE NEEDS TO

1365
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
INVESTIGATE THE HEINOUS CRIME,

1366
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
CARE FOR THE VICTIMS, COUNCIL

1367
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THEIR FAMILIES.
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1368
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

1369
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
YEARS.

1370
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
EACH TIME I HEAR THE NEWS, I

1371
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT, BUT AS

1372
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD, AS A PARENT

1373
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

1374
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
TODAY.

1375
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

1376
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1377
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

1378
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
DO.
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1379
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1380
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

1381
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1382
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1383
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1384
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

1385
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1386
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

1387
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

1388
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

1389
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

1390
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

1391
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

1392
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1393
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

1394
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST, OUR

1395
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1396
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

1397
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
WELL.

1398
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

1399
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1400
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

1401
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1402
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

1403
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

1404
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

1405
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

1406
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

1407
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

1408
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

1409
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
MALL IN OREGON, OR A TEMPLE IN

1410
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THREATER

1411
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
IN AURORA, OR A STREET CORNER IN

1412
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

1413
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

1414
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

1415
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

1416
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

1417
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

1418
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
LIKE THIS REGARDLESS OF THE

1419
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
POLITICS.

1420
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

1421
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

1422
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO, HUG OUR

1423
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER.

1424
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

1425
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THEM.

1426
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

1427
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1428
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1429
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

1430
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
TONIGHT, AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

1431
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
RIGHT NOW.

1432
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
AND IN OUR DAYS TO COME, THAT

1433
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

1434
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
BEST ASAMERICANS AND I WILL DO

1435
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

1436
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

1437
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

1438
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THE SPACE OF THE LOST CHILD OR

1439
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

1440
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
A HAND TO THOSE IN NEED TO

1441
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

1442
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

1443
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

1444
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST

1445
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
ENDURINGS NOT JUST IN THEIR

1446
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
MEMORIES, BUT ALSO IN OURS.

1447
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORIES OF

1448
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
THE VICTIMS.

1449
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
AND IN THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

1450
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED AND BIND

1451
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
UP THEIR WOUNDS.

1452
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
>> WE ARE INDEED A NATION IN

1453
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
MOURNING TONIGHT AND IT IS KNOWN

1454
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
ACROSS THE WORLD WHAT HAPPENED
IN AMERICA, IN NEWTOWN,

1455
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
CONNECTICUT.
THERE HAS BEEN REACTION FROM

1456
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
WORLD LEADERS WHO HAVE WRITTEN,

1457
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
WHO HAVE MADE STATEMENTS ABOUT

1458
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
THIS TRAGEDY, AND THEN THERE IS

1459
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
THE REACTION FROM PEOPLE, PEOPLE

1460
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD,

1461
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
WHO NOW HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA TO LET

1462
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
US KNOW, TO LET THEIR FRIENDS

1463
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
KNOW, TO LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT

1464
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

1465
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
JOSH LEVIN WITH ALL OF THE

1466
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
REACTION ON TWITTER.

1467
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
>> PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE

1468
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
EXPRESSING THEIR HORROR AND

1469
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
SORROW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

1470
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
THIS IS PART OF THE STORY.

1471
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
THE GLOBAL ACTION.

1472
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
THIS AREA WHERE YOU SEE THAT IS

1473
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
ON SOCIAL MEDIA ESPECIALLY.

1474
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
SOME OF THE TWEETS GETTING A LOT

1475
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
OF ATTENTION, ONE FROM MAYOR

1476
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
MIKE BLOOMBERG IN NEW YORK.

1477
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES WITH

1478
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
FAMILIES ARE AFFECTED AND MY

1479
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
DETERMINATION TO STOP THIS MAD

1480
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
SCIENCE STRONGER THAN EVER.

1481
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
LET'S JUMP ACROSS THE POND TO

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
DAVID CAMERON.
PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN.

1483
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THOSE WHO

1484
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE

1485
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTINGS.

1486
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THE DEATH OF SO MANY CHILDREN IS

1487
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
TRULY HEARTBREAKING.

1488
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
NOW, THIS ONE IS VERY

1489
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
INTERESTING.

1490
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
DEEPAK CHOPRA SAYS HE'S

1491
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000

1493
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE THAT HAVE

1494
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
BEEN KILLED.

1495
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.

1496
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
PLATFORMS.

THE REAL TRAGEDY, WE KEEP

1500
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
LETTING THIS KIND OF THING

1501
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER

1502
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000

IS A VERY LARGE PROJECT THAT

1518
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
LIES AHEAD FOR THE

1519
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
INVESTIGATORS, FOR THE POLICE,

1520
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
FOR THE RESPONDERS HERE.

1521
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
THIS WAS SUCH A MASSIVE CRIME

1522
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
SCENE THAT THE PROCESSING OF IT

1523
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
ALONE IS GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST
