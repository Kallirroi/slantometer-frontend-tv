WOMEN YOU CALLED INTO SERVICE

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WHEN THEY WERE JUST CHILDREN.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THEY WANTED TO BE POLICE

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
CARE FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN

LIFE TO SERVE.

251
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
YOU ASKED THEM TO PAY A HIGH

YOU EQUIPPED THEM.

THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAME

268

WHEN THE NEED WAS GIVEN.

269
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000

THIS IS A SACRED TEXT FROM THE

293

BAHA'I FAITH.

294
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
IT WAS WRITTEN AS A LETTER TO A

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
MOTHER WHO WAS MOURNING THE LOSS

296
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000

EVENING.

299
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
ALTHOUGH THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
INDEED HEARTBREAKING AND BEYOND

301
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THE LIMITS OF HUMAN ENDURANCE,

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
YET ONE WHO KNOWETH AND

303

UNDERSTANDETH IS ASSURED THAT

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000

306
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WORLD INTO ANOTHER, AND YOU WILL

FIND THEM IN THE DEVINE REALM.

THAT REUNION SHALL BE FOR

309

ETERNITY, WHILE IN THIS WORLD,

310
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SEPARATION IS INEVITABLE AND

OH, THOU KIND MOTHER AND FATHER,

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THANK DEVINE PROVIDENCE THAT I

IS SPACIOUS, ILLUMINED AND EVER

334
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
JOYOUS AND JUBILANT.

335
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THEREFORE, LAMENT NOT, OH,

336
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
MOTHER AND FATHER, AND BE NOT

GRIEVED.
I AM NOT OF THE LOST, NOR HAVE I

BEEN OBLITERATED AND DESTROYED.

339
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I HAVE SHAKEN OFF THE MORTAL

342
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
FOLLOWING THIS SEPARATION IS

343
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
EVERLASTING COMPANIONSHIP.

THE COUNSELORS AND THE CLERGY

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
AND ALL THE CAREGIVERS AMONG US.

358
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THEY HAVE GREAT PASSION FOR WHAT

359
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THEY DO AND WHEN EVERYONE DOES

360
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THEIR PASSION, WE ARRIVE AT

361
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
COMPASSION, AND WE THANK YOU.

362
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE MOST AWARE

363
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
OF THEIR NEEDS.

364
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THEY, TOO, BECOME TIRED AND

365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
SOMETIMES CLOSE TO BURNING OUT.

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
HOW MUCH WE NEED ONE ANOTHER.

367
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
WHEN YOU CALL JEREMIAH OR AMOS

368
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OR BARUK AND ALL YOUR PRECIOUS

369
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
APOSTLES AND PROPHETS, THEY

370
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
HEDGED AT FIRST.

371
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
BUT EACH TIME, IN TURN, THEY

372
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
GAVE THEIR YES AND THEY FOLLOWED

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
YOU.

374
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS

375
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
AMONG THEM, ALWAYS SUPPORTING

376
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THEM.

377
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
THEY WERE CONDUITS FOR YOUR EYES

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR VOICE AND

379
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
YOUR HANDS.

380
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THEY WERE THE CLAY KNOWING THAT

381
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
YOU ALWAYS WERE THE POTTER, AND

382
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THEY WERE REZSILIENT IN YOUR

383
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
HANDS.
WHEN JESUS FELT THE NEED TO GET

384
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
AWAY FOR SOME RESPITE HIMSELF,

385
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000

386
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
THE WILDERNESS OR OUT TO THE

387
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
SEASHORE, AND THE GREAT NUMBERS

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
OF PEOPLE IN NEED ALWAYS

389
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
FOLLOWED.

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
TIRED AND DRAINED AS HE WAS, HE

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
LOOKED ON THEM WITH COMPASSION.

392
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ANOINT ALL YOUR PEOPLE, LORD,

393
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
ALL THOSE WHO MINISTER TO YOU AS

394
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THEY MINISTER TO ONE ANOTHER AND

395
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
ESPECIALLY THIS WEEK AS THEY

396
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
MINISTER TO THE BODY, MIND, AND

397
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SPIRIT, TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

398
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
OF SANDY HOOK AND NEWTOWN.

399
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
A MODEL FOR THE NATION, A MODEL

400
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
FOR THE WORLD, AND WE THANK YOU

401
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000

USE THEM, LORD.

406
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
TAKE THE PASSION THAT EACH ONE

407
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HAS AND TRANSFORM IT TOTALLY,

408
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
COMPLETELY INTO YOUR SPIRIT OF

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
COMPASSION.

410
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
AND WE ASK THIS ALL, AMEN.

411
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
AMEN.

>> NEWTOWN IS A PLACE THAT LOVES

413
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
CHILDREN ABOVE ALL.

414
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
FAMILIES MOVE TO NEWTOWN BECAUSE

415
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WE ARE A CARING AND LOVING

416
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
COMMUNITY.
WE ARE ALSO A PLACE THAT HAS

417
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
GREAT PRIDE IN OUR SCHOOLS,

418
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
PRIDE THAT PROPELS THE STUDENTS

419
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
IN THOSE SCHOOLS WITH THEIR

420
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OUTSTANDING TEACHERS AND

WORTH.

424
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THE HORROR THAT WAS VISITED UPON

425
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
OUR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WAS NOT

426
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
DESERVED.

427
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
IT WAS AN ANGRY AND DESPERATE

428
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
ACT OF A CONFUSED YOUNG MAN.

429
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THERE'S NO BLAME TO BE LAID ON

430
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
US, BUT THERE IS A GREAT BURDEN

431
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
AND A GREAT CHALLENGE THAT THESE

432
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
FAMILIES DEVASTATED BY

433
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
UNSPEAKABLE HARM KNOW AND TRUST

434
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
THAT WE LOVE THEM AND WILL DO

435
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM

436
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
HEAL.

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I KNOW THAT NEWTOWN WILL

438
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
PREVAIL, THAT WE WILL NOT FALL

439
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

440
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
IT IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR OUR

441
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
TOWN, BUT IT DOES NOT DEFINE US.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WE ARE NEWTOWN, A SPECIAL AND

443
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000

FAMILIES.

449
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IT IS MY PLEASURE, LADIES AND

450
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
GENTLEMEN, TO PRESENT TO YOU

THANK YOU.

462
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
WHEN I CAME IN TO THE HALL, ONE

463
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
OF THE FIRST SONGS TO BE PLAYED

464
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
ON THE PIANO WAS "AMAZING

465
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
GRACE," WHICH IS FITTING FOR ANY

466
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
NUMBER OF REASONS.

467
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
IT'S BECOME AN ANTHEM FOR FIRST

468
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
RESPONDERS, IT HAS GREAT WORDS,

469
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
IT ALSO SPEAKS OF THE POWER OF

470
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
FAITH.
"AMAZING GRACE" WAS WRITTEN BY A

471
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
FORMER SEA CAPTAIN ENGAGED IN

472
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
THE SLAVE TRADE.

473
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
AND THOSE PROFOUND WORDS THAT "I

474
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW AM FOUND"

475
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
SPEAK TO US ON A DAY LIKE TODAY.

476
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
WHEN WE ARE CALLED UPON, DARE I

477
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
SAY REQUIRED TO BE INVESTED IN

478
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
OUR FAITH, A FAITH SO EVIDENT IN

479
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THIS ROOM AND IN THIS COMMUNITY

480
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
AT THIS TIME.

481
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
A FAITH THAT IS, AFTER ALL, AT

482
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
ITS VERY CORE, A GIFT FROM GOD.

483
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE FIND COMFORT

484
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
AND HOPE AND COMPASSION.

485
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE ARE GIVEN

486
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THE POWER TO GO ON.

487
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TO SURVIVE THAT WHICH HAS

488
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
BEFALLEN THIS COMMUNITY, THESE

489
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
FAMILIES, THESE SPOUSES, THAT

490
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
WHICH HAS HAPPENED AND IS

491
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
UNIMAGINABLE AND UNTHINKABLE AND

492
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
WAS NEVER, WE THOUGHT, INTENDED

493
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
TO BE VISITED UPON US HERE IN

494
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
CONNECTICUT OR IN NEWTOWN OR IN

495
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SANDY HOOK.

496
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I CHOOSE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT

497
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL

498
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
OFFICIALLY ENTER WINTER.

499
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
AND THAT IS ALWAYS TO BE

500
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
FOLLOWED BY THE SPRING.

501
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IN

502
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
WINTER, EACH TIME I SEE THE

503
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
BEGINNING OF A SNOWFALL, I WILL

504
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
BE THINKING OF THOSE 27 SOULS

505
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
LOST JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

506
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A LITTLE

507
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
LONGER, I WILL THINK AND DREAM

508
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
OF THE LIVES THAT MIGHT HAVE

509
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
BEEN AND THE LIVES THAT WERE SO

510
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
FULL OF GRACE.
AND WHEN THE FLOWERS START TO

511
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
COME OUT OF THE GROUND, AND WHEN

512
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THEY RISE UP, I WILL KNOW THAT

513
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THOSE THAT

514
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
WE HAVE LOST IN THE LAST FEW

515
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
DAYS.

516
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WE WILL GO ON.

517
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
WE WILL FIND STRENGTH.

518
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
FAITH IS A GIFT, AS IS OUR

519
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
ABILITY TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER

520
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000

WE WILL MOVE ON, WE WILL NEVER

528
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000

529
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000

GLORY THAT FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM

560
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
ALL, SO WE FIX OUR EYES NOT ON

561
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WHAT IS SEEN, BUT ON WHAT IS

562
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
UNSEEN.
SINCE WHAT IS SEEN IS TEMPORARY,

563
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
BUT WHAT IS UNSEEN IS ETERNAL.

564
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
FOR WE KNOW THAT IF THE EARTHLY

565
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
TENT WE LIVE IN IS DESTROYED, WE

566
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HAVE A BUILDING FROM GOD, AN

567
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
ETERNAL HOUSE IN HEAVEN NOT

568
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
BUILT BY HUMAN HANDS.

569
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WE GATHER HERE IN MEMORY OF 20

570
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND SIX

571
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

572
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

573
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
SCHOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY

574
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SCHOOL IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF

575
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE THAT

576
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
COULD BE ANY TOWN IN AMERICA.

577
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, I COME TO OFFER

578
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THE LOVE AND PRAYERS OF A

579
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
NATION.

580
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

581
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

582
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

583
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

584
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

585
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

586
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
YOUR GRIEF.

587
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

588
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
TORN APART.

589
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

590
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

591
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT,

592
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

593
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

594
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

595
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

596
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

597
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

598
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
BEAR IT.

599
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

600
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AS THESE DIFFICULT DAYS HAVE

601
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
UNFOLDED, YOU'VE ALSO INSPIRED

602
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
US.

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
WITH STORIES OF STRENGTH AND

604
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
RESOLVE AND SACRIFICE.

605
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
WE KNOW THAT WHEN DANGER ARRIVED

606
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
IN THE HALLS OF SANDY HOOK

607
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ELEMENTARY, THE SCHOOL'S STAFF

608
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DID NOT FLINCH.
THEY DID NOT HESITATE.

609
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG AND MARY

610
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
SHERLACH, VICKI SOTO, LAUREN

611
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
RUSSEAU, RACHEL DAVINO, AND ANN

612
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
MARIE MURPHY, THEY ALL RESPONDED

613
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
IN HOW WE HOPE WE ALL WOULD

614
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
RESPOND IN SUCH TERRIFYING

615
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH COURAGE AND

616
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WITH LOVE, GIVING THEIR LIVES TO

617
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

618
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
CARE.

619
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

620
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TEACHERS WHO BARRICADED

621
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THEMSELVES INSIDE CLASSROOMS AND

622
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
KEPT STEADY THROUGH IT ALL AND

623
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
REASSURED THEIR STUDENTS BY

624
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
SAYING WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS,

625
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
THEY ARE COMING.

626
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

627
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AND WE KNOW THAT GOOD GUYS CAME,

628
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO RACED

629
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TO THE SCENE HELPING TO GUIDE

630
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THOSE IN HARM'S WAY TO SAFETY

631
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
AND COMFORT THOSE IN NEED,

632
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
HOLDING AT BAY THEIR OWN SHOCK

633
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AND THEIR OWN TRAUMA, BECAUSE

634
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THEY HAD A JOB TO DO AND OTHERS

635
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
NEEDED THEM MORE.

636
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
AND THEN THERE WERE THE SCENES

637
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN HELPING

638
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
ONE ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

639
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

640
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

641
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
SOMETIMES DO.

642
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

643
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWNUP BY SAYING,

644
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
"I KNOW KARATE, SO IT'S OKAY,

645
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT."

646
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE INSPIRED

647
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
US, NEWTOWN.

648
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

649
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
VIOLENCE, IN THE FACE OF

650
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL, YOU'VE

651
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

652
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
YOU'VE CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER.

653
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
AND YOU'VE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.

654
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THIS IS HOW NEWTOWN WILL BE

655
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
REMEMBERED, AND WITH TIME AND

656
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
GOD'S GRACE, THAT LOVE WILL SEE

657
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
YOU THROUGH.

658
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BUT WE AS A NATION, WE ARE LEFT

659
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
WITH SOME HARD QUESTIONS.

660
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED THE JOY

661
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
AND ANXIETY OF PARENTHOOD AS THE

662
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
EQUIVALENT OF HAVING YOUR HEART

663
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY ALL THE

664
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
TI

665
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
TIME, WALKING AROUND.

666
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
WITH THEIR VERY FIRST CRY, THIS

667
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
MOST PRECIOUS, VITAL PART OF

668
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
OURSELVES, OUR CHILD.

669
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD

670
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THE POSSIBLE MISHAP OR MALICE,

671
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS THERE'S

672
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO TO SHIELD

673
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
OUR CHILDREN FROM HARM, AND YET

674
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THAT

675
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
CHILD'S VERY FIRST STEP AND EACH

676
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
STEP AFTER THAT, THEY ARE

677
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
SEPARATING FROM US.

678
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
THAT WE WON'T -- THAT WE CAN'T

679
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM.

680
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THEY WILL SUFFER SICKNESS AND

681
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
SETBACKS AND BROKEN HEARTS AND

682
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND WE LEARN

683
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
THAT OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS

684
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO

685
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
BECOME SELF RELIANT AND CAPABLE

686
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
AND RESILIENT, READY TO FACE THE

687
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
WORLD WITHOUT FEAR.

688
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS BY

689
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
OURSELVES.

690
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
IT COMES AS A SHOCK AT A CERTAIN

691
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
POINT WHERE YOU REALIZE NO

692
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THESE

693
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
KIDS, YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

694
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
YOURSELF.

695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
THAT THIS JOB OF KEEPING OUR

696
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
CHILDREN SAFE AND TEACHING THEM

697
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
WELL IS SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY DO

698
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
TOGETHER.

699
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS AND

700
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
NEIGHBORS, THE HELP OF A

701
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
COMMUNITY AND THE HELP OF A

702
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
NATION.

703
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
AND IN THAT WAY WE COME TO

704
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
REALIZE THAT WE BEAR

705
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY CHILD,

706
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
BECAUSE WE'RE COUNTING ON

707
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HELP LOOK

708
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
AFTER OURS.

709
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THAT WE'RE ALL PARENTS, THAT

710
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THEY ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN.

711
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK, CARING

712
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

713
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
OUR FIRST JOB.

714
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

715
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

716
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

717
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

718
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

719
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
TRULY SAY, AS A NATION, THAT

720
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS?

721
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

722
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

723
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE FROM

724
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
HARM?

725
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
CAN WE CLAIM, AS A NATION, THAT

726
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER THERE,

727
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
LETTING THEM KNOW THEY ARE LOVED

728
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
AND TEACHING THEM TO LOVE IN

729
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
RETURN?
CAN WE SAY THAT WE'RE TRULY

730
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
DOING ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL THE

731
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY THE

732
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE OUR

733
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THEIR LIVES IN HAPPINESS AND

734
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
WITH PURPOSE?

735
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS THE

736
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
LAST FEW DAYS, AND IF WE'RE

737
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

738
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
ANSWER'S NO.

739
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

740
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

741
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

742
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

743
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

744
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

745
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
SHOOTINGS.

746
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

747
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
SURVIVORS, THE FOURTH TIME WE'VE

748
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
CONSOLED THE FAMILYIES OF

749
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
VICTIMS, AND IN BETWEEN, THERE

750
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
HAVE BEEN AN ENDLESS SERIES OF

751
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE

752
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
COUNTRY, DAILY REPORTS OF

753
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,

754
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
IN SMALL TOWNS AND CITIES ALL

755
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
ACROSS AMERICA.

756
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
VICTIMS WHO MUCH OF THE TIME

757
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
THEIR ONLY FAULT WAS BEING AT

758
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

759
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
TIME.

760
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

761
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

762
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

763
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

764
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEXED,

765
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
AND THAT IS TRUE.

766
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

767
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

768
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

769
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY,

770
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

771
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
AN ACTION.

772
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

773
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
THIS.

774
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

775
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR

776
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER TOWN

777
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

778
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

779
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
AND NEWTOWN AND COMMUNITIES FROM

780
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
COLUMBINE TO BLACKSBURG BEFORE

781
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THAT, THEN SURELY WE HAVE AN

782
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
OBLIGATION TO TRY.

783
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

784
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

785
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS,

786
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

787
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

788
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
AND EDUCATORS, IN AN EFFORT

789
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

790
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, BECAUSE

791
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

792
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE THIS

793
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AS ROUTINE.

794
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

795
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

796
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

797
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD.

798
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

799
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

800
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

801
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

802
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
FREEDOM?

803
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
YOU KNOW, ALL THE WORLD'S

804
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
RELIGIONS, SO MANY OF THEM

805
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
REPRESENTED HERE TODAY, START

806
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION.
WHY ARE WE HERE?

807
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE MEANING?

808
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
WHAT GIVES OUR ACTS PURPOSE?

809
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
WE KNOW OUR TIME ON THIS EARTH

810
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
IS FLEETING.

811
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EACH HAVE

812
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
OUR SHARE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN,

813
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THAT EVEN AFTER WE CHASE AFTER

814
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
SOME EARTHLY GOAL, WHETHER IT'S

815
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WEALTH OR POWER OR FAME OR JUST

816
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
SIMPLE COMFORT, WE WILL, IN SOME

817
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
FASHION, FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE

818
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
HAD HOPED.

819
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
WE KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW GOOD

820
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
OUR INTENTIONS, WE'LL ALL

821
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
STUMBLE SOMETIMES IN SOME WAY.

822
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
WE'LL MAKE MISTAKES, WE'LL

823
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
EXPERIENCE HARDSHIPS, AND EVEN

824
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE

825
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
RIGHT THING, WE KNOW THAT MUCH

826
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
OF OUR TIME WILL BE SPENT

827
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
GROPING THROUGH THE DARKNESS, SO

828
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
OFTEN UNABLE TO DISCERN GOD'S

829
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
HEAVENLY PLANS.

830
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN BE

831
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SURE OF, AND THAT IS THE LOVE

832
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THAT WE HAVE.

833
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR

834
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
FAMILIES, FOR EACH OTHER.

835
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL CHILD'S

836
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
EMBRACE, THAT IS TRUE.
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

837
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

838
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

839
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
EYES, THAT FIERCE AND BOUNDLESS

840
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
LOVE WE FEEL FOR THEM, A LOVE

841
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
THAT TAKES US OUT OF OURSELVES

842
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
AND BINDS US TO SOMETHING

843
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
LARGER.
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

844
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING RIGHT

845
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

846
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM WELL.

847
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

848
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
KINDNESS.

849
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
WE DON'T GO WRONG WHEN WE DO

850
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
THAT.

851
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE SURE OF,

852
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU, THE PEOPLE

853
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
OF NEWTOWN, HAVE REMINDED US.

854
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THAT'S HOW YOU'VE INSPIRED US.

855
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
YOU REMIND US WHAT MATTERS.

856
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD DRIVE US

857
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
FORWARD IN EVERYTHING WE DO FOR

858
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
AS LONG AS GOD SEES FIT TO KEEP

859
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
US ON THIS EARTH.

860
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME TO

861
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ME, JESUS SAID, AND DO NOT

862
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
HINDER THEM, FOR TO SUCH BELONGS

FOR THOSE OF US WHO REMAIN, LET

872
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
US FIND THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ON

873
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY WORTHY OF

874

THEIR MEMORY.
MAY GOD BLESS AND KEEP THOSE

WE'VE LOST IN HIS HEAVENLY

>> ON BEHALF OF THE NEWTOWN

884
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
CLERGY ASSOCIATION, WE ARE SO

885
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
GRATEFUL TO OUR PRESIDENT FOR

886
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
SPENDING TIME WITH US AND FOR

887
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
REMINDING US THAT WE ARE NOT

888
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
ALONE IN THIS TIME OF TRAGEDY,

889
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THAT THERE'S NOT JUST A COUNTRY

890
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
STANDING BEHIND US, THAT THERE'S

891
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
A WORLD STANDING BEHIND US.

892
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THOSE WORDS I KNOW AS DIFFICULT

893
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
AS THEY WERE TO HEAR FOR SOME,

894
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
BROUGHT MUCH CONSOLATION TO ALL.

895
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I WANT TO THANK OUR GOVERNOR AND

896
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
ALL THE STATE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE

897
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
BEEN BY OUR SIDE SINCE DAY ONE.

898
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
THEY HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE

899
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
REMINDER TO US OF THEIR HUMANITY

900
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
AND THEIR CARE FOR US.

901
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
BUT MOST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK

902
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
AN INCREDIBLE FIRST-SELECT WOMAN

903
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
WHO'S LED US THROUGH THE MOST

904
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
DARK PERIODS OF OUR LIVES.

905
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
IN THE STORMS OF THE PAST YEARS

906
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT

907
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
POWER FOR DAYS, I THOUGHT THOSE

908
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
WERE THE HARDEST DAYS OF PAT'S

909
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
LIFE, BUT WHEN I SAW HER FRIDAY

910
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
IN FRONT OF SANDY HOOK SCHOOL, I

911
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
REALIZED THAT SHE'D MET THE MOST

912
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
DARK DAYS.

913
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
PAT, TO YOU, TO DR. ROBINSON, WE

914
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING LEADERS TO

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
US THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT

916
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
TIMES.
AND NOW THIS FINAL PART OF OUR

917
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
PRAYER IS FOR US, THE PEOPLE OF

918
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
NEWTOWN.

919
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
>> THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE

922
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY IN

923
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
RESPONSE TO THIS, IF GOD IS FOR

924
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?

925
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
HE WHO DID NOT SPARE HIS OWN

926
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000

00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
US, HOW WILL HE NOT ALSO ALONG

928
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
WITH HIM GRACIOUSLY GIVE US ALL

929
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
THINGS?

930
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
WHO WILL BRING ANY CHARGE

931
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AGAINST THOSE WHOM GOD HAS

932
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
CHOSEN, THAT IS GOD WHO

933
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
JUSTIFIES, WHO IS HE THAT

934
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
CONDEMNS?
CHRIST JESUS WHO DIED, MORE THAN

935
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
THAT WHO WAS RAISED TO LIFE, WAS

936
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD AND IS

937
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ALSO INTERCEDING FOR US.

938
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE

939
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
LOVE OF CHRIST, SHALL TROUBLE OR

940
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
HARDSHIP OR PERSECUTION OR

941
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
FAMINE OR NAKEDNESS OR DANGER OR

942
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
SWORD AS IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOUR

943
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
SAKE, WE FACE DEATH ALL DAY

944
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
LONG, WE ARE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP

945
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
TO BE SLAUGHTERED.

946
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
KNOW IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE

947
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
MORE THAN CONQUERERS THROUGH HIM

948
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
WHO LOVED US, FOR I AM CONVINCED

949
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
THAT NEITHER DEATH, NOR LIFE,

950
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
NEITHER ANGELS, NOR DEMONS,

951
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
NEITHER THE PRESENCE, NOR THE

952
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
FUTURE, NEITHER ANY POWERS,

953
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
HEIGHT, NOR DEPTH, IN ALL

954
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
CREATION WILL BE ABLE TO

955
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD

956
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS OUR
LORD.

957
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
>> AND SO WE STAND NOW IN PRAYER

958
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
FOR OURSELVES.

959
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN, BUT OUR

960
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
SPIRITS ARE STRENGTHENED BY THE

961
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
POWER OF GOD'S GOODNESS AND HIS

962
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
EVER-CREATING LOVE AND BY THE

963
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
GENEROUS HEARTS OF A COMMUNITY

964
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
WHO TRULY CARES.

965
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
WE HAVE SHOWN TO THE WORLD OUR

966
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
COMPASSION.
