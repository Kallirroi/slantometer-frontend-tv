THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> THE WHOLE FAMILY IS

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
TRAUMATIZED BY THIS EVENT.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
VERY SAD.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
VERY SAD.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> (INAUDIBLE).

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
>> I'M SORRY.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I HAVE NOT.
I HAVE NOT.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HE HAS NOT.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> (QUESTION INAUDIBLE).

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> I HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WITH HIM.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
VERY CLOSE.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> (QUESTION INAUDIBLE).

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> I ACTUALLY SAW HER LAST

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
NOVEMBER WHEN JIM CHAMPION

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
RETIRED.
I SAW HER AT THE RETIREMENT

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PARTY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CHILDREN

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
SINCE THEY LEFT HERE IN 1998.

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS IT WAS

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
1998.
THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING.

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THANKS A LOT.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> THANK YOU.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
>> Bill: LET'S PIECE THIS
TOGETHER HERE.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THOSE ARE SPOKES PEOPLE IN

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
KINGSTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
IS WHERE NANCY LANZA, HER MAIDEN

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
NAME IS CHAMPION.

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
SHE'S THE MOTHER OF THE ALLEGED

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
KILLER BACK HERE IN NEWTOWN,

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
CONNECTICUT.
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WAS DIVORCED MAYBE FOUR YEARS

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AGO, BUT HER HUSBAND, PETER,

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
STILL MADE HIS HOME HERE IN THE

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HOW FAR AWAY IS NOT CLEAR AT THE

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
MOMENT.
AND HIS OTHER SON, RYAN LANZA,

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AGE 24, WHO WAS THE PERSON WHO

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
MANY THOUGHT WAS THE GUILTY

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
PARTY ON THIS EARLY ON, WAS

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
LIVING IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WE WANTED TO BRING THAT YOU

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PIECE

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THIS TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ENTIRE DAY BECAUSE HERE IN

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
CONNECTICUT, POLICE SAY THERE IS

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
STILL NO SIGN, AT LEAST PUBLICLY

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ANYWAY, THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGN

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
OF A MOTIVE.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
BUT WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA AS WE

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
MOVE THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
HERE IS A PICTURE SAID TO BE

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FROM 2005 WHICH WOULD MEAN

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AROUND THE AGE OF 14 SHOWN HERE.

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SOURCES TELLING FOX NEWS HE MAY

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HAVE HAD A DEVELOPMENTAL

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
DISORDER AND PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SHOOTER NOW DESCRIBE HIM AS

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SMART BUT, QUOTE, VERY REMOTE

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
SOCIALLY.
ACCORDING TO STATE POLICE, THE

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
EVIDENCE NOW SUGGESTS THAT NO

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
ONE FROM THE SCHOOL ALLOWED HIM

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
TO GET INSIDE THE BUILDING

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AROUND 9:30 IN THE MORNING

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FRIDAY MORNING.

255
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
INSTEAD SOMEHOW HE FORCED HIS

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WAY IN.

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW.

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
TODAY A LIBRARY CLERK CONFIRMED

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
SHE AND OTHERS INSIDE THE SCHOOL

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
LEARNED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
ONCE THEY HEARD THE GUN FIRE

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
COME ACROSS THE INTERCOM.

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
>> THE INTERCOM IN THE OFFICE

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
WENT OFF AS IF THEY WERE GOING

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT AND THEN

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
WE HEARD SCUFFLING NOISES AND

267
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
STUFF AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
HIT THE BUTTON BY MISTAKE AND

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THEY WERE JUST IN THE OFFICE.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SOY CALLED DOWN THERE AND ONE OF

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THE SECRETARIES ABDOMEN THE

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
PHONE AND SAID THERE IS A

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SHOOTING.

274
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AND THEN YOU BECOME AWARE, WE

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
STARTED HEARING THE GUN SHOTS.

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I YELLED LOCKDOWN TO THE GROUP

277
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
THAT WAS IN OUR ROOM AND I RAN

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ACROSS THE HALL AND TOLD THE

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CLASSROOM ACROSS THE HALL TO

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
LOCK DOWN.

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> SHE HAD A LOT TO SAY EARLIER

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
TODAY.

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
SOME OF THE PICTURES YOU SEE

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
NOW, HUG A TEACHER TODAY, ARE

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
HANGING IN THE BUILDINGS
THROUGHOUT THE AREA OF NEWTOWN.

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THE INVESTIGATION REALLY IN ITS

287
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
EARLY STAGES.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
EARLIER TODAY, THE LEAD POLICE

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
OFFICER FROM THE STATE OF

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
CONNECTICUT SAID THAT IT WILL BE

291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
AT LEAST A DAY OR TWO AT A

292
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
MINIMUM BEFORE THE CRIME SCENE

293
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
IS EVALUATED ENTIRELY INSIDE AND

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
OUTSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, THEY COME TO

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
GRIPS WITH THE LOSS OF 26 OF

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THEIR OWN AND HOW IN THE WORLD

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
DO YOU BEGIN TO DO THAT?

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THAT SIGN HANGS OUTSIDE OF A

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
RESTAURANT ENCOURAGING FOLKS TO

301
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
HUG A TEACHER AND THERE ARE MANY

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
OF US WHO FEEL THAT WAY TODAY

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
MOLLY LINE IS WITH ME KNOW.

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
VICTIMS?
GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
>> THEY RELEASED THIS HEART

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
BREAKING LIST.
WE KNEW IT WAS COMING.

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE 20

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
CHILDREN'S NAMES AND SIX ADULTS.

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL SIX OF

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THOSE ADULTS WERE WOMEN THAT

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
WERE AT THE SCHOOL THAT DAY

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
STUDENTS.

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THAT THERE WERE 20 CHILDREN
THERE AND AS YOU MENTIONED, SOME

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
OF THESE NAMES, THESE ARE NAMES

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
YOU HEAR IN ANY CLASSROOM,

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
CHARLOTTE, CHASE, JESSE, EMILY,

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
AS YOU MENTIONED.

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WE WATCHED HER FATHER SPEAK

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
EARLIER TONIGHT.

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
LITTLE KIDS THAT WERE SIX AND

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SEVEN YEARS OLD.

325
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
LITTLE, LITTLE CHILDREN.

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITTLE GIRLS

327
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
AND LITTLE BOYS.

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THEY WERE LITERALLY GUNNED DOWN

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
IN THEIR FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM

330
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WEARING WHAT THEIR PARENTS

331
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
DRESSED THEM IN THAT DAY.

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THE NORMAL CHEERFUL CLOTHES IS

333
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THE WAY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
DESCRIBED IT.

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>> Bill: HIS PRESS CONFERENCE I

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THOUGHT WAS ESPECIALLY CHILLING.

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE LINE OF

338
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
WORK THIS MAN IS IN, GENTLEMAN

339
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
NAMED WAYNE CARVER, I THINK IT

340
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WAS LIKELY JOLTING AND JARRING

341
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TO

342
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
HIM TELL US ABOUT WHAT HE IS

343
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
LEARNING ABOUT HOW SOME OF THESE

344
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
CHILDREN DIED.

345
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> HE DID SPEAK SOMETIMES IN

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
CLINICAL TERMS, WHICH THAT CAN

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
BE A LITTLE JARRING FOR PEOPLE

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THAT ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
HAPPENED.

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
HE ESSENTIALLY SAID THERE WERE

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
MULTIPLE GUN SHOTS WOUNDS TO

352
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
EVERYONE THAT WAS KILLED, THAT

353
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
HIS PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

354
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
SEVEN OF THE VICTIMS, EACH OF

355
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THEM HAD BETWEEN THREE AND 11

356
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
GUN SHOTS THAT, INCLUDED THE

357
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
CHILDREN, THAT INCLUDED THE

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
ADULTS.
NO ONE ESCAPED THE WRATH OF THIS

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
GUN WHICH HE BELIEVES THE IMPACT

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
CAME FROM THE RIFLE THAT THEY

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BELIEVE WAS USED.

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

363
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
GUNS INVOLVED IN THE SCENE,

364
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THERE WERE OTHER GUNS FOUND, BUT

365
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY IF
THEY WERE USED.

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GUNSHOT

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
WOUNDS ON THE VICTIM, THE

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER BELIEVES IT WAS

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THE RIFLE.

370
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> Bill: THANK YOU.
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRAM AS WE

YOUNGER BROTHER, ADAM?

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T EVEN

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
KNOW HE HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER

433
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
UNTIL FRIDAY MORNING.

434
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
LED TO A LOT OF CONFUSION AND

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
MISINFORMATION.
MOSTLY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HIM

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW A LOT OF

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT HIS

438
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
FAMILY.
OTHER THAN THAT, YEAH.

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST I HEARD ABOUT

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
IT.
>> Bill: YOU'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A

441
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
YEAR AND A HALF AND A

442
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS BROTHER

443
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
NEVER CAME UP?

444
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> CORRECT.

445
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS AS MUCH

446
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
ABOUT MY FAMILY EITHER.

447
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
>> Bill: THERE IS A REPORT

448
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
EARLIER TODAY THAT THESE TWO

449
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
BROTHERS HAVE NOT HAD CONTACT

450
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS.

451
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
NOW, THAT'S UNCONFIRMED.

452
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

453
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
BUT BASED ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP

454
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AND THE WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING

455
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
IT, I WOULD IMAGINE YOU DON'T

456
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT, DO

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
YOU?

458
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> I DON'T.
I'VE HEARD THAT, TOO.

459
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT RYAN

460
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
HIMSELF IS A VERY QUIET AND

461
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
SOMEWHAT PRIVATE GUY.

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
IT'S NOT UNLIKE WHAT WE'RE

463
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
HEARING ABOUT ADAM.

464
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DRAW

465
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
FROM THAT OTHER THAN THE FACT

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THAT HE JUST DOESN'T OPEN UP TOO

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
EASILY, BUT IT WAS NEVER REALLY

468
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
IN ANYONE'S POSITION TO TRY TO

469
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
PRY IT OUT OF HIM.

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
>> Bill: HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM

471
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
TODAY?
DID YOU TALK TO HIM YESTERDAY?

472
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST CONVERSATION?

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>> YESTERDAY AT ABOUT

474
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
2:00 O'CLOCK, THEREABOUTS.

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I JUST SENT HIM A MESSAGE ON

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
FACEBOOK AS I REALIZED THAT THE

477
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

478
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
AND THE REALITY OF WHAT WAS

479
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
GOING ON, JUST TO SEE IF HE WAS

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
OKAY AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HE RESPONDED BACK WITH --

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
>> Bill: WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
>> HE JUST SAID -- ALL HE SAID

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WAS, IT WAS MY BROTHER, OH, MY

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
GOD.
I THINK MY MOM IS DEAD.

486
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
AND THEN THAT WAS THE LAST I

487
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
HEARD FROM HIM.

488
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM TODAY

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000

ALL THIS COMING NOW ONLY DAYS

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
AFTER AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TOOK

560
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
HERSELF OUT OF CONTENTION FOR

561
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THE JOB.

562
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT OFFICIALLY

563
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000

OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT ED HENRY TRACKING

BASICALLY A DONE DEAL NOW.

571
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
PICK SENATOR JOHN KERRY.

573
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IT'S LIKE LOW TO HAPPEN IN A

574
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
MATTER OF DAYS.

575
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THERE IS REALLY ONLY TWO THINGS

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
HOLING THIS UP RIGHT NOW.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THAT IS NUMBER ONE, THE

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, ENTIRELY NEW

580

NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

581
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
THAT WOULD INCLUDE A NEW

582
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
PENTAGON CHIEF, A NEW C.I.A.

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000

AT THE PENTAGON, MORE

587
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
COMPLICATED.
THE LIKELY PICK STILL IS CHUCK

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
HAGEL.

589
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
BIPARTISANSHIP IN THE CABINET.

590
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM IN

591
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
RECENT DAYS FROM SOME FOLKS

592
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000

ISRAEL WAS PERHAPS NOT STRONG

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
ENOUGH FOR SOME.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS WORKING

596
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
THROUGH THOSE CONCERNS --

597
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000

THIS AFTER FAINTING AND

SUFFERING A CONCUSSION.

601
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THIS WAS BREAKING NEWS EARLIER

602
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
TODAY.

603
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
THIS IS SOMETHING WE DID NOT

604
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
KNOW.

605
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS

606
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
THAT IT HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF

607
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
A STOMACH VIRUS,  WHICH HAS LEFT

608
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SECRETARY CLINTON WEAK AND

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
DEHYDRATED.

610
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THE SECRETARY ALREADY SKIPPING

611
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000

AND THE PERSIAN GULF BECAUSE OF

613
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000

LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, IT HAS

740
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BEEN PEACEFUL FOR SO LONG.

741
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
THE LAST SERIOUS CRIME REPORTED

742
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
HERE TWO YEARS AGO IN 2010.

743
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
TODAY A MUCH DIFFERENT PICTURE.

744
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
PART OF THAT PICTURE, AS WE MOVE

745
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IS ANOTHER

746
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIAL WHERE WE HAVE

747
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
SEEN PEOPLE DROP OFF FLOWERS

748
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON HERE.

749
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THIS IS THE FLAG POLE IN

750
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
NEWTOWN.

751
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
IT IS A TOWN LANDMARK, TEN

752
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
STORIES TALL, MORE THAN 100 FEET

753
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
HERE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE

754
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
TOWN.
THIS FLAG IS AT HALF-STAFF, THE

755
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
PRESIDENT ORDERED THEM

756
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ALL

757
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
MILITARY INSTITUTIONS YESTERDAY

758
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
AFTERNOON.

759
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
IF YOU WERE TO DRIVE TWO MILES

760
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
DOWN THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY

761
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
ROAD, THAT IS WHERE YOU WOULD

762
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
FIND THE SCENE OF CARNAGE THAT

763
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
AMERICA FOUND YESTERDAY.

764
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I MENTIONED ROBBIE PARKER, THE

765
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
FATHER OF YOUNG EMILY A MOMENT

766
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AGO.
I WANT TO BRING IN THE GOVERNOR,

767
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
MIKE HUCKABEE.

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
YOU'VE HAD SO MANY ELOQUENT

769
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THINGS TO SAY THROUGHOUT THE DAY

770
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
TODAY.
I GUESS WHAT STRUCK ME SO MUCH

771
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
LISTENING TO ROBBIE PARKER, HE

772
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SAYS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET

773
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THROUGH THIS.

774
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
AND THEN HE SAID, THE BEST THING

775
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I CAN DO IS HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

776
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
HOW ARE YOU PIECING THIS

777
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
TOGETHER TONIGHT, GOVERNOR?

778
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
>> IT WAS SO ELOQUENT TO HEAR

779
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
HIM.
I TELL YOU WHAT STRUCK ME TODAY,

780
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT THE

781
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
LIST OF THESE KIDS, THEIR NAMES,

782
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THEIR AGES, IT STARTED MAKING IT

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
MORE REAL, I THINK, THEN IT'S

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
BEEN SINCE IT FIRST WAS

785
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ANNOUNCED.

786
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE THESE

787
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
CHILDREN HAD NAMES AND ADDRESSES

788
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND

789
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
MOTHERS, FATHERS, AUNTS, UNCLES,

790
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
GRANDPARENTS AND YOU REALIZE THE

791
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
HORRIFIC TRAGEDY, DEEPLY

792
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
PERSONNEL.
THEN TO SEE THIS FATHER OF EMILY

793
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
PARKER EXPRESS THAT GRIEF AND

794
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
REALLY JUST REACH OUT.

795
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I THINK IT MAKES ALL OF THIS I

796
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
GUESS A STARK REMINDER OF HOW

797
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
HORRIBLE THE TRAGEDY IS, BUT

798
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
ALSO HOW PEOPLE LEARN TO COPE.

799
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS TRYING TO

800
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
DO.
I THINK EVERYBODY IS JUST

801
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
LEARNING TO TRY TO COPE WITH

802
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GRIEF.

803
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
>> Bill: SO MANY HAVE TOLD ME

804
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
JUST IN THE PAST DAY THAT THEY

805
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
WILL TURN ON THEIR TELEVISION

806
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
AND JUST LEAVE IT ON AND WATCH

807
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
AND CRY AND DO THAT FOR HOURS.

808
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THAT'S PART OF THIS PROCESS OF

809
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
GRIEF, IS IT NOT?

810
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
>> IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROCESS.

811
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WHAT, CAN

812
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WE DO?
WHAT CAN WE SAY?

813
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I THINK THE LESS WE SAY THE

814
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
BETTER.
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK

815
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN GRIEF, THEY

816
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
DON'T WANT TO HEAR OUR WORDS.

817
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THEY WANT O FEEL OUR TOUCH.

818
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE

819
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THERE WITH THEM, THAT WE HAVEN'T

820
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
ABANDONED THEM AND THERE ISN'T

821
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
ANYTHING ANYBODY CAN SAY THAT

822
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
MAKES THIS BETTER.

823
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I WAS REMINDED EARLIER TODAY

824
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH JOHN

825
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
SCOTT, THE SHORTEST VERSE IN THE

826
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
BIBLE MAY BE THE MOST POWERFUL,

827
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
JESUS WEPT.

828
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
HE LEFT HAND HIS FRIEND DIED AND

829
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
HE CRIED ABOUT IT.

830
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
THAT SORT OF SAYS IT ALL, THAT

831
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
SOMETIMES THE MOST POWERFUL

832
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET

833
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THROUGH OUR OWN GRIEF IS TO

834
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE IT AND BE

835
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
HONEST ABOUT IT AND EXPRESS IT.

836
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
DON'T HOLD THE TEARS BACK, BUT

837
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
LET THEM FLOW.

838
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IT'S HOW WE WERE HARD WIRED IN

839
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS AND

840
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A

841
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
DEEP HUMAN PAIN THAT IS GOING ON

842
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
INSIDE OF US.

843
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
>> Bill: YOU KNOW, YOUR PREVIOUS

844
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
LIFE, YOU WERE A GOVERNOR OF

845
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ARKANSAS.

846
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
>> YES.
>> Bill: YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH

847
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
NATURAL DISASTERS AND HUMAN

848
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
DISASTERS AND THE TRAGEDY THAT

849
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
MAN INFLICTS UPON OTHER MEN AND

850
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
YOU HAD TO FACE THOSE VICTIMS OR

851
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
YOU HAD TO FACE THOSE WHO WERE

852
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
TRYING TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR OWN

853
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
LIVES.

854
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WHAT DID YOU DO AS THE HEAD OF

855
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THAT STATE?

856
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> I REMEMBER THE DAY AFTER THE

857
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
JONESBORO SHOOTING IN MARCH OF

858
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
1998, WHICH AN 11 AND

859
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
12-YEAR-OLD OPENED FIRED ON

860
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THEIR CLASSMATES AND TEACHERS.

861
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
IT WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC THING I

862
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WENT THROUGH AS A GOVERNORMENT I

863
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
SPENT THE NEXT DAY VISITING THE

864
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
SURVIVORS IN THE HOSPITAL AND

865
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THEN I MET WITH THE ENTIRE STAFF

866
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
OF THE SCHOOL.

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, NO PRESS.

868
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
IT WAS A VOCA -- VOCA THAT IS

869
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
RIGHTIC EXPERIENCE, IT WAS A LOT

870
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
OF CRYING, A LOT OF PEOPLE

871
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SHARING THEIR FEELINGS TOWARD

872
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
THOSE WHO HAD BEEN KILLED AND

873
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD

874
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
HAPPENED.

875
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
AGAIN, IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO

876
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT.

877
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
NOBODY CAN IMAGINE THAT KIDS

878
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THAT AGE COULD DO SOMETHING AND

879
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
LEAVE THAT MUCH CARNAGE AND THAT

880
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
MUCH PAIN BEHIND.

881
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO WILL

882
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
BE QUICK TO SAY OKAY.

883
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE TO

884
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
PREVENT IT?

885
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR

886
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
PEOPLE TO MAKE ALL THE SECOND

887
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
GUESSING THEY WANT TO MAKE.

888
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT

889
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS BRING AS

890
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
MUCH COMFORT AS POSSIBLE.

891
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE

892
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
WHY OR -- WE WON'T UNDERSTAND

893
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
ALL OF THE WAYS TO FIX THIS.

894
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR

895
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
TO US WORK ON THAT.

896
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY AS A

897
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
COUNTRY GRIEVE AND TO EXPRESS

898
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
OUR PRAYERS AND CONCERNS FOR

899
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
THESE WHO HAVE THE MOST AMAZING

900
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
GRIEF OF ALL AND THAT'S THE

901
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN.

902
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> Bill: GOVERNOR, THANK YOU.

903
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW AND I WAS

904
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
NOT AWARE OF MANY SCHOOLS FROM

905
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

906
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
GRADE THAT WENT INTO LOCKDOWN AT

907
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING.

908
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
BUT THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT HAD

909
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
THAT SAFETY FEATURE ALREADY

910
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
IMPLEMENTED IN THE SCHOOL.

911
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
AND AS IT TURNS OUT, IT NEEDED

912
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
IT AND IN THE END, IT PROBABLY

913
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
NEEDED MORE THAN THAT.

914
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IN NEW

915
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
YORK CITY, BUT UP HERE IN THE

916
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
COUNTRY SIDE AND TOWN OF 27,000,

917
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
CHECK OUT OF THE THE GOVERNOR

918
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
TONIGHT AT 8:00  O'CLOCK EASTERN

919
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
TIME.
HUCKABEE COMES YOUR WAY THERE.

920
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
HE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE

921
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN IN HIS OWN

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
DETAILS SLOWLY STARTING TO MORE

927
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
THAN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

928
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
YESTERDAY INSIDE THE ELEMENTARY

929
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SCHOOL.
SANDY HOOK.

930
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
AS THAT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES,

931
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
POLICE ARE URGING PATIENCE.

932
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THERE HAS BEEN A STATE TROOPER

933
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
ASSIGNED TO EVERY FAMILY OF THE

934
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
VICTIMS AND THEY HAVE WARNED THE

935
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
MEDIA REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE

936
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
DAY TODAY, GIVE THEM THEIR

937
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SPACE.

938
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
GIVE THEM THE COMPASSION THAT

939
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
THEY NEED NOW.

940
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WE WILL RESPECT THAT AS OUR

941
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
COVERAGE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT

942
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THE EVENING HERE.

943
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
>> THIS STILL IS AN ACTIVE CASE.

944
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
WE ARE STILL WORKING AND

945
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ACTIVELY PURSUING LEADS.

946
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
>> WE CAN SHOW AND SHARE WITH

947
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
EACH OTHER THE GRIEF WE FEEL FOR

948
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO WERE

949
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
KILLED.

950
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

951
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
LOVED ONES.

952
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> Bill: AS VECTORS TRY TO PIECE

953
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT

954
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
GOES INTO INVESTIGATING SUCH A

955
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
TERRIBLE CRIME SCENE.

956
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
WHERE DO YOU START?

957
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
AT THE NEW YORK POLICE

958
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
DEPARTMENT, PRESIDENT, GOOD

959
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
EVENING TO YOU.

960
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE

961
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT UP HERE.

962
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN STANDOUT

963
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
GENTLEMEN FOR THE PAST DAY AND A

964
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
HALF.
AT TIMES YOU WANT THEM TO GIVE

965
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
MORE INFORMATION, BUT YOU CAN

966
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

967
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THIS THE

968
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
RIGHT WAY.

969
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
WHAT'S YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT

970
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR?

971
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
>> SO FAR THEY'VE DONE A GREAT

972
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
JOB AND REALLY GETTING EVERYBODY

973
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
TOGETHER AND USING ALL THE

974
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS, ALL

975
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
RESOURCES, TALKING TO THE MEDIA.

976
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THEY TELL THE FAMILIES WHAT'S

977
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
GOING ON A LOT MORE THAN THEY

978
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WOULD THE MEDIA.

979
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

980
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
BUT SPEAKING FOR ALL LAW

981
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
ENFORCEMENT, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

982
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
WE ALL HAVE HAVE A HEAVY HEART

983
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
'CAUSE HOW WE THINK IS A LOT

984
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DIFFERENT.

985
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SOMETIMES WE THINK OF THE CRIME

986
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
SCENE.
SO WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

987
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
VISUALIZE THIS GUY GOING INTO

988
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THE CLASSROOM WITH THAT RIFLE

989
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
AND HOW HE COULD SHOOT THOSE

990
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
MANY PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT THE

991
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
CRIME SCENE IS PUTTING TOGETHER,

992
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
HOW THAT HAPPENS.

993
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THEY ALMOST VISUALIZE IT.

994
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
SO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A HEAVY

995
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
HEART JUST PUTTING THIS THING

996
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
TOGETHER AND LOOKING AT KIDS

997
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
THAT ARE SHOT SO MUCH.

998
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
YOU KNOW, HAVING THIS GUY SHOOT

999
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THEM LIKE THAT, IT REALLY WASN'T

1000
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
A HARD THING FOR HIM TO DO.

1001
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
>> Bill: SADLY, YOU'RE RIGHT

1002
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
ABOUT THAT LAST COMMENT.

1003
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE TWO

1004
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
CRIME SCENES.

1005
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
NOT JUST AT THE SCHOOL, BUT AT

1006
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
THE HOME OF THE MOTHER AND

1007
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
APPARENTLY WHERE THIS

1008
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
21-YEAR-OLD KILLER WAS LIVING.

1009
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
WHAT THE POLICE SAID EARLIER IS

1010
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THAT THE MOTHER'S HOME, AND I'M

1011
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
QUOTING NOW -- HAS PRODUCED SOME

1012
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
GOOD EVIDENCE FOR INVESTIGATORS.

1013
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE DETAIL IN

1014
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THAT.
WE'RE TRYING TO READ THROUGH THE

1015
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
LINES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

1016
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
IS.

1017
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
PUBLICLY WE DO NOT KNOW.

1018
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
BUT THE HOME MAY LEAD TO MOTIVE,

1019
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
RIGHT, GILL?

1020
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
>> DEFINITELY.

1021
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
WHERE THAT STATEMENT CAME OUT,

1022
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
SURE, THEY THINK OF WHAT

1023
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
HAPPENED MAYBE THROUGH HIS

1024
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
EMOTIONAL STATE.
MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS HE DID.

1025
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
MAYBE PICTURES THAT HE HAS IN

1026
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THERE.

1027
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'M NOT TOO SURE THEY FOUND
ANYTHING ON THE COMPUTER OR

1028
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ANYTHING ELSE.

1029
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
BUT THEY LOOK AT HIS WHOLE

1030
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
HISTORY, WHO DID HE TALK TO AND

1031
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
ALL THAT.

1032
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THAT PICTURE IS GOING TO COME

1033
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
OUT OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE

1034
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
REALLY WE ALL WANT TO KNOW WHY

1035
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
AND THE FAMILIES MORE THAN

1036
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
ANYBODY ELSE Y. THAT'S A

1037
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
FRUSTRATING THING.
THE POLICE, YOU KNOW HOW ALL THE

1038
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
INFORMATION CAME OUT AND A LOT

1039
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
WAS WRONG.
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO COME OUT

1040
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
WITH THAT INFORMATION.

1041
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
SO THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TIME

1042
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
WITH THIS.

1043
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

1044
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THEY'RE TALKING TO THE FAMILIES.

1045
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
SO THEY HAVE EVERYTHING REALLY

1046
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
UNDER CONTROL UNDER THESE

1047
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SITUATIONS.

1048
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
>> Bill: GILL, THANK YOU.

1049
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
THANK YOU, SIR.

1050
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WE WERE TOLD EARLIER TODAY THAT

1051
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
AT LEAST MONDAY AT THE EARLIEST

1052
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
NOW BEFORE THEY CAN CLEAR THE

1053
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
SCENE FROM A CRIMINAL

1054
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
INVESTIGATION STANDPOINT AT THE

1055
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1056
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THAT'S AT LEAST 48 HOURS AWAY.

1057
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
AND THEY WERE CAREFUL NOT TO PUT

1058
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AN EXACT TIME FRAME ON IT, WHICH

1059
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH

1060
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO GO

1061
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THROUGH INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

1062
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WE ARE WATCHING THE STORY

1063
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING TONIGHT.

1064
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THERE IS SOME OTHER NEWS,

1065
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THOUGH.

1066
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
INCLUDING THE HISTORIC VOTE
UNDERWAY IN EGYPT THAT COULD

1067
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
SHAPE THE FUTURE NOT ONLY FOR

1068
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THAT CRITICAL NATION AND MIDDLE

1069
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
EASTERN POLITICS, BUT FOR ALL

1070
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
POLITICS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE

1071
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
EAST.
SO WE ARE LIVE IN CAIRO TRACKING

1072
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THAT.

1073
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
ALSO A LOOK AT HOW THE DEADLY

1074
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
SHOOTING HERE IN NEWTOWN COULD

1075
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
CHANGE HOW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

1076
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
COUNTRY HANDLE THEIR OWN

1077
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
SECURITY AS OUR COVERAGE

1078
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
CONTINUES.

1079
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
>> FORTIFY OUR ELEMENTARY

1080
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SCHOOLS AND MAKE THEM LIKE A

1081
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
FORT TEXAS RANGERS -- FORTRESS,

1082
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
OUR SOCIETY SHOULD NOT BE THAT

1083
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WAY
EAT GOOD FATS.

1084
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
AVOID BAD.

1085
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
DON'T GO OVER 2000...

1086
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
1200 CALORIES A DAY.

1087
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.

1088
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.

1089
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
SO I'M NOT LISTENING...

1090
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.

1091
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION
WHEN I SEE IT:

1092
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
GREAT GRAINS.

1093
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
GREAT GRAINS CEREAL STARTS
WHOLE AND STAYS WHOLE.

1094
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
SEE THE SEAM?

1095
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
NOTHING LIKE NATURALRAINS.

1096
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.

1097
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
GREAT GRAINS.

1098
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
SEARCH GREAT GRAINS
AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

1099
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
FOR MULTI GRAIN FLAKES TT ARE
ANXCELLENT SOURCE OF FIBER

1100
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
TRY GREAT GRAINS
BANANA NUT CRUNCH

1101
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
AND CRANBERRY ALMOND CRUNCH.

1102
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>> Bill: I MENTIONED EARLIER

1103
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
THAT THE SCHOOL HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1104
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000

1223
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
