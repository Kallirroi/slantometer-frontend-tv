00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AND THEN I WANTED
TO TAKE OWEN OUT

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
FOR A BIRTHDAY BANANA SPLIT
AT SERENDIPITY.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I JUST WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE ROCKY WITH US LATELY.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
NOTHING SMOOTHES ROCKY
LIKE ROCKY ROAD.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
JUST REMEMBER, IT'S A SCHOOL
NIGHT. BE HOME BY MIDNIGHT.
DAD, I'LL BE HOME BY 9:00.

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
YEAH, BYE, DARLING.
LOVE YOU. BYE, GUYS.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
AH, YOUNG LOVE--
FIRST BANANA SPLITS,

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THEN SPLITTING ASSETS.
AH, MOTHER. YOU ARE
A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I KNOW.

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
OOPS.
I'M OFF TO AN AUDITION.
AND I HAVE A BET TO WIN.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
YES, DETECTIVE.
THAT'S MY CREDIT CARD.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST
NIGHT. SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WHEN I LEFT HER THERE,
SHE WAS ALIVE.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE,
MS. ROSSI?
AROUND 7:00.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THEN WHERE DID YOU GO?
TO DRINKS WITH OTHER
ASSOCIATES FROM MY FIRM.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I WAS AT THE GANSEVOORT BAR
UNTIL 11:00.

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
DID YOU MAKE PLANS
TO HAVE DINNER TOGETHER,

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OR DID YOU JUST SHOW UP?

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SHE CALLED ME.
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO TALK.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
BUT I-I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T KNOW.

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT?

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I SHOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I SHOULD'VE DONE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW? I--

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
WHY DID SHE CALL, MS. ROSSI?

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SHE NEEDED MY ADVICE
AS A LAWYER.

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SOMETHING HAPPENED LAST FRIDAY,
SOMETHING BAD.
WHAT?

197
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SHE WOULDN'T SAY, BUT I KNEW
IT WAS ONE OF HER PATIENTS.

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AGAINST WHO?
WHOM.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
SHE WOULDN'T SAY.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
GOD.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED
WITH HER.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HER
OFF THE HOOK.

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
(sighs)

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
LOOKS LIKE ASHLEY
TOOK HER OATH SERIOUSLY.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
HER HUSBAND HAD NO IDEA

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THAT SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENED ON FRIDAY.

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
NOT GET THEM KILLED.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
SO THE VIC'S GIRLFRIEND?
ALIBI IS GOOD.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
COWORKERS CONFIRM THAT SHE
ARRIVED FOR DRINKS AT 7:15,

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
LEFT AT 11:00.

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE HUSBAND'S BUDDY
PLACES HIM AT THE GARDEN

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FROM 7:00 TILL ABOUT 10:00.

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHICH LEAVES US
WITH FRIDAY'S PATIENTS.

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I SURE WOULD LIKE A PEEK
AT DR. COSWAY'S NOTES.
NOT WITHOUT A WARRANT.
WE START BY RUNNING THE NAMES.

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
IF HE THREATENED
AND THEN KILLED HER,

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
HE'S PROBABLY GOT
VIOLENT PRIORS.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ONCE AGAIN, MR. AND MRS. MARX,
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THANK YOU.

221

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ANY HOT LEADS?

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ANY HOT LEADS?
MATTER OF FACT, YES.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000

FOR A WALK EVERY NIGHT.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
AND GUESS WHO HANGS
IN THE PARK

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000

WAS POPPED.

DO THEY HANG OUT THERE
REGULARLY?

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEN THEY DIDN'T DO IT. IF
THEY'RE KNOWN TO HANG OUT THERE,

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THEN THEY'RE GONNA KNOW
THEY'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT.

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000

WITH OUR CONFIDENCE.
IF I WAS TRYING TO MESS
WITH YOUR CONFIDENCE,

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT OUR VICTIM
TALKED TO HER LAWYER FRIEND

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
ON THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED
ABOUT A RESTRAINING ORDER.
AND DO YOU HAVE A SUSPECT?

237

WE'RE NARROWING IT DOWN.

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that cause chronic
widespread pain.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I learned Lyrica can provide
significant relief

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
from fibromyalgia pain.

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000

So now I can do more of

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Lyrica may cause serious

or suicidal thoughts or actions.

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000

or any swelling or
affected breathing or skin,

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
or changes in eyesight,
including blurry vision

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
or muscle pain with fever
or tired feeling.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
weight gain, and swelling of
hands, legs and feet.

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking Lyrica.

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't drive or use machinery

IN THE LITTLE WAITING ROOM

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
BEFORE OUR SESSION.
WE HEAR ALL THIS YELLING.
ABOUT WHAT?

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS GUY WAS
CURSING DOC COSWAY OUT BIG-TIME.

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
AND IT WAS KINDA SCARY.
I WAS TEMPTED TO GO IN THERE,

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
BUT THEN WE HEARD
THE GUY LEAVE.
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT HIS FACE?

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
NO, NO, NO. HE WENT OUT
THE HALLWAY DOOR. DOC GOT US.

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
SHE WAS RATTLED, BUT SHE DID
OUR SESSION ANYWAY.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I GOT A FEELING
THIS ISN'T OUR GUY.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
(Beckett)
HINKLE. EVAN HINKLE.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
HE'S HAD THE APPOINTMENT
BEFORE THE ROSSES

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
EVERY WEEK
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
THE GUY IS CLEAN.
THERE'S NO RECORD OF ANYTHING.

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
TWO STRAIGHT YEARS
OF THERAPY--

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
MAYBE HE JUST SNAPPED.M IN.VE U.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'M GONNA GO GET A COFFEE.

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
ESPOSITO TIPPED ME OFF
TO THE BET.

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
THOUGHT I'D TOSS
A LITTLE TOWARDS OURS.

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
TOSS AWAY, MY FRIEND.AD THE WORD

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
IF ANYONE ELSE
WANTS A TASTE.

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
(Ryan) LET'S GO.
COME ON, BIG FELLA.

353
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
COME ON.

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
TO THE LEFT, OVER HERE.

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,AT,
LOOKING FOR A GANG MEMBER, WE

356
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
LIKE A TEENAGER.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
ALIBIED OUT.

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
SO WHO'S  TO BE WORKING IN TUGGD
TO BE WORKING IN THE SAME AREA

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THE SAME NIGHT
OUR VIC WAS KILLED.
OH, YEAH. HE WAS PICKED UP
WITH A .45 ON HIM,

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
THE SAME ROUND

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THAT WAS FOUND IN OUR VIC.

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
JUST WAITING ON BALLISTICS,
UNLESHE HASN'T ASKED IRST.
SO WHERE'S HIS LAWYER?A.

362
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THAT WAS FOOH, WHOA, WHOA.
HE HASN'T ASKED FOR ONE.

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
WELL, I KNOW A GUY.

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER, CASTLE?
ARE YOU GETTING WORRIED?

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
WOR-WORRIED?
I'LL MAKE YOU CRY.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
YOU WANT TO BET
OR MAYBE DOUBLE DOWN?

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT MONEY. HUMILIATION.

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
HMM.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
LOSER WEARS A DRESS
TO THE PRECINCT FOR A WEEK.

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
WHY STOP THERE?
LOSER ALSO SHAVES HIS HEAD.

371
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
OR ARE YOU CHICKEN?

372
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
(snaps fingers)

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
YOU'RE ON, HONEY MILK.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
HONEY MILK.

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
DAMN IT.

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
FOR THE RECORD, MR. HINKLE,
YOU ARE ADMITTING

377
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THAT YOU WERE
DR. COSWAY'S 1:00 APPOINTMENT?
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
I KNEW IT.

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
FIRST TIME I MET HER,
I KNEW SHE'D LEAVE ME.

379
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN?
WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP LEAVING ME?

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE YOU,
MR. HINKLE.

381
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
SHE WAS MURDERED.
YEAH, JUST LIKE
MY FIRST WIFE.

382
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
YOUR FIRST WIFE
WAS MURDERED?

383
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THAT'S RIGHT.
I SMOTHERED HER TO DEATH.

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I MURDERED HER WITH LOVE.

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
THAT'S WHY SHE LEFT.

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
JUST TELL US ABOUT
YOUR LAST APPOINTMENT

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WITH DR. COSWAY.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO MAKE PROGRESS.

390
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU KNOW THE IRONY HERE?

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
HER DEATH IS MY MOMENT
OF GREATEST CRISIS,

392
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
AND I DON'T HAVE HER
TO LEAN ON. (chuckles)

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
WHAT WAS
ALL THE SCREAMING ABOUT

394
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
AT THE APPOINTMENT
LAST FRIDAY?

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
SCREAM--LAST FRIDAY? I D--
I DID NOT SEE HER LAST FRIDAY.

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
YOU'RE IN THE BOOKS.

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
YOU'RE, WITH AN APOSTROPHE.

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
YEAH, WELL, I CANCELED
AN HOUR BEFORE.

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
YOU CANCELED?
YES. YES, I WAS HAVING
CHEST PAINS.

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I WENT TO THE E.R.
AT ST. VINCENT'S.

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
$15,000 LATER, IT TURNS OUT

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I WAS JUST HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK ABOUT MOTHER.

403
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
YOU KNOW...

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
(exhales deeply)

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
(exhales)

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
(Beckett) I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE. THANK YOU.

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW,
AT LEAST DR. COSWAY

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
DIDN'T CHARGE MOT?ST-MINUT.
WHY NOT?

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
OH, SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA
HAVE LUNCH WITH HER HUSBAND,

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
SO IT WAS TIME WELL SPENT.
THANK YOU, MR. HINKLE.

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THANK YOU.

412
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE,

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
BUT IT'S NOT IRONIC THAT
DR. COSWAY IS NOT HERE

414
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
FOR YOU TO LEAN ON.

415
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
IT'S JUST SIMPLY TRAGIC.

416
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
IT WOULD BE IRONIC IF HER DEATH
MADE YOU FEEL BETTER.
CASTLE.

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
JUST--YOU CAN...

418
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
WHAT'S WITH THE SUPER COP?

419
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
OKAY, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
WELL, I'M DOWN FOR $50.
YOU KNOW THAT.
(Castle) UH-HUH.

422
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WELL... (clears throat)

423
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SO WHAT YOU GOT?

424
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I JUST GOT A PING
ON ASHLEY'S CREDIT CARD.

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
A LUNCH CHARGE AT PETIT BISTRO,
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HER OFFICE.

426
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AND
THE HOSTESS CONFIRMED

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THAT ASHLEY AND JASON WERE
HAVING LUNCH THERE ON FRIDAY.

428
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AND THE ONLY REASON
SHE REMEMBERS IT

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IS BECAUSE THEY WERE
MAKING KIND OF A SCENE.
HE'S OUR SCREAMER.

430
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THEY WERE ARGUING ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE OFFICE.
HE'S THE ONE SHE WAS GETTING
THE RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST.

431
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
JASON'S ALIBI THAT HE WAS
AT THE GAME WITH HIS FRIEND

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
FEEL A LITTLE SQUISHY TO YOU?
LIKE A WORMY APPLE.

433
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
HEY, KARPOWSKI.

434
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
YO.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BETTER LOOK
AT JASON COSWAY?

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
HEY, MAN. THAT'S A SAFE BET.
YOU BETTER GO FOR IT.

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WORK SITUATION, FINANCIALS
AND HOTEL BILLS.
(mouths words)

437
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
YEAH, OKAY. COPY THAT.

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WANT A COFFEE?
(man) GIVE IT TO HIM.

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
NO. THANKS.

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
(man) ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

441
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
(officers speaking indistinctly)

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
(pen clatters)

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
HEY, STEGNER.

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
JUST... ADMIRING
THE GREAT BOARD WORK, BECKETT.

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
CARE TO SHARE
ANY INSIGHT?

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I REALLY NEED TO...

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
GO FILE.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
UH-HUH.

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO TAKE THAT OFF YOUR HANDS.

450
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
(Castle speaks indistinctly)
SON OF A..!

451
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000

452
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
GIRL SCOUT COOKIE ORDERS.

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
HUH. GIRL SCOUT
COOKIE ORDERS.

454
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
YEAH, I'M JUST
HELPING OUT THE TROOP.

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
FUNNY. I DIDN'T REALIZE
ALEXIS WAS A GIRL SCOUT.

456
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
OH, I KNOW.

457
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
SHE'S GOT SO MANY ACTIVITIES,
I CAN BARELY KEEP TRACK.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
FREAKIN' GREAT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
BALLISTICS SCREWED US.
BALLISTICS SCREWED US.

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
OUR MUGGER'S GUN DOESN'T MATCH
THE BULLET TAKEN FROM OUR VIC.

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
OING ON?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
BETTING ON MURDER CASES,
GUYS? REALLY?

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WHOA. WHAT?
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU,
IT'S GIRL SCOUT ORD--

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
GIRL SCOUT COOKIES
ARE SOLD IN FEBRUARY.

466
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
YOU GUYS SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.

468
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
LISTEN... I'M SORRY.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.
I JUST THOUGHT--
BECKETT, YOU ARE NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
OH, THE BAR ON UNBELIEVABLE
IS PRETTY HIGH RIGHT NOW.

CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THAT?
YES, I'M SURE SOMEONE CAN.
MAYBE A FRIEND.

486
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
WELL, HER BEST FRIEND BRANDY

487
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT THE LIFE INSURANCE,

488
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
BUT SHE DID KNOW ABOUT
A RESTRAINING ORDERR

489
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT YOUR WIFE WAS TRYING
TO GET AGAINST YOU.
THAT'S... INSANE.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

YOU WANT TO TELL US
ABOUT LAST FRIDAY?

ESY STUFF

662
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
STOP ALL THE CUTESY STUFF

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
AND START TALKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT

664
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
FROM YOUR TOILET PAPER.

665
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT CLEAN.

666
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
FEELING CLEAN IS SO IMPORTANT.

667
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
QUILTED NORTHERN SOFT AND STRONG

668

QUILTED NORTHERN
SOFT AND STRONG,

CLEAN OR YOUR MONEY BACK.

674
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
with something heart healthy
and delicious?

675
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You're a talking bee...

676
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Honey Nut Cheerios
has whole grain oats

677
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that can help
lower cholesterol.

678
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and it tastes good?

679
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000

Be happy. Be healthy.

688
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
PERLMUTTER WAS GIVING ME
THE RUNDOWN

689
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ON RYAN AND ESPOSITO'S
MUGGING CASE

690
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WHEN A CERTAIN FORENSIC DETAIL
POPPED OUT AT ME.
ORTHO WHAT NOW? ACID.?

691
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
IT'S THE FANCY TERM
FOR SALTWATER COMPOUND.

692
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THAT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC.
TRUE.

693
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
BUT WE IDENTIFIED THE DIATOMS
IN THE SAMPLE AS WELL,

694
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
WHICH MAKEIFIC.

695
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
IT NARROWS IT DOWN
TO A SINGLE BODY OF WATER.

696
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
OH, SO OUR GUY TOOK A SWIM?
NOT QUITE.
IT WAS ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS.

697
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BUT WE FOUND ORTHOSILICIC ACID
WITH THE EXACT SAME DIATOMS

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
ON ASHLEY COSWAY AS WELL.

699
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
BOTH VICTIMS HAD CONTACT
WITH THE SAME BODY OF WATER?

700
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
DIRECT CONTACT.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

701
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
IT'D BE LIKE FINDING THE SAME
FINGERPRINT ON BOTH BODIES.
DO WE KNOW
WHAT BODY OF WATER?

702
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
NO, I WOULD NEED A SAMPLE
TO TEST IT AGAINST.

703
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
CASTLE.

704
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
COULD IT BE
A SMALL BODY OF WATER?
SURE, AS LONG
AS IT'S SALTWATER.

705
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
(papers rustling)

706
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
DR. COSWAY'S FISH TANK.
CHECK OUT NEMO.

707
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
CLOWN FISH
NEED SALTWATER TO LIVE.
OKAY, BUT HOW DID THIS GET
ON BOTH OF OUR VICS?

708
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WOULDN'T THEY HAVE HAD TO

709
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
STICK THEIR HANDS IN THERE
O

710
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
YOU SEE THAT SALT ENCRUSTATION
ALONG THE TOP?
YEAH.

711
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THE PUMP JUST KICKS IT
INTO THE AIR.

712
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
YEAH, ANYONE WHO SPENT TIME
IN THAT OFFICE

713
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
WOULD HAVE TRACE AMOUNTS

714
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OF THAT TANK-SPECIFIC
SALTWATER COMPOUND ON THEM.

715
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SO THEN FRANK HAD TO
HAVE BEEN IN ASHLEY'S OFFICE

716
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SOMETIME BEFORE
HE WAS MURDERED.
IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT REMEMBER,
ASHLEY WAS MURDERED FIRST.

717
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THEN OUR PERP WAS IN THERE.

718
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THAT'S WHERE HE GOT
THE COMPOUND ON HIM.

719
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THEN HE TRANSFERRED IT
TO FRANK

720
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
WHEN HE TOOK HIS WATCH
AND WALLET.
WHICH MEANS BOTH OF OUR VICS
WERE KILLED BY THE SAME PERSON.

721
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I THOUGHT
DAD WAS MUGGED.
YEAH, LIKE--LIKE RANDOMLY.

722
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WE DON'T BELIEVE
IT WAS RANDOM ANYMORE.

723
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
MR. COSWAY'S WIFE ASHLEY
WAS KILLED EARLIER THAT NIGHT.

724
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
WE THINK THE SAME PERSON
KILLED YOUR FATHER

725
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
AND THEN TRIED TO STAGE IT

726
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
AS IF THERE WERE
TWO ISOLATED INCIDENTS.

727
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
A CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM.

728
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
THIS IS MRS. COSWAY.

729
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
AND THIS IS MR. ANDERSON.

730
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
DO EITHER OF THEM
LOOK FAMILIAR?

731
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
NO. (sighs) NOT AT ALL.
I'M SORRY.

732
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
MRS. COSWAY
WAS A THERAP

733
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
DID YOUR FATHER
EVER GO TO THERAPY?

734
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
DAD? NO. (ch

735

ANY OF T

740
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I-I DON'T THINK SO.

741
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
NO.
NO, I...

742
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
TAKE YOUR TIME.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THERE'S A CONNECTION HERE?

743
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I MEAN, WE--WE LIVE IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY,

744
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
WE'RE...

WE WORK AT DIFFERENT PLACES,

WE'RE BLACK AND YOU'RE WHITE.

NO, I--NO, I'M JUST SAYING,
WE'RE DIFFERENT.

747
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
THAT'S ALL I WAS SAYING.
THEY MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY
WITNESSED SOMETHING

748
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
OR BEEN PRIVY

749
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TO SOME INFORMATION
THAT SOMEONE VERY POWERFUL

750
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WANTED TO KEEP UNDER WRAPS.
THERE ARE ANY NUMBER
OF POSSIBILITIES.

751
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WE JUST WANT--
(Christina) GROVNER.

752
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
WHAT WAS THAT?

753
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
UH, THIS NAME--GROVNER.
IT--IT KINDA RINGS A BELL.

754
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT FIVE YEARS BACK,

755
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
GOT INVOLVED.
SOME KID'S DAD
I THINK HIS NAME WAS GROVNER.V.

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WE'LL GET A WARRANT
FOR HIS PATIENT FILE.

757
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
IF THERE'S A CONNECTION,
WE'LL FIND IT.

758
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
SO... THE PRINCIPAL
AT I.S. 1-6-1

759
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
SAID THAT GROVNER
ASSAULTED YOUR VIC

760
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
AFTER MR. ANDERSONBUSE.
WHICH IS WHSUSPICION OY

761
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
GROVNER AND HIS WIFE
WENT TO COUPLES' COUNSELING.

762
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T GO
TOO WELL,

763
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
BECAUSE THEY ENDED UP FILING
FOR DIVORCE, AND GET THIS--

764
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
MRS. COSWAY TESTIFIED
AGAINST GROVNER IN COURT.

765
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SO GROVNER HAD REASON
TO GO AFTER BOTH OUR VICTIMS.

766
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
YEAH, WENT AWAY FOR FIVE YEARS
FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE.

767
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
