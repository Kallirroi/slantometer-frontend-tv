THRONE SAYING BE HOLD THE

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WILL BE HIS PEOPLE AND GOD

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
HIMSELF WILL BE WITH THEM AS

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THEIR GOD.

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
HE WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
FROM THEIR EYES AND DEATH SHALL

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
BE NO MORE.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
NEITHER SHALL THERE BE MOURNING

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
FOR THE FORMER THINGS HAVE

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PASSED AWAY.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HE WHO WAS SEATED ON THE THRONE

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SAID, BEHOLD I AM MAKING ALL

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THINGS NEW.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
NOW MAY THE GRACE OF OUR LORD

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SEAT UNTIL I CAN RECEIVE

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CONFIRMATION THE PRESIDENT HAS

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SAFELY EXITED THE SCHOOL CAMPUS.

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CONFIRMATION IS.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> THAT IS THE INTERFAITH VIGIL.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
ROB MORRIS OF KING LUTHERAN

LEFT SIDE.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THE PASTOR ACTUALLY OF THE

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN AN INTERVIEW

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HE IS GOING TO HAVE 7 FUNERALS

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS WHO HE

TOMORROW.
THE MONSIGNOR.

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AS ARE MANY OF THOSE PLACES OF

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
WORSHIP.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THIS WRAPS UP THIS VIGIL AS YOU

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
PUSH IN A THE 26TH CANDLES.

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ED, YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
PRESIDENT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
WASN'T GOING TO BE A POLICY

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ABOUT HEALING IN THIS TOWN.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
CLEARLY THERE WAS A MESSAGE HERE

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THAT THE NATION IS NOT DOING

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ENOUGH TO KEEP KIDS SAFE WHILE

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
IT WASN'T SPECIFIC IN THE POLICY

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
PRESCRIPTIONS IT WAS SUGGESTED.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> IT CERTAINLY WAS.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I WENT BACK TO MY NOTES ONE

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
ADVISOR TOLD ME BEFORE THE

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SPEECH IS THAT IT WAS NOT A

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
POLICY SYMPOSIUM THAT IT WAS

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
GOING TO BE A SPEECH THAT WAS

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
GOING TO BE CONDUCIVE TO THE

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
VENUE OF A PRAYER VIGIL.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
YOU ARE RIGHT.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THERE WASN'T ANY SPECIFIC POLICY

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
PROPOSAL.
THERE WAS NEVER THE WORDS GUN

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
CONTROL UTTERED.

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THERE WAS NEVER ASSAULT WEAPONS

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
BAN OR ANYTHING SPECIFIC LIKE

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THAT.
MAKE NO MISTAKE HE WAS REFERRING

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SPECIFICALLY TO THE IDEA IN THE

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WEEKS AHEAD HE WOULD BE TALKING

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OTHERS ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TO BETTER PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY WE ARE

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TOO POWERLESS TO DO SOMETHING.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
AND THERE WEREN'T SPECIFIC

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
POLICY PROPOSALS.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
HE MADE IT QUITE CLEAR IN THE

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WEEKS AHEAD HE IS PLANNING TO

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TAKE DRAMATIC ACTION ON THIS

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ISSUE.

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
AS YOU KNOW FROM HEARING FROM

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
MAYOR BLOOMBERG THEY ARE GOING

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
TO HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE.

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING IN THE

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DAYS AHEAD.

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TWO OTHER THINGS ONE WHEN THE

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
PRESIDENT WAS READING THE NAMES

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
AGED THE REPORTERS ARE SAYING

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THEY HEARD WEEPING AND HEAVEING

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
FROM ADULTS WHO ARE HEARING

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THOSE CHILDREN'S NAMES THAT IS

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SOMETHING THAT STICKS WITH YOU.

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WHEN HE INTRODUCED TO THE

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
PRESIDENT HE TOLD THE GOVERNOR

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THAT FRIDAY WAS THE TOUGHEST DAY

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I HAVE COVERED HIM FOR FOUR

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
YEARS NOW THINK BACK TO THE WAR

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE FINANCIAL

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
CRISIS DEPLETED THEIR FINANCES

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
AND THEY HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
UNEMPLOYED ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
TUCSON, AURORA, WISCONSIN, MANY

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OTHER SHOOTINGS.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THE FACT THAT HE SAID FRIDAY WAS

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE WORST DAY OF HIS PRESIDENCY

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TELLS YOU THE DEPTH OF THIS

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> AND HENRY, THANK YOU.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
IT WAS A POWERFUL SPEECH.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
LET'S BRING BACK OUR PANEL STEVE

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
HAYES, CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
>> CHARLES YOUR THOUGHTS?

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
>> THAT WAS A HIGHLY POLITICAL

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
SPEECH.
THE BOOK ENDS WERE SIMPLICITY

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ITSELF ELEGANT GIVEN HIS

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
UNDERSTANDING OF THE GRIEF AND

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SORT OF EXTENDING HIS

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY AND

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE NATION.
THE MIDDLE PART OF THAT SPEECH

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WAS A DETERMINATION OF THIS

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
PRESIDE

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
PRESIDENT>> HE WROTE A LOT OF

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THIS ON HIS OWN.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
INTERAGENCY CONSIDERATION THIS

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
IS HIS COMMITMENT.

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
IT SOUNDED LIKE HE'S GOING TO DO

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
SOMETHING.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE LBJ AFTER

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
KENNEDY IS KILLED AND HE SAID I

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AM GOING TO BE THE CIVIL RIGHTS

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I AM GOING TO COMPLETE THE CIVIL

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
RIGHTS.
I HOPE IT ISN'T ONLY ABOUT GUN

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
CONTROL BUT I THINK HE WAS

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ANNOUNCING SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT WOULD

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
COME TO HIM PERSONALLY.

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF THIS

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
KARNAGE.

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WHAT WAS DISTURBING TO ME OUT OF

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THIS WHICH OTHERWISE WAS POETIC

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
SPEECH HE WAS GOING TO ACT

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
UNILATER

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
UNILATERALLY.

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MAY BE WRONG THERE WEREN'T A LOT
OF DETAILS IN THERE BUT THE

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
ENERGY WILL COME OUT OF THE

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WHITE HOUSE.

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
UNITE THIS COUNTRY AROUND THIS

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
RATHER THAN DIVIDE THE COUNTRY

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THESE ARE EXPLOSIVE ISSUES WE

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OF THE

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HEATED WATERS AND PUT IT IN

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
CONSIDERATION YOU HAVE TO BRING

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
PARTIES TO THE TABLE THAT AREN'T

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
JUST THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT FROM THE GET

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
GO.
>> ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OUR CHILDREN SAFE.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THE ANSWER IS NO.

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I WILL BE INTERESTED TO FIND OUR

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR THE SPEECH.

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IT IS POSSIBLE ED HENRY SEES IT

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ONE THING AND SAW FAMILIES AND

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HEARD FROM THEM MAYBE THIS WAS

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THE TYPE OF THING THEY WANTED TO

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HEAR.
MAYBE THEY WANTED THE PRESIDENT

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
TO STEP UP AND SAY ENOUGH IS

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ENOUGH.
WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS ANY

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MORE.

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I DIDN'T TAKE AWAY HE WAS GOING

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
TO ACT UNILATERALLY.

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
HE DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE JUST

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ON GUNS OR MENTAL ILLNESS.

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
>> I THINK IT IS A TURNING

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
POINT.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
HE MADE UNMISTAKABLY CLEAR WE

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE WE CAN'T

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
TOLERATE THIS ANY MORE THE

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
TRAGEDIES MUST END.

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THOSE ARE NOT THINGS YOU CAN'T

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
GO BACK FROM.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
YOU HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD.

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I THOUGHT HE SPOKE EFFECTIVELY

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
FIRST AS A FATHER AND THEN AS A

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
LEADER.
I SUSPECT I WON'T AGREE WITH

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SOME OF HIS POLICY BUT IT WAS AN

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
EFFECTIVE POWERFUL SPEECH.

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> IT WAS POWERFUL.

269
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
IT WAS A POWERFUL TIME TO HEAR

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE KID'S NAMES READ AT THE END

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND THE SOBBING IN THAT ROOM.

272
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
JUST WRAPPED IT UP.

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THAT CONCLUDES FOX NEWS CHANNEL

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000

HIM?
>> I BELIEVE I FIRST MET HIM

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THROUGH THE MIDDLE SCHOOL PRIOR

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
TO HIM COMING INTO THE HIGH

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
SCHOOL.
MY IMPRESSIONS OF HIM WERE VERY

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
HIGH IN THE BEGINNING.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN NOT UNLIKE

306
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OTHER YOUNG MEN BUT WITH A FEW

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
DISORDERS THAT HAD TO BE

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000

DIFFICULTY INTERACTING WITH

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
OTHER STUDENTS.

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> RICHARD, WHEN YOU SAY

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ASBERGERS IS OUT THERE, DID YOU

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
KNOW THAT AT THE TIME?

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
HOW OLD WAS HE WHEN YOU FIRST

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000

WAS SUFFERING FROM THAT ISSUE?

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
HIGH SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS COMING

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000

HE WAS PART OF THAT CLUB.

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
IT WAS A LARGE CLUB WE HAD IN

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
SCHOOL.
>> AND WHAT DID PEOPLE DO IN THE

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000

AUDIO, BUT THE CLUB ITSELF WAS

353
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WAS A PLACE TO BE LONG.

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
>> DID HE NEED THAT?

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000

>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> WELL, IT GOES BACK TO SAYING

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THAT HE WAS WITHDRAWN MOST OF

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THE TIME, HE WAS VERY QUIET.

361
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
IN HIS FRESHMAN YEAR HE WAS VERY

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
SMALL IN SIZE AND HE HAD A LOT

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
OF FEAR COMING INTO THE HIGH

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SCHOOL AND INTERACTING WITH

365
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
OTHER STUDENTS.

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
>> BUT DID HE HAVE A REASON TO

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
BE FEARFUL OF THE OTHER

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
STUDENTS?

369
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000

NOT REALLY.

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THE ADMINISTRATORS, THE

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
TEACHERS, MOST OF THE STUDENTS

377
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
USUALLY ADOPT KIDS YOUNGER THAN

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THEM.
NO, THERE WASN'T.

379
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
RICHARD DID YOU HAVE OCCASION TO

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
MEET HIS MOTHER DURING THE TIME

382
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
THAT HE WAS IN SCHOOL, NANCY

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
LANZA?
>> YES, OFTEN.

384
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
>> TELL US ABOUT HER.

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
>> SHE WAS A GREAT PERSON.

386
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I LIKED HER VERY, VERY MUCH.

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PARENT WHO

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
INTERACTED WITH HER CHILDREN,

389
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE

390
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.

391
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
FRIENDS WERE PROBABLY CHOSEN

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
WELL.
THE ACTIVITIES SHE WAS INVOLVED

393
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
IN ALL OF THE TIME.

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> HOW DID SEE AHE AND HER SON

395
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
INTERACT?
>> TOUGH TO SAY.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
QUITE WELL.
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TWOT BOYS.

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
ONE WAS OUT GOING AND  ENERGETI

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
ADAM WAS WITHDRAWN AND SHY.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
THE IDEA WAS TO INJECT HIM INTO

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE HE WOULD

402
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THRIVE AND MAYBE GROW AND COME

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OUT OF HIS WORLD.

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED WHEN YOU

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
HEARD ALL OF THIS?

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
>> SHOCKED.

407
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I AM STILL SHOCKED.

408
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
>> WHY?

409
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
>> THIS IS A BOY WHO WAS MORE

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
LIKELY A VICTIM WHICH IS WHY I

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
WOULD WATCH HIM VERY CLOSELY

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
RATHER THAN BE THE PERSON WHO

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
VICTIMIZED.

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I AM SHOCKED.

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
>> FRIDAY MORNING JUST BLEW ME

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
AWAY.
I WAS BUSY WITH WORK AND I FIST

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
RECEIVED A TEXT FROM MY OWN SON

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
WHO ATTENDED THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I REALLY I DO BELIEVE THIS COULD

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BE POSSIBLE.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THE MOM HAD

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
SO MANY GUNS?

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
>> I AM SHOCKED.

424
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I AM SURPRISED SHE HAD THAT MANY

425
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
GUNS.
CAUSED ME TO REALLY RETHINK

426
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
KEEPING ME UP AT NIGHT WONDERING

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WHY I WOULD NOT HAVE ENVISIONED

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
HER NOT ONLY TO HAVE GUNS BUT

429
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THE TYPE OF GUNS.

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
>> WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
SHARING YOUR INSIGHT ON THE

432
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER.

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
EVENING.
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE.

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
>> COMING UP TOMORROW MORNING

436
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WILL GO

437
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
BACK TO SCHOOL.

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WILL THEY EVEN BE SAFE?

439
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
CAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
AGAIN?

441
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
LATER THEY SAY TIME HEALS ALL

442
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
WOUNDS, BUT HOW LONG WILL IT

443
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
TAKE TO HEAL AFTER A TRAGEDY

444
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
LIKE THIS.

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
(INAUDIBLE)
>> TOMORROW MORNING MILLIONS OF

446
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
CHILDREN ACROSS AMERICA HEAD

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
BACK TO SCHOOL.
THEIR PARENTS ARE NOW FORCED TO

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
WONDER, IS MY CHILD SAFE?

449
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
WITH ME IS FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
AND SCHOOL SAFETY EXPERT.

451
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US,

452
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
HARRY.
WE KNOW THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

453
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SYSTEM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

454
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
PARTICULAR HAD MEASURES IN PLACE

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
FOR SAFETY, AND IT IS OBVIOUS TO

456
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
STOP THIS CRAZED INDIVIDUAL.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
HE IS EVIL.

458
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
HE DID THE DEVIL'S WORK.

459
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WHAT CAN WE DO IN SCHOOLS TO

460
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN?

461
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
>> THEY DID HAVE SOME PLAN IN

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THE SCHOOL.

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WE COULD PROBABLY TWEAK THAT,

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THOUGH.
>> HOW?

465
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
>> APPARENTLY THE SHOOTER GOT IN

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR.

467
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS HE SHOT THE

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
GLASS DOOR OUT AND WENT INSIDE.

469
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THE CLASS ITSELF WASN'T -- WAS

470
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
VERY EASILY PENETRATED.

471
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THE

472
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
SCHOOL.
SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT

473
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THINGS WE CAN DO.

474
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> WHAT?

475
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE PUT THE

476
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
BARS ON THE DOORS.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
>> PEOPLE SAY, HARRY THAT THAT'S

478
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INTIMIDATING.
YOU DON'T WANT METAL DETECTORS

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
YOU DON'T WANT A COP WITH A GUN.

480
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
NOW YOU ARE TALKING BARS.

481
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
YOU BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING WE

482
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
NEED TO DO?

483
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
>> I THINK THAT THE LOCK DOWN IS

484
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
PROBABLY THE ANSWER.

485
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> DESCRIBE A LOCK DOWN.

486
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
>> YOU DO WITH YOUR EMERGENCY

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
ACTION PLAN.

488
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
IT IS BASICALLY LOCKING DOWN THE

489
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SCHOOL WHICH THEY TRIED TO DO.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THEY LOCKED ALL OF THE DOORS.

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
>> BUT THE SHOOTER IS IN THE

492
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
SCHOOL.
RIGHT, EXACTLY.

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE SHOOTER GOT INTO THE SCHOOL.

494
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
IF THEY HAD SOME KIND OF BARS ON

495
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THAT DOOR MAYBE THE SHOOTER

496
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO THE

497
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SCHOOL.

498
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
>> SO LET'S ACCOUPLE THAT THERE

499
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
IS THIS AS YOU CALL SAFETY OR

500
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN.
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO TRAIN

501
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
THE TEACHERS AND EFSHL ELSE.

502
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
IS THIS EXPENSIVE?

503
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
WHO PAYS FOR IT IN A WORLD WHERE

504
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THE END OF THE FISCAL CLIFF, HOW

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
DIFFICULT IS IT?

506
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
>> WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS AREN'T

507
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
GOING TO PUT 50,000 DOLLARS INTO

508
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
A SECURITY UPGRADE.

509
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS EASY TO

510
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
DO.
IT IS A LITTLE SCHOOLING.

511
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
YOU CAN BASICALLY GET A HANDYMAN

512
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
TO DO SOME OF THE WORK TO THE

513
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WINDOWS AND TO THE DOORS AND YOU

514
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
WILL HAVE A HE CSECURE SCHOOL.

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOME

516
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
TYPE OF AN ALARM WHERE THEY KNOW

517
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
IT IS TIME FOR THE LOCK DOWN.

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
>> EVERYBODY HEARD WHAT WAS

519
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
GOING ON.

520
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
>> WHAT SHOULD PARENTS DO

521
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
TOMORROW MORNING SHOULD THEY

522
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
CALL THEIR SCHOOL AND SAY HEY

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WHAT IS THE SAFETY PLAN FOR MY

524
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
CHILD?
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THEY SHOULD

525
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
DEFINITELY DO.

526
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I SUGGEST PARENTS CALL THE

527
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SCHOOL AND ASK THEM DO YOU HAVE

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN

529
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
EFFECT IN THE SCHOOL?

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
IF NOT, WHY?

531
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AND IF NOT, WHEN?

532
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
GET TOGETHER WITH THE PTA, THEN

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
YOU CAN ALL GET TOGETHER TALK

534
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WITH THE SCHOOL OFF FIFSH SHALLS

535
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
AND POLICE AND PUT AN EMERGENCY

536
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ACTION PLAN TOGETHER.

537
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
LOCK DOWN IS VERY COST

538
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
EFFECTIVE.
>> WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN?

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

540
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THE DRILLS THESE CHILDREN

541
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
BEFORE, I USE TO DO HIDE UNDER

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THE DESK.

543
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
MY KIDS WILL SAY THAT'S WHERE

544
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THEY WERE WRITTEN ON THE SILK

545
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
TABLETS.
TODAY THE DRILL IS

546
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
SIMPLY TO GO OUT OF THE SCHOOL?

547
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
HOW DO YOU PREPARE LITTLE KIDS

548
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
WITHOUT SCARING THEM?

549
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
>> FOR AN ACTIVE SHOOTER YOU

550
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
DON'T WANT THE KIDS RUNNING OUT

551
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
OF SCHOOL.

552
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THEY CAN RUN INTO THE ACTIVE

553
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
SHOOTER.

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOCK DOWN

555
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THE CLASSROOM.

556
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IF YOU CAN LOCK DOWN THE

557
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
CLASSROOM, GET THE CHILDREN DOWN

558
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ON THE FLOOR, TAKE THEIR DESKS

559
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000

WILL SHE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED

740
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
SURVIVOR'S GUILT?

741
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS TO

742
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN LIFE.

743
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHY CHILDRERTAIN E

744
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
SURVIVE AND CERTAIN PEOPLE

745
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
DON'T.

746
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PERHAPS HER ROLE CAN BE IN

747
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
TRYING TO MAKE THIS A POSITIVE

748
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
FOR HERSELF.

749
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
GIVE HER BROTHER'S LIFE SOME

750
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
MEANING.
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE SHE WILL END UP

751
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
BEING A DEFENSE ATTORNEY ONE

752
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
DAY.
>> MAYBE A PROSECUTOR.

753
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
>> I TACHANGE MY STATEMENT.

754
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
>> DOCTOR, YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR

755
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WITH THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHO

756
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
BASICALLY REFUSES TO BE CAUGHT

757
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
IN A TRAP OF LABELLING THESE

758
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE KILLING UNDER THE

759
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
GOOIDZ OF A MENTAL ILLNESS.

760
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
>> THE TALK ABOUT AUTISM AND THE

761
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
SHOOTER LACKING SOCIAL SKILLS.

762
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
DO YOU REALIZE EVERY ONE OF

763
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THESE SHOOTERS HAS BEEN

764
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
DESCRIBED AS A LOANER AND WITH

765
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
DRAWN.
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

766
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

767
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
DON'T WANT OTHERS TO KNOW THEM.

768
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

769
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
SECRETIVE.

770
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT

771
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
GOING ON IN THEIR MINDS THAT

772
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THEY WILL NOT ANNOUNCE TO

773
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OTHERS.

774
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE SOCIAL

775
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SKILLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE

776
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
ABOUT SOCIAL SKILLS.

777
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
THEIR VIEW OF LIFE IS THEY ARE

778
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
THE HUB OF THE WHEEL EVERYTHING

779
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
MUST REVOLVE AROUND IT.

780
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
WE PUT LABELS ON TRYING TO

781
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
EXPLAIN THE UNEXPLAINABLE AND

782
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THERE BY CREATE MORE EXCUSES.

783
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
>> DOCTOR AS SOMEONE WHO TRIED A

784
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
LOT OF CRIMINAL CASES MURDER

785
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
CHASES INSANITY DEFENSES I NEVER

786
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THOUGHT THE ISSUE OF INSANITY

787
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WHICH PEOPLE WILL SURELY COME

788
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
UPON IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS IT

789
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
RELATES TO THIS CASE HAS

790
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT OF

791
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WHAT WAS DONE.
AND SO THE LABELLING OF

792
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
ASPERGER'S WHICH I HAVE SEEN IT

793
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
USED IN OTHER HOMICIDE CASES IS

794
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ALMOST AN EXCUSE.

795
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
PEOPLE SAY OH BUT HE WAS SMART.

796
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
THAT'S ALMOST AN EXCUSE AS WELL.

797
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
>> THE FACT THAT THE PERPETRATOR

798
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WAS SMART MAKES FOR A WONDER RL

799
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
COVER.
IF YOU ARE SMART, A BRAINIAC I

800
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
BELIEVE HE WAS CALLED THAT MAKES

801
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
IT EASIER TO GET A PASS FOR

802
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
OTHERS TO FOCUS ON HOW BRIGHT

803
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THE PERSON IS.

804
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAID TO ME

805
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
TO KILL SOMEBODY YOU HAVE TO BE

806
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
INSANE.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACTS OF

807
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THE CASE.

808
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
HOW THE SHOOTINGS WERE COMMITTED

809
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HOW PURPOSEFUL, HOW RATIONAL AND

810
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
DELIBERATE BRAT THEY WERE.

811
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
>> SPINNING OFF OF IT YOU HAVE A

812
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
GUY WHO SHOOTS HIS OWN MOTHER IN

813
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THE FACE, SHOOTS HER FOUR TIMES.

814
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WHAT IS HE SO ANGRY ABOUT?

815
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

816
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
BUT CLEARLY THERE WAS A

817
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

818
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HIM AND HIS MOTHER.

819
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>> WE HEARD ABOUT FROM THE

820
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
TEACHER, I BELIEVE FOUR YEARS

821
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
BACK MAYBE THREE YEARS BACK IS

822
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THE MOTHER CARED ABOUT HIM AND

823
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
CARED ABOUT HIM.

824
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> SHE MAY HAVE.

825
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

826
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A CHILD CAN

827
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
BE VERY CONFLICTED.

828
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
PERHAPS HER SON GOT WORSE AS

829
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
TIME WENT ON.

830
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

831
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR SOME REASON

832
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THEY WERE TOO ISOLATED THAT THE

833
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
MOTHER AND SON HAD TOO MUCH TIME

834
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
TOGETHER.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OUTSIDE

835
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
INTERVENTION SHE ASKED FOR.

836
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SOUNDS LIKE SHE HOME SCHOOLED

837
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
HIM.
>> I HAVE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE

838
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
WE GO TO BREAK.

839
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THE IDEA OF A MOTHER KNOWING HER

840
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SON HAD PROBLEMS AND THEN TAKING

841
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
HIM TO A GUN RANGE, HAVING THESE

842
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
HIGH POWERED WEAPONS AND CLIPS

843
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
OBVIOUSLY.

844
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
A GLOCK AND A BUSHMASTER WHICH

845
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IS LIKE AN AR 15 ASSAULT RIFLE.

846
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?

847
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A

848
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
PH.D. TO SAY IT DOESN'T SOUND

849
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

850
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
EVEN IF SHE SOUGHT HELP FOR HIM,

851
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE DID OR NOT.

852
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
IT'S HARD TO GET HELP FOR A KID

853
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
LIKE THIS, TO DE CATAIN A KID T

854

855
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
VERY HARD IN THE YEAR 2012 TO DO

856
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THAT.

857
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000

HOW CAN A PARENT POSSIBLY HEAL

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
FROM SUCH A TRAUMATIC EVENT.

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
LATER THE ROLE OF RELIGION AND

So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

903
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

904
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's not real.

905
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

906
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000

coffee tastes dreadful.

PARENTS BAUURYING THEIR CHILDRE.

926
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
IT'S COUNTER INDUE TIVE THAT'S

927
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER WAY.

928
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
>> WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY FEEL

929
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THEM.

930
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE FOR A

931
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
PARENT TO GO THROUGH.

932
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
AND AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU ARE

933
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
SEEING THESE PARENTS ARE IN

934
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
SHOCK, THEY ARE NUMB, THEY ARE

935
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OVERWHELMED WITH THEIR FEELINGS.

936
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THEY MAY NOT EVEN FEEL THEIR

937
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
FEELINGS.

938
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THEY HAVE BEEN ALMOST

939
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
DISASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

940
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
FEELINGS.

941
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
YOU TALK TO PEOPLE AT THIS STAGE

942
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
AND THEY WILL TELL YOU LIKE THEY

943
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
ARE GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS

944
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
AND THEY ARE LIKE A ROBOT.

945
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
ACTUALLY SOMETIMES IT'S THE

946
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
PEOPLE AROUND THEM THAT ARE

947
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
LITERALLY KIND OF CARRYING

948
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THROUGH THESE VERY DIFFICULT

949
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
STEPS.

950
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
>> HOW DO THEY COME OUT OF IT?

951
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WHEN DO YOU GET OUT FROM UNDER

952
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE CLOUD?
YOU HAVE OTHER CHILDREN AT HOME.

953
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE SUFFERING AS

954
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WELL.
>> SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT BRINGS

955
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
YOU AT LEAST INTO LIVING.

956
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY BRING YOU

957
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
INTO A FULL HAPPY LIFE BECAUSE

958
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
THERE'S A WHOLE THAT REALLY

959
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
DOESN'T GET FILLED BUT WHAT THEY

960
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
DO IS FIND A WAY EVENTUALLY IF

961
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THEY CAN TO HAVE THEIR GRIEF

962
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
TRACK IN THEIR LIFE AND THEN THE

963
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
LIVING TRACK OF THEIR LIFE.

964
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
AND THEY SOMETIME HAVE TO KEEP A

965
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
FOOT IN BOTH WORLDS AND

966
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
EVENTUALLY THE LIVING PART CAN

967
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
GET BIGGER.

968
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
>> YOU DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

969
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
YOU RECOMMEND THE PARENTS WHO

970
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ARE BURYING THEIR CHILDREN THAT

971
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THEY GET COUNSELING, STAY IN

972
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
TOUCH AND NOT BE WITHDRAWN AND

973
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WHAT ELSE?

974
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT YOU SEE

975
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
OVER TIME IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS

976
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
A DIFFERENT REACTION.

977
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THERE AREN'T STAGES OF GRIEF.

978
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
IT IS THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE.

979
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
IT INVOLVES STAGES.

980
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
AT A CERTAIN TIME YOUR FRIENDS

981
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
CHILDREN ARE GRADUATING FROM

982
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
HIGH SCHOOL AND YOURS AREN'T.

983
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
YOU START TO PAY ATTENTION TO

984
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
HOW YOU ARE DOING.

985
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER WHO

986
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
NEED SPECIFIC HELP TO HELP THEM

987
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
LEARN HOW TO COPE AND ACTUALLY

988
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH AND

989
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
FIND SOME KIND OF MEANING AND

990
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
NEW PEOPLE IN THEIR LIFE.

991
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
>> THEY TALK ABOUT POST

992
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME IN

993
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
WARS.

994
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THESE KIDS HAVE SEEN HELL A LOT

995
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
OF THEM.

996
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
>> THEY WERE IN A MINI WAR WHEN

997
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

998
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THE RAMPAGE.

999
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000

DISORDER IS HAVING OO FRIGHTENE.

1005

WE USUALLY WALK AROUND THINKING

1006
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
WE ARE SAFE AND THE WORLD IS

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
SAFE.
THERE IS A RECOGNITION THE WORLD

1008
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
IS NO LONGER SAFE OR IN YOUR

1009
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
CONTROL.

1011
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
FATHER LEAVE HER SIDE FOR GOOD

1012
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
REASONS.

NIGHTMARES SOMETIMES PANIC

1014
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
ATTACKS.
FEAR TO GO NEAR THE SCHOOL, TO

1015
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
BE SEPARATED FROM A PARENT.

1016
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
MAYBE TO HAVE SLEEP OVERS.

1017
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SO PARENTS CAN JUST BE AWARE OF

1018
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THIS WORK WITH THEIR

1019
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
PEDIATRICIAN.
SOUNDS LIKE THE TOWN IS REALLY

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
HELPING OUT AND BEING A RESOURCE

1021
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

1022
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
>> THE QUESTION THAT -- THE

1023
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
BIGGER QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE

SO YOU KEEP REACHING OUT SO

1032
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THESE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL ALONE.

1033

>> THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT

1034
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
EVERYONE IN THAT TOWN WAS

1035
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
AFFECTED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

1036
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
HOW HARD IS IT TO IDENTIFY ONE

1037
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
WHO MIGHT COMMIT A CRIME LIKE

1038
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THIS?
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT

1039
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE LIKE

1040
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
LITTLE TERRORISTS OR BIG

1041
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
TERRORISTS.
THEY LIVE IN THEIR FAMILIES AND

1042
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THEIR PARENTS AND OTHERS SPOUSES

1043
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
AND ADULTS THEY ARE AFRAID OF

1044
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THEM.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET PEOPLE

1045
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
LIKE THIS TO STAY IN HELL TO

1046
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
DETAIN THEM.

POSITION.

1050
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
THERE MIGHT BE A PRAYER BUT

1051
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE EVIL ARE NOT

1052
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
AMENABLE TO MENTAL HEALTH

1053

US TODAY.

1143
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I GUESS THE QUESTION WE ALL ASK

1144
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
IS AN ALL KNOWING POWERFUL

1145
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
LOVING GOD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

1146
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
>> THE WAY I LOOK AT THE

1147
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
QUESTION IS, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

1148
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE WITHOUT

1149
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
GOD THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.

1150
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THIS MAN TURNED AWAY FROM GOD

1151
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
OBVIOUSLY AND DID SOMETHING

1152
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
TREMENDOUS.

1153
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
KILLING YOUR OWN MOTHER AND

1154
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
KILLING INNOCENT CHILDREN SO

1155
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
AGAINST NATURE COMPLETELY

1156
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
AGAINST THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

1157
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
GOD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

1158
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE FREE

1159
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
CHOICES.

1160
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I NOTICE THAT PUBLIC REACTION IS

1161
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
NOT TO TURN AWAY FROM GOD AND

1162
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
BLAME HIM.

1163
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
IT'S TO GO TO GOD AND PRAY FOR

1164
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
SYMPATHY AND THE VICTIMS AND

1165
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
CONSTELLATION.

1166
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> YOU KNOW FATHER CAN YOU

ANGEL AND WILL BE BURYING THESE

1169
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
CHILDREN THIS WEEK CAN TURN AWAY

1170
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
AND SAY, HOW COULD GOD TAKE MY

1171
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
CHILD FROM ME?

1172
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>>> OO GOD DIDN'T DO IT.

1173
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THE MESSAGE WE SAY IS GOD LOVES

1174
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THAT CHILD.

1175
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THAT'S THE HOPE OF CHRISTIANITY.

1176
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
JESUS HAVING HIS LITTLE ONES.

1177
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THE ANSWER IS MORE COMPLICATED

1178
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THAN SOMEBODY MIGHT LIKE.

1179
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
WE NEVER KNOW WHEN THE CALL IS

1180
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
GOING TO COME.
THIS IS HORRIBLE IT SHOULDN'T

1181
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
HAPPEN.

1182
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A PROOF

1183
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WE HAVE TO FIGHT EVIL NOT

1184
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
TOLERATE IT.

1185
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
>> I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOLS

1186
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AND I AM A CATHOLIC.

1187
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I STAUND WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN FREE

1188
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
WILL, BUT YOU KNOW THE ABILITY

1189
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

1190
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
STILL -- IT ALLOWS THOSE OTHER

1191
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
PEOPLE TO CHOOSE EVIL.

1192
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN'T STOP.

1193
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
>> WE CAN OFFER ANOTHER LAW, A

1194
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
LAW OF LOVE AND TRAINING IN

1195
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
SYMPATHY.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO READ

1196
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
WHAT PART RELIGION PLAYED IN HIS

1197
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000

HE SAID, I AM NOT ANGRY.

DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

1205
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT BEFORE?

1206
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
>> I HAVE.
AS WE RESPOND TO DISASTERS.

1207
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WE MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

1208
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
FOUNDATION OF FAITH.

1209
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
A FAITH IN CHRIST.

1210

WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

1211
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
FOUNDATION OF FAITH AT ALL.

1212
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
IT IS A TESTIMONY OF WHAT GODS

1213
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
HAS DONE IN SOMEONE'S LIFE THAT

1214
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
IS FOUNDATIONAL.

1215
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THEY HAVE A FAITH IN CHRIST.

1216
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
THEY KNOW THAT IS THEIR SOURCE

1217
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
OF HOPE, THEIR SOURCE OF COMFORT

1218
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
AND WHEN THEY DO TURN TO CHRIST

1219
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
AND TO GOD'S WORD THAT OFFERS

1220
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THAT HOPE THEY ARE THE ONES.

1221
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
NOT TO SAY THEY DON'T HURT, THEY

1222
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
DON'T SUFFER, IT'S STILL AN

1223
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
AGONIZING LOSS FOR THEM.

1224
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY ONE ELSE.

1225
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
IT LOOKS LIKE A REALITY WHEN YOU

1226
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
HAVE A FAITH IN CHRIST AND YOU

1227
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
CAN PUT YOUR COMPETENCE IN HIM

1228
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000

1284
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
UNTIL I HAD THE SHINGLES.
I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
SUCH A BURNING SENSATION...

1285
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
IT WAS LIKE A RED RASH.

1286
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
LIKE SOMEBODY HAD SET A BAG
OF HOT CHARCOAL ON MY NECK.

1287
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I HAD NO IDEA IT
CAME FROM CHICKENPOX.

1288
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
IT'S SOMETHING YOU
NEVER WANT TO ENCOUNTER.
