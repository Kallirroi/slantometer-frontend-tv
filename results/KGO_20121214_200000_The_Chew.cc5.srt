IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SHOULD I BE PINCHED TO SEE IF IT

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
IT'S HEART WRENCHING.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000

BUILDING BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THERE ARE PARENTS WHO DO NOT

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HAVE THAT LUXURY OF KNOWING

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WHETHER THEIR CHILD IS OKAY.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEIR

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000

THIS AFTERNOON.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000

WE ALL KNOW, THEY HAD TAKEN

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
PRECAUTIONS TO MAKE IT SAFER.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000

TODAY ONLY HE'LL HAVE TO DO IT

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
IN FRONT OF THE NATION.

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000

INSTINCTS AS A FATHER KICK IN AS

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
NO MATTER WHAT JOB WE HAVE, OUR

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
FIRST INSTINCT IS TO REACT AS A

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
PARENT, I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THE NEWS BEFORE US MANY OF US

219
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
IT DOES INFORM HOW HE SEEKS TO

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
CONSOLE THE NATION AND HOW HE

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000

ESPECIALLY SPEAKING TO THE

ROOM.

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THIS UNFOLDED TODAY.

232
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE THE

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WORST SHOOTING AT AN ELEMENTARY

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES.

235
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000

THESE ARE THE IMAGES FROM

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
IT'S SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SCHOOL.
IT'S BEEN FLASHED ACROSS SCREENS

245
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ACROSS THE NATION.

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT THEREABOUT

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
500 ATTEND THE SCHOOL.

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
THIS MOTHER DISTRAUGHT.

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THERE WERE MANY, MANY REUNIONS.

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WE KNOW THAT THIS AFTERNOON,

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THERE ARE MANY PARENTS WHO HAVE

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BEEN BRIEFED BY THE GOVERNOR

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THERE IN CONNECTICUT.

254
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
MANY OF THEM LEAVING THE SCHOOL

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
DISTRAUGHT AND WITHOUT ANY

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
CHILDREN BY THEIR SIDE AS DAN

257
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HARRIS REPORTED MOMENTS AGO.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
DIFFICULT OF REPORTING THIS

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
STORY OUT.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IT'S TO WATCH AS THIS UNFOLDS IN

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A TINY PICTURESQUE NEW ENGLAND

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
TOWN ON A SUNNY FRIDAY MORNING.

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN FINISHING THEIR

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WEEK AND AS WE ALL KNOW, IF WE

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
HAVE CHILDREN IN OUR LIVES THAT

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THE COUNTDOWN IS ON.

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
MANY MARKING HANNUKAH.

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THEY WERE APPROACHING THE END OF

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WHAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WEEK OF

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
TWO OF SCHOOL BEFORE THEY WERE

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HEAD HOME FOR THE HOLIDAY.

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
WAIT FOR SANTA'S ARRIVAL.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
AND MARK THE NEW YEAR WITH THEIR

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
PARENTS BEFORE HEADING BACK TO

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SCHOOL.
THAT STORY FROM THAT FIRST GRADE

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TEACHER AND THERE WILL BE MANY

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
MORE OF THESE STORIES.

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I LOCKED MY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN

280
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THE BATHROOM AND I TRIED TO

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
REMAIN POSITIVE.

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ONE OF THEM SAID I JUST WANT

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
CHRISTMAS.

284
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
BOY, THOSE CHILDREN WHO WALKED

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000

EVERYTHING BEHIND, AS I

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
MENTIONED.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN WITH

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
US, I TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
BUT THEY WERE TOLD WE NEED TO

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
LEAVE AND LEAVE ALL YOUR THINGS

294
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PART OF THIS COUNTRY.

MANY OF THEM HOLDING HANDS, AND

298
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE REACTION FROM THOSE TEACHERS

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
WHO LOOKED INTENT ON GETTING

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THEIR CHILDREN OUT, CALM, BUT

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
YOU COULD SEE THE ANXIETY ON

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THEIR FACES, AND WE'VE HEARD IT

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
AS THE DAY HAS UNFOLDED, HOW

304
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
COULD IT HAVE POSSIBLY HAPPENED

305
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
HERE.

306
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU FROM

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

CHILDREN AND DID NOT FIND THEIR

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
AND HE'S EXPECTED TO SPEAK,

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
ALSO, WITHIN THE HOUR.

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
3:30 WAS THE TIME GIVEN TO US.

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BUT AS WE KNOW, WE'RE HARDLY

324
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
KEEPING TO IT ON A DAY LIKE

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
RAW EMOTION THAT FOLLOWS SUCH AN

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ENORMOUS TRAGEDY.

ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
SOMEONE INSIDE THAT SCHOOL?

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> -- SHOOTER THAT HIS MOTHER

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000

SCHOOL.

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
AND THAT SOME OF HER STUDENTS

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
MAY HAVE BEEN TARGETED.

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
>> PIERRE, WE BELIEVE THAT SHE

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000

>> YES.

343
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000

OTHER PART OF THIS

345
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
INVESTIGATION?
THAT IT MIGHT NOT JUST BE THE

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SCHOOL THEY'RE LOOKING AT AT

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
GOING FORWARD.

360
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000

DAUGHTER HAD CALLED HIM TO SAY

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
SHE HAD HEARD WHAT HAPPENED AND

371
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SHE DESCRIBED HIM AS A QUIET,

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
KIND OF KID.

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
SEEMED TO GET SORT OF LOST IN

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
THE SHUFFLE.

375
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AND, OF COURSE, THAT'S JUST ONE

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
TINY PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE.

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
IT'S SORT OF THE FIRST LITTLE

378
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WINDOW WE HAVE TO THIS

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
24-YEAR-OLD.

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE

381
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
COULD HAVE BEEN THOUGH AS PIERRE

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
JUST REPORTED HE DID ENTER THAT

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SCHOOL KNOWING THAT HIS MOTHER

384
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
WAS INSIDE.

385
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
HAD BEGUN HER SCHOOL DAY.

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
AS A TEACHER THERE AT THAT

387
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CONNECTICUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

388
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST 27 HAVE

389
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
BEEN SHOT AND KILLED, AND THIS

390
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
MORNING, JUST WATCHING THAT

391
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
NUMBER INCREASE, WAS FRIGHTENING

392
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THING FOR MANY PEOPLE ACROSS

393
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
THIS COUNTRY AS THEY WERE TUNING

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
IN.

395
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS.

396
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
AT LEAST 27, AND IT PUTS THIS

397
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TOWN, NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IN

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THE HISTORY BOOKS FOR ALL THE

399
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WRONG REASONS.

400
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
NOW THE DEADLIEST SHOOTING AT AN

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR A MIDDLE

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
SCHOOL IN AMERICA.

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WE KNOW THAT VIRGINIA TECH STILL

404
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
RANKS AS THE DEADLIEST.

405
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THAT WAS AN AWFUL SCENE.

406
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
WE ALL REMEMBER THAT.

407
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
COLUMBINE, OF COURSE, WE ALL

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
REMEMBER.

409
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
AND THIS COUNTRY JOINED ARMS AND

410
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
WHATEVER WE COULD TO STOP THESE

412
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
KIND OF SCENES FROM PLAYING OUT

413
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
EVER AGAIN.

414
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ALTHOUGH IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

415
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
TO DO.
THERE WILL BE TALK IN THE HOURS

416
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOW ABOUT

417
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT

418
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, ABOUT SIGNS THAT

419
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
COULD HAVE BEEN MISSED.

420
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
BUT THE TALK THIS AFTERNOON IS

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
ABOUT THE FAMILIES WHO'VE NOW

422
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
LOST LITTLE BOYS AND LITTLE

423
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
GIRLS AND MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE

424
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WAITING FOR THEIR MOM OR DAD TO

425
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
COME HOME.

426
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
STAFF MEMBERS INSIDE THAT

427
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
SCHOOL, TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF

428
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
MEMBERS WHO WE'VE BEEN TOLD

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT, AS WELL.

430
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE

431
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
PRESIDENT HERE MOMENTS FROM NOW,

432
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
AND AS JAKE POINTS OUT, SO

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
OFTEN, PRESIDENTS ARE CALLED

434
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
UPON AT THESE TIMES OF GREAT

435
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
NATIONAL GRIEF TO STAND BEFORE

436
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THE CAMERA, TO BE -- THE

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
COMFORTER IN CHIEF.

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
HE'LL BE THE FATHER IN CHIEF,

439
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
BECAUSE HE OFTEN TALKS ABOUT HIS

440
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
OWN TWO GIRLS WITH GREAT PRIDE.

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THEY HAVE DONE -- THEY'VE GONE

442
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
TO GREAT LENGTHS IN THE WHITE

443
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HOUSE TO PROTECT HIS OWN

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
DAUGHTERS, AND HERE'S THE

445
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
PRESIDENT NOW, TO THE NATION.

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

448
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
MUELLER.

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

450
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE
NATION.

451
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL HAVE

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT HE

453
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

454
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

455
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

456
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS,

459
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT, BUT

460
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD, AS A

461
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
PARENT.

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

463
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
TODAY.

464
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

465
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

466
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
DO.

468
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

470
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

472
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

473
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

474
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

475
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
WEDDINGS.

476
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

477
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

479
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

480
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

481
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
DREAMS.

482
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

483
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
FOR THE PARENTS, AND

484
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

485
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

486
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

487
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

488
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS, AS
WELL.

490
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
FOR, AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

491
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

492
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

493
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

494
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY,

495
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

496
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

497
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN

498
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

499
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

500
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTON, OR A SHOPPING

501
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
MALL IN OREGON, OR A TEMPLE IN

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

503
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
AURORA, OR A STREET CORNER IN

504
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

505
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

506
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

507
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

508
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

509
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

510
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

511
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
POLITICS.

512
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

513
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN

514
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

515
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER,

516
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

517
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
THEM, AND WILL REMIND EACH OTHER

518
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

519
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

520
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

521
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
TONIGHT, AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
RIGHT NOW, IN THE HARD DAYS TO

523
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
COME THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO

524
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
BE AT OUR BEST AS AMERICANS, AND

525
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
AS PRESIDENT TO HELP.

527
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

528
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

529
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

530
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A HAND TO THOSE IN NEED, TO

531
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

532
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

533
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES

535
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
NOT JUST IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT

536
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ALSO IN OURS.

537
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
VICTIMS, AND IN THE WORD'S OF

539
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE BROKEN

540
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
HEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

541
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WOUNDS.

542
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ADDRESSING

543
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THE NATION 3:20 IN THE

544
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
AFTERNOON, HOURS AFTER THAT

545
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
FIRST CALL CAME IN AFTER 9:30

546
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THIS MORNING.
THE PRESIDENT THERE IN THE

547
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
BRIEFING ROOM WIPING AWAY WHAT

548
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
APPEARED TO BE TEARS, AND NOT

549
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
SURPRISINGLY, AS WE ALL WATCHED

550
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
AS IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY SAD

551
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
AND TRAGIC DAY WE'RE ALL

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WITNESSING IN CONNECTICUT.

553
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THE PRESIDENT SAYING I REACT NOT

554
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
AS A PRESIDENT, BUT AS A PARENT.

555
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AND, JAKE, THIS IS -- THIS IS A

556
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
MAN WHO JUST ENDURED A TESTIFY

557
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
CAMPAIGN, HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF

558
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A FISCAL FIGHT IN WASHINGTON.

559
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
BUT WHEN WE OFTEN SEE HIM AT HIS

560
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
MOST EMOTIONAL MOMENT IS WHEN

561
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
HE'S TALKING AMONG HIS ROLE AS A

562
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
FATHER.

563
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
>> IT'S WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT

564
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT'S EXACTLY

565
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
RIGHT.
AND, DAVID, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU

566
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WERE ABLE TO SEE BUT LET ME JUST

567
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
TELL YOU FROM FOUR FEET AWAY

568
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THOSE WERE ABSOLUTELY TEARS THAT

569
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS WIPING AWAY

570
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
FROM HIS FACE, SEVERAL TIMES

571
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT MUST BE

572
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
LIKE FOR THOSE PARENTS TO BE IN

573
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
CONNECTICUT THIS EVENING,

574
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE MAJORITY

575
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED TODAY

576
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WERE

577
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
CHILDREN, AS HE DESCRIBED THEM,

578
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS.

579
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
BETWEEN 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

580
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
TALKING ABOUT HOW THEIR LIVES,

581
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULD WANT

582
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
TO DO IN THEIR LIVES, HAVING

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN, WOULD

584
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
NEVER HAPPEN.

585
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY, HE

586
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
SAID.
AS A COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

587
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

588
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
HE DID VOW THERE WAS ONE NOTE OF

589
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
POLITICS, SLIGHTLY, VAGUELY,

590
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

591
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
COME TOGETHER TO PREVENT FURTHER

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ACCIDENTS LIKE THIS, FURTHER

593
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM EVER

594
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
HAPPENING AGAIN, REGARDLESS OF

595
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THE POLITICS.

596
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
BUT FOR THE MOST PART, HE STAYED

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
AWAY FROM THAT, TALKING ABOUT

598
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
THE NEED TO -- FOR EVERY PARENT

599
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
TO COME TOGETHER AND HUG THEIR

600
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER THIS

601
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
EVENING.

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
AND OF COURSE, HE SAID, THERE
WOULD BE FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT

603
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THIS EVENING THAT WILL NOT BE

604
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ABLE TO DO THAT.

605
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
IT WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL ADDRESS,

606
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
WITHOUT QUESTION THE MOST

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
EMOTIONAL I'VE EVER SEEN HIM

608
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

609
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
DAVID?
>> I'D HAVE TO SAY THE SAME

610
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THING, JAKE, IN WATCHING HIM.

611
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
HE WIPED AWAY TEARS SEVERAL

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TIMES.

613
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I WAS MOVED, REALLY, BY THE SAME

614
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
THING, JAKE, WHEN HE POINTED OUT

615
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE VICTIMS

616
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
IN THIS SCHOOL WERE CHILDREN,

617
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
AND HE SAID AS HE ADDRESSED THIS

618
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
PASSION, THEY WERE 5 TO 10 YEARS

619
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
OLD AND THEY JUST HAD DREAMS OF

620
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
MANY OF THEM WHAT SANTA WOULD

621
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
BRING FOR CHRISTMAS, WHAT THEY

622
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WOULD CELEBRATE WITH THEIR

623
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
FAMILY DURING HANUKKAH AND THESE

624
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
RECENT DAYS.

625
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
MAKING IT THROUGH THE END OF

626
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THESE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS SO WE

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
COULD HAVE THAT GREAT,

628
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
WELL-DESERVED CHRISTMAS AND NEW

629
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
YEAR'S VACATION.

630
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AS JAKE POINTS OUT, HE SAID,

631
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
MICHELLE AND I WILL HUG OUR OWN

632
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
CHILDREN EVEN THOUGH MANY IN

633
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THAT -- THAT REGION OF THE

634
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
COUNTRY, NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

635
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME

636
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
WITH THEIRS.

637
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
ONE OTHER THING HE SAID, NOT A

638
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
PARENT IN AMERICA DOESN'T FEEL

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
THE SAME OVERWHELMING FEELING OF

640
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
GRIEF, AS HE WIPED ONE OF THOSE

641
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
TEARS AWAY, AND AS YOU LOOK AT

642
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
THESE PICTURES YOU CAN

643
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
UNDERSTAND, REALLY, HOW THE

644
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE WATCHING

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
TODAY, ANYONE WHO HAS CHILDREN
IN THEIR LIVES, TO IMAGINE THAT

646
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THE CHILDREN OF THIS SCHOOL

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WALKED OUT TO NOT ONLY HAVE THEY

648
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
ESCAPED THE SCHOOL UNDER THOSE

649
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THEY

650
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
WALKED OUT TO SEE, YOU KNOW,

651
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
TEARFUL ADULTS, AND CELL PHONES

652
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER OR NOT

653
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THEIR CHILDREN HAD SURVIVED.

654
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
AUTHORITIES WITH GUNS DRAWN.

655
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WE KNOW THAT FOR QUITE SOME TIME

656
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
AFTER THOSE INITIAL CALLS THAT

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THEY WERE OUT SEARCHING, NOT

658
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
ONLY THE NEIGHBORHOOD

659
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SURROUNDING THE SCHOOL, BUT

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
GOING CAR-TO-CAR LOOKING INSIDE

661
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THOSE SCHOOLS.
WE KNOW THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE

662
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BEEN GIVEN ONE MISSION WHEN THAT

663
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
CALL CAME IN, WHEN THAT ALERT

664
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WENT OUT.
THAT WAS TO GET THE CHILDREN OUT

665
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
AND TO THE FIRE HOUSE AROUND THE

666
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
CORNER.
YOU CAN SEE THIS PICTURE THERE.

667
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
ONE OF THE ADULTS TAKING

668
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
CHILDREN AWAY.

669
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THE CHILDREN HOLDING HANDS, AND

670
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
ALL OF US, WATCHING WITH YOU AT

671
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
HOME, IN OUR STUDIO HERE IN NEW

672
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
YORK, WITH OUR MONITORS TAKING

673
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
IN THE SAME IMAGES YOU ARE, AND

674
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
MOVED BY SORT OF THE RESILIENCY

675
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
OF THESE LITTLE FACES.

676
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
MANY OF THEM LEAVING ALL THE

677
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
STUFF BEHIND, BEING WRAPPED ONE

678
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
OF THEM BY A FIREMAN IN A

679
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
BLANKET.
THE OTHER CHILDREN THAT WE'VE

680
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SEEN WRAPPED IN THEIR PARENTS'

681
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
CLOTHES WHO SHOWED UP, THEY WERE

682
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
THE LUCKY PARENTS WHO SHOWED UP

683
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
AND FOUND THEIR CHILDREN WERE

684
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WAITING AT THAT FIREHOUSE, HAD

685
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
TO GIVE THEM A HUG AND A COAT

686
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND NOW THE DIFFICULT TASK AS

687
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
WE'VE HEARD ALL MORNING LONG OF

688
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
TALKING IT THROUGH WITH YOUR

689
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
CHILDREN.

690
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
SENSING WHERE THEY ARE ON THIS.

691
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
AND THEN THAT TRICKY BALANCE

692
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
WHICH IS NOT TO OVERTALK IT, BUT

693
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE

694
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ADDRESSED IT AND LET THEM KNOW

695
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
IT'S SO RARE, IT'S SO RARE, AND

696
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
REASSURE THEM THAT THINGS WILL

697
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
BE NORMAL AGAIN.

698
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
THE SHOCK OF AUTHORITIES WALKING

699
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
ACROSS THAT ROOF.

700
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
WE KNOW THEY SWOOPED IN VERY

701
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
QUICKLY, BEGAN WALKING THROUGH
THE SCHOOL, CLASSROOM TO

702
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
CLASSROOM, WE HEARD EARLIER

703
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
TODAY THAT DESCRIPTION.

704
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY CHECKED EVERY CRACK, EVERY

705
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
CREVICE IN THE SCHOOL BEFORE

706
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THEY DETERMINED THAT THEY HAD

707
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SECURED THE FACILITY.

708
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WE DO KNOW FROM PIERRE THOMAS'

709
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
REPORTING A SHORT TIME AGO THAT

710
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
NOT ONLY ARE THEY INVESTIGATING

711
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THE HORROR INFLICTED AT THIS

712
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SCENE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

713
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
HERE, BUT THEY'RE ALSO AT THE

714
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
SCENE OF A HOME IN NEW JERSEY.

715
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
IT'S BELIEVED TO BE THE HOME OF

716
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
THE GUNMAN.

717
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
AND HIS MOTHER.

718
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WHAT'S NOT KNOWN IS IF RYAN

719
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
LANZA STILL LIVES AT THAT HOME.

720
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
BUT WE KNOW HE'S 24 YEARS OLD.

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
OBVIOUSLY YOUNG AND WHAT WOULD

722
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
APPEAR TO BE A VERY TROUBLED

723
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
YOUNG MAN.

724
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AND THE QUESTIONS IN THE DAYS

725
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THAT WILL FOLLOW WILL BE ALL

726
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
ABOUT THE RED FLAGS, AND WHAT

727
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE AS WE

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
ALWAYS DO COME TOGETHER AS A

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
NATION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WE CAN TRY TO PREVENT THIS FROM

731
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

732
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THIS

733
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
STORY THAT MOVED US ALL IS THAT

734
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THIS SCHOOL TRIED TO DO WHAT IT

735
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
COULD TO TRY TO BEEF UP SECURITY

736
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
ACTUALLY SENDING OUT A LETTER TO

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
PARENTS AT HOME SAYING THERE

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
WOULD BE NEW SECURITY PROCEDURES

740
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
IN PLACE.
IT WAS FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR, IN

741
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
FACT, A SECURITY SYSTEM IN ALL

742
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO ENSURE

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
SAFETY, THEY WROTE.

744
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WROTE.

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
EVERY VISITOR WILL BE REQUIRED

746
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
TO RING THE DOORBELL AT THE

747
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
FRONT ENTRANCE, PROBABLY SOUNDS

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
LIKE A SCHOOL IN YOUR PART OF

749
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THE COUNTRY.
RING THE DOORBELL.

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THE OFFICE STAFF WILL USE A

751
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
VISUAL MONITORING SYSTEM TO

752
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
ALLOW ENTRY.

753
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
VISITORS WILL STILL BE REQUIRED

754
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE OFFICE

755
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AND SIGN IN AND IF WE DON'T

756
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
RECOGNIZE YOU, YOU'LL BE

757
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
REQUIRED TO SHOW YOUR I.D.

758
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH

759
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
NEARLY OVER 700 CHILDREN, OVER

760
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
1,000 PARENTS REPRESENTING 500

761
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
FAMILIES MOST PARENTS WILL BE

762
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
ASKED TO SHOW I.D.

763
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HEAT

764
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
OF A MOMENT TRYING TO PICK YOUR

765
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
KID UP AND RUNNING A BUNCH OF

766
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ERRANDS I'M SURE THAT PROBABLY

767
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
CAN SEEM LIKE AN INCONVENIENCE.

768
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
BUT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WE CAN

769
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

770
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
GOING ALONG WITH ANYTHING YOU

771
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
CAN TO TRY TO MAKE THAT SCHOOL

772
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SAFER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT

773
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
APPEARS THE SCHOOL TRIED TO DO.

774
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
DAN HARRIS IS AT THE SCHOOL.

775
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
AND DAN, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE

776
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HAD YOUR EAR PIECE IN.

777
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW

778
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
SANDY HOOK ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED

779
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
SOME ADDITIONAL SECURITY THIS

780
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
SCHOOL YEAR ALONE, NOT A SCHOOL

781
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ON LOCKDOWN, BUT WITH HAVING TO

782
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
REPORT TO THE OFFICE AND SHOW AN

783
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
CRYDY.
AND IT WOULD SEEM THEY WERE

784
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
DOING JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

785
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
POSSIBLE OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW,

786
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
BARRICADING THE SCHOOL, WHICH WE

787
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ALL KNOW IS JUST NOT REALITY IN

788
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
AMERICA TODAY.

789
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
>> RIGHT.
I DID HEAR YOU.

790
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HOW MUCH CAN YOU DO, ASIDE FROM

791
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
TURN SCHOOLS INTO FORT KNOX, HOW

792
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
MUCH CAN YOU DO TO BLOCK A

793
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
DERANGED PERSON WHO IS HEAVILY

794
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
ARMED AND INTENT ON KILLING

795
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
PEOPLE?

796
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
THIS SCHOOL CLEARLY TOOK EXTRA

797
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
MEASURES VERY RECENTLY.
TO IMPLEMENT SECURITY.

798
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IT'S UNCLEAR, THOUGH, WHAT MORE

799
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THEY COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT

800
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE TODAY.

801
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WE ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE

802
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE WHERE

803
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
PARENTS HAVE BEEN REUNITING WITH

804
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THEIR CHILDREN ALL DAY.

805
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I SHOULD CLARIFY, THOUGH, THAT

806
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WHEN WE CAME HERE SEVERAL HOURS

807
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
AGO WHAT WE WERE SEEING IS

808
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
PARENTS REUNITING WITH THEIR

809
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
CHILDREN, TAKING THEIR CHILDREN

810
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
HOME, WHICH IS QUITE POIGNANT.

811
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS

812
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
SOMETHING MUCH MORE DISTURBING.

813
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WHICH IS WE'RE SEEING ONE BY

814
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
ONE, MANY FAMILIES LEAVING,

815
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
ESCORTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

816
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
OFFICERS, AND THESE ARE FAMILIES

817
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN WITH

818
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEM.

819
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW THEIR

820
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
STORIES, BUT ONE CAN INFER THAT

821
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
AT LEAST SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

822
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
ARE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR

823
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
CHILDREN, PERHAPS TODAY, IN THE

824
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
LITTLE SCHOOLHOUSE DOWN THIS

825
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
STREET.

826
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
HARD TO MANAGE A MORE WRENCHING

827
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
CIRCUMSTANCE THAN TO HAVE TO

828
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WALK OUT HERE IN FRONT OF ALL

829
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THESE REPORTERS AND IN FRONT OF

830
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ALL THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT

831
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
OFFICERS, SOME OF THEM WITH

832
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
TEARS IN THEIR EYES, SOME OF

833
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THEM ON CELL PHONES, PERHAPS

834
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
UPDATING THEIR FAMILIES ON WHAT

835
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
TRANSPIRED HERE TODAY.

836
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ALL OF THEM ESCORTED BY LAW

837
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO THEIR

838
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
CARS, ON THEIR WAY HOME, TO A

839
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
HOME THAT WILL BE QUITE EMGTTY

840
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
FROM NOW ON FOR MORE THAN -- FOR

841
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
PERHAPS TWO DOZEN FAMILIES IN
THIS TOWN HERE TONIGHT.

842
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
>> DAN, REALLY MOVED BY THE

843
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
LITTLE GIRL THAT YOU

844
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
INTERVIEWED, HER NAME WAS ALEXIS

845
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
A SHORT TIME AGO IN OUR COVERAGE

846
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
HERE ON ABC NEWS, AND AS YOU AND

847
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I BOTH KNOW, SOME OF THE MOST

848
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
HONEST PEOPLE OUT THERE WHEN WE

849
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
GO OUT TO DO THE STORIES EVERY

850
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
DAY IN AMERICA ARE THE CHILDREN

851
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
WE INTERVIEW.
AND WHEN SHE TOLD YOU, I JUST

852
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
FELT SICK, I FELT LIKE I WAS

853
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
GOING TO BE SICK.

854
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
AND I THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S

855
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
PROBABLY HOW SO MANY OF THOSE

856
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
CHILDREN FELT, AND WHAT A BRAVE

857
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
LITTLE GIRL TO SHARE THAT WITH

858
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
YOU TODAY.

859
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
>> SHE WAS A BRAVE GIRL.

860
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
AND THAT REALLY WAS SUCH A

861
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
POWERFUL THING SHE SAID ABOUT

862
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
FEELING SICK.

863
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
SHE KNEW IN HER GUT THAT

864
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
SOMETHING VERY WRONG HAD

865
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
TRANSPIRED.

866
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
IN A CLASSROOM NOT FAR FROM

867
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
HERS.

868
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
SHE DESCRIBE D PEOPLE SCREAMING

869
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
AND CRYING.

870
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
SHE SAID THE SCREAMING WASN'T SO

871
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
BAD BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF

872
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
CRYING.
PEOPLE KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS

873
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
DEEPLY AMISS.

874
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
IT WAS ALSO REALLY STRIKING TO

875
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
HEAR -- SORRY WE'RE IN A PLACE

876
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
WITH A LOT OF REPORTERS HERE, SO

877
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WALKING BACK

878
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE

879
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
CAMERA.
IT WAS ALSO STRIKING TO HEAR

880
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
FROM ALEXIS' MOM AND TO SEE HOW

881
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
GRATEFUL SHE WAS TO BE WITH HER

882
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
CHILD.

883
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
SOMETHING ELSE HER MOTHER SAID

884
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS SHE

885
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
FELT THE NEED TO PINCH HERSELF

886
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY, JUST TO

887
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
REMIND HERSELF THAT THIS ISN'T A

888
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
DREAM, IT IS, IN FACT, A LIVING

889
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
NIGHTMARE.
THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED HERE IN

890
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THIS SMALL TOWN OF FEWER THAN

891
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
30,000 PEOPLE.
AS WE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS

892
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
DAY, ONE NEVER EXPECTS SOMETHING

893
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

894
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
BUT THIS IS A TRULY UNLIKELY

895
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
BACKDROP FOR THIS KIND OF

896
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
HORROR.
THIS IS, AS I SAID, A TOWN OF

897
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
FEWER THAN 30,000 PEOPLE IN

898
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND.

899
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
KNOWN FOR HAVING A TOWN MEETING

900
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
HOUSE IN THE CENTER OF TOWN.

901
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
AN HISTORIC PLACE WHERE THE

902
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
CERTAIN MOMENTS IN THE

903
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
REVOLUTIONARY WAR, THE

904
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PLAYED OUT

905
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
HERE.
THIS IS A TOWN WHERE THEIR TOWN

906
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
SYMBOL IS A ROOSTER.

907
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THIS IS A QUINTESSENTIAL NEW

908
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
ENGLAND TOWN.

909
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A TOWN, BY THE WAY, THAT I USED

910
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
TO COME VISIT WHEN I WAS A KID

911
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
BECAUSE I HAD FAMILY HERE.

912
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
A SMALL TOWN WITH LOTS OF

913
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
CUL-DE-SACS AND HAPPY FAMILIES.

914
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN HERE IS

915
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
HORRIFIC.

916
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
>> DAN HARRIS, A NEW ENGLANDER

917
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
HIMSELF, REPORTING ON HOW

918
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
UNLIKELY THEY FELT THAT THEY

919
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
WOULD BE TARGETED BY SUCH HORROR

920
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
IN THIS LITTLE TOWN TODAY, UNDER

921
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
A CLEAR SKY, ON A CHILLY FRIDAY

922
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
MORNING, MAKING IT THROUGH

923
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
ANOTHER WEEK OF SCHOOL AND

924
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
TRYING TO GET CLOSER TO THAT

925
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
HOLIDAY.

926
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
AND DAN, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

927
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
REPORTING.
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS

928
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
TO SHOW ONE OF THOSE SCENES, AND

929
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
STAND A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE AWAY

930
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
BUT TRY TO INFORM, REALLY, THAT

931
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
COMMUNITY AND THE NATION AS A

932
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
WHOLE OF WHAT'S TRANSPIRING.

933
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I DID WANT TO LET OUR AUDIENCE

934
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
KNOW, IT'S NOW 3:30, OBVIOUSLY,

935
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
OUT HERE ON THE EAST COAST.

936
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
AND WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE

937
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN,

938
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
CONNECTICUT, AT AN ELEMENTARY

939
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
SCHOOL.
SANDY HOOK, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

940
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
IT'S BELIEVED ANYWHERE BETWEEN

941
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
500, 700 KIDS GO TO SCHOOL THERE

942
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
EVERY DAY.

943
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, AND

944
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
IT'S A NUMBER THAT WILL ETCH

945
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AT LEAST 27

946
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SHOT AND KILLED.

947
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
IT MAKES IT THE DEADLIEST DAY IN

948
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THIS

949
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
COUNTRY.

950
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM WASHINGTON

951
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
THAT THE FLAG, THE UNITED STATES

952
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
FLAG, WILL BE FLOWN AT

953
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
HALF-STAFF AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

954
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
AND UPON ALL PUBLIC BUILDINGS

955
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
AND GROUNDS, AT ALL MILITARY

956
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
POSTS AND NAVAL STATIONS, ON ALL

957
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
NAVAL VESSELS OF THE FEDERAL

958
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
GOVERNMENT THROUGHOUT THE U.S.

959
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
UNTIL SUNSET ON DECEMBER THE

960
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
1th.
YOU CAN SEE THE FLAG RIGHT

961
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THERE, ABOVE THE WHITE HOUSE.

962
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
AND IT COMES JUST A SHORT TIME,

963
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO, THE

964
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
PRESIDENT STOOD BEFORE THIS

965
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
COUNTRY AND WIPED AWAY TEARS,

966
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
SEVERAL TIMES, AS HE TALKED

967
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
ABOUT ENDURING SO MANY OF THESE

968
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TRAGEDIES, THAT HE REACTS NOT AS

969
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
A PRESIDENT, BUT AS A PARENT.

970
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
AND HE SURMISED THAT NOT A

971
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
PARENT IN THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T

972
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
FEEL THE SAME WAY HE'S FEELING

973
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
TODAY.

974
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
AND HE SAID THAT HE AND THE

975
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
FIRST LADY, MICHELLE OBAMA, WILL

976
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
EMBRACE THEIR LITTLE GIRLS, NOT

977
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
SO LITTLE ANYMORE.

978
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
THEY'RE GETTING TALLER AND

979
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TALLER EVERY TIME WE SEE THEM.

980
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BUT EMBRACING THEM WHEN THEY GET

981
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
HOME FROM SCHOOL.

982
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
HE WAS VISIBLY EMOTIONAL.

983
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I THINK THE MOST EMOTIONAL I'VE

984
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SEEN AND JAKE SAID THE SAME

985
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
THING, JAKE TAPPER AT THE WHITE

986
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
HOUSE.

987
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AS HE PREPARES TO START HIS

988
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
SECOND TERM, AND THEY HAVE

989
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WORKED SO HARD AS A FIRST FAMILY

990
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
TO SHIELD THEIR DAUGHTERS FROM

991
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THE PUBLIC EYE, AND SO I CAN

992
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
ONLY IMAGINE SEEING THESE

993
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
LITTLE -- THESE LITTLE FACES

994
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
THAT ARE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION

995
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
TODAY, THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR

996
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
OWN, THROUGH NO CHOICE OF THEIR

997
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
OWN, THRUST INTO THE NATIONAL

998
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
SPOTLIGHT, BECAUSE OF THE

999
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
HORRIFIC SCENE THAT UNFOLDED AT

1000
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THEIR SCHOOL TODAY.

1001
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I DID WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE

1002
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THOMAS WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING

1003
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
DEVELOPMENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1004
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
PIERRE, WE SAW THE FLAG FLYING

1005
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
AT HALF-STAFF OVER THE WHITE

1006
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HOUSE.
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT A SHORT

1007
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
TIME AGO WE ALSO HEARD FROM HIM,

1008
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
IT WASN'T OVERT POLITICS, BUT WE

1009
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
DID HEAR FROM HIM THE NEED,

1010
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BECAUSE WE REPORT SO OFTEN ON

1011
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
THESE CASES THAT NOW SOMEONE

1012
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO TRY

1013
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
TO KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN.

1014
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
>> WELL, DAVE, IT'S FAIR TO SAY

1015
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
THAT THESE TYPES OF SHOOTINGS

1016
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ARE BOMBING CHRONIC, PERSISTENT.

1017
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
JUST THIS YEAR ALONE YOU HAD THE

1018
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
SHOOTING AT THE COLORADO MOVIE

1019
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THEATER.
YOU HAD THE SHOOTING AT THE SIKH

1020
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TEMPLE.

1021
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
REALLY SINCE VIRGINIA TECH IN

1022
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
2007, WE'VE HAD MASS SHOOTINGS

1023
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
LIKE THIS ON A PRETTY REGULAR

1024
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BASIS IN WHICH THREE OR MORE

1025
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

1026
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AND WE'RE TALKING LITERALLY

1027
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

1028
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
SO, I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

1029
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
GETTING AT THE NOTION OF WHETHER

1030
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL

1031
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
GUN CONTROL MEASURES, THERE'S

1032
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
BEEN A SPIKE IN GUN SALES IN THE

1033
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
LAST MONTH OR SO.

1034
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
IN FACT, THE DAY AFTER

1035
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THANKSGIVING THE FBI RECORDED

1036
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
THE MOST BACKGROUND CHECKS EVER,

1037
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
EVER, IN THE HISTORY OF THE

1038
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
COUNTRY, IN TERMS OF HANDGUN

1039
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
SALES.

1040
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
AND RIFLE SALES.

1041
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AND MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT'S

1042
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED

1043
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAT ADDITIONAL GUN CONTROL

1044
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MEASURES ARE COMING.

1045
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> YEAH, AND SO MANY PEOPLE JUST

1046
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
WANT TO FIND COMMON GROUND ON

1047
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THIS ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY,

1048
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
FEELING SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE

1049
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

1050
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE RIGHT

1051
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
AS A PARENT TO PROTECT THESE

1052
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
SCHOOLS.
>> DAVID --

1053
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
>> YEAH, GO AHEAD, PIERRE.

1054
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
>> ONE THING I WOULD ADD IS

1055
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
LOOK, THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED

1056
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
PROBLEM.
THERE ARE SOME ESTIMATES THAT

1057
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THERE ARE OVER 300 MILLION, 300

1058
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
MILLION GUNS ALREADY IN

1059
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
CIRCULATION.
SO IF YOU STOP SELLING THEM

1060
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TOMORROW, THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT

1061
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
GO AWAY.

1062
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
AS ONE SOURCE TOLD ME, GUNS ARE

1063
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
NOT BIODEGRADABLE.

1064
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SO THIS PROBLEM WILL BE WITH US.

1065
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
BUT AGAIN WITH THE SITUATION

1066
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
DEVELOPING WHERE EVERY FEW

1067
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
WEEKS, EVERY FEW MONTHS, HAVING

1068
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
MASS SHOOTINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

1069
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
IN WHAT THEY CALL SOFT TARGETS,

1070
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
WHERE THE SHOOTERS GO TO PLACES

1071
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WHERE THERE'S LIKELY TO BE

1072
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
LITTLE SECURITY, LIKELY TO BE

1073
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
LOTS OF PEOPLE IN A CONCENTRATED

1074
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
FASHION, AND MOW THEM DOWN, THIS

1075
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
IS A QUESTION THAT THE COUNTRY

1076
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
SEEMS IS GOING TO HAVE TO

1077
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
ADDRESS AT SOME POINT.

1078
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
>> NOT ONLY QUESTION WE'LL HAVE

1079
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
TO ADDRESS BUT A CONVERSATION,

1080
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PIERRE, AS YOU POINT OUT THAT'S

1081
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
ALREADY STARTED.

1082
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
WE JUST GOT THIS FROM MARK

1083
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
KELLY, OF COURSE, THE ASTRONAUT,

1084
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE COMMANDER, THE HUSBAND OF

1085
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
GABRIELLE GIFFORDS, THE

1086
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO WAS SHOT IN

1087
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TUCSON, AND HE WRITES ON

1088
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
FACEBOOK THAT THIS TIME OUR

1089
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
RESPONSE MUST CONSIST OF MORE

1090
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THAN REGRET, MORE THAN SORROW,

1091
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
MORE THAN CONDOLENCES.

1092
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THE CHILDREN OF SANDY HOOK

1093
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND ALL THE

1094
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE DESERVE

1095
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
LEADERS WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO

1096
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEANINGFUL

1097
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR GUN LAWS.

1098
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SO THERE WILL BE SOME PRESSURE

1099
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
TO ADDRESS THIS WITHOUT

1100
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
INFRINGING UPON THE RIGHTS OF

1101
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OTHER AMERICANS WHO, OF COURSE,

1102
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT

1103
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
PROTECTING THOSE RIGHTS.

1104
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
SO IT'S A VERY CAREFUL, CAREFUL

1105
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
DEBATE THAT WILL ENSUE IN THE

1106
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME.

1107
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000

1187
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO RESTATE

1188
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE

1189
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
MADE AVAILABLE EARLIER.

1190
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS, BUT I

1191
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
MUST PREFACE MY REMARKS BY

1192
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
SAYING THIS IS AN ACTIVE,

1193
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

1194
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO

1195
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
GO.
AND THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS

1196
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THAT WE CANNOT CONFIRM OR

1197
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
DISCUSS AS OF YET.

1198
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
BUT SHORTLY AFTER 9:30 THIS

1199
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
MORNING THE NEWTOWN POLICE

1200
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A CALL FOR

1201
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HELP AT THE SANDY HOOK

1202
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN
NEWTOWN.

1203
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
UPON REALIZING THE INTENSITY AND

1204
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
DIFFICULTY OF THE SITUATION, WE

1205
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WERE ON CALL FOR SURROUNDING

1206
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE

1207
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
POLICE TO ASSIST.
UPON ARRIVAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

1208
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
OFFICERS AT THE SCHOOL THEY

1209
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IMMEDIATELY ENTERED THE SCHOOL

1210
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
AS WE KNEW THIS WAS AN ACTIVE,

1211
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
POTENTIAL ACTIVE SHOOTER

1212
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
SITUATION.

1213
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
THEIR FOCUS WAS TO SEARCH FOR

1214
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND STAFF,

1215
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
AND REMOVE THEM TO A SAFE AREA

1216
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL.

1217
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THEY DID SEARCH EVERY NOOK AND

1218
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
CRANNY, EVERY ROOM, AND EVERY

1219
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
PORTION OF THAT SCHOOL AND

1220
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
ACCOMPLISHED THAT TASK.

1221
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THEY TOOK THE RESCUED TO A

1222
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
STAGING AREA TO REUNITE THEM

1223
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
WITH FAMILY MEMBERS.

1224
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, THERE WERE

1225
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
FATALITIES.

1226
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THERE WERE 18 CHILDREN THAT WERE

1227
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCHOOL.

1228
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE

1229
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS

1230
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
AND PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

1231
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HOSPITALS.
AND THERE WERE SIX ADULTS

1232
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE AT

1233
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THE SCHOOL.
AS THE GOVERNOR REPORTED THE

1234
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
SHOOTER IS DECEASED.

1235
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
IS DECEASED IN THE SCHOOL.

1236
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF WORK

1237
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
GOING ON RELATIVE TO THAT,

1238
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THAT'S THE REASON WE HAVE NOT

1239
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
IDENTIFIED HIM AS OF YET.

1240
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
BY THAT I MEAN SEARCH WARRANTS,

1241
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
EXAMINATION OF AREAS OF

1242
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
RESIDENCE, EMPLOYMENT, AND ANY

1243
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
ANCILLARY THINGS THAT MAY BE

1244
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ATTACHED TO THE IDENTITY AND TO

1245
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THAT INDIVIDUAL.
THE SCENE HAS BEEN SECURED.

1246
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
NEWTOWN POLICE OFFICERS, STATE

1247
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
POLICE MAJOR CRIME UNITS FROM

1248
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
BOTH WESTERN DISTRICT AND

1249
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
CENTRAL DISTRICT HAVE RESPONDED,

1250
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
AND ARE WORKING WITH SEVERAL

1251
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
AGENCIES TO PROCESS THIS SCENE.

1252
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
IT IS NOT A SIMPLISTIC SCENE, AS

1253
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
YOU CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND.

1254
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY,

1255
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
WE NEED TO DOCUMENT THE ENTIRE

1256
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
SCENE, AND SIMPLY STATED WE NEED

1257
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
TO ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION

1258
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SURROUNDING EXACTLY HOW AND WHY

1259
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED.

1260
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, WE WILL BE

1261
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
HERE THROUGH THE NIGHT, BUT

1262
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
CERTAINLY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

1263
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
WE'RE NOT EVEN PUTTING A TIME

1264
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
STAMP ON THIS AS TO WHEN WE WILL

1265
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
COMPLETE THIS PROJECT.

1266
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WE'LL WORK WITH THE MEDICAL

1267
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
EXAMINER'S OFFICE.

1268
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH POSITIVE

1269
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
IDENTIFICATION AND THERE'S A

1270
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
GREAT DEAL OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO

1271
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
BE DONE THERE AT THE SCHOOL.

1272
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WE'LL TAKE AGAIN, VERY BRIEF

1273
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
QUESTIONS, BUT UNDERSTAND THAT

1274
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THIS IS AN ACTIVE, ONGOING CASE

1275
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT

1276
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT DISCUSS

1277
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
AT THIS TIME.

1278
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
YES, SIR?

1279
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000

1280
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
FATHER'S HOME IN NEW JERSEY AND

1281
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THE MOTHER'S HOME --

1282
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
>> THERE IS A SECONDARY CRIME

1283
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
SCENE HERE IN NEWTOWN, THAT IS,

1284
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
IN FACT, CORRECT.

1285
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
THERE IS A AN ADULT DECEASED AT

1286
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THAT LOCATION.

1287
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I CAN'T DISCUSS ANY FURTHER

1288
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
INFORMATION ON THAT AT THIS

1289
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000

OKAY, ONE SECTION AND TWO ROOMS.

ONE AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO ON THAT

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ANSWER.
I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY HOW

1339
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
MANY ROOMS ARE INVOLVED.

1340
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE TWO,

1341
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000

1345
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
SECTION OF THE BUILDING IS AS

1346
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
FAR AS WE WANT TO GO.

1347
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
WE DID NOT.

1348
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED ONCE THE

1349

THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT OUR

INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE

TO LOOK AT THOROUGHLY AND

1369
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
COMPLETELY AND THAT WILL TAKE

1370
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
SOME TIME TO TRY AND ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.

PROCESS.
>> DO WE KNOW THE AGES OF THE

1384

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
ARE AMONG THE DEAD.

1470
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL TO 26

1471
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
DEAD, AND THEN THE GUNMAN.

1472
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
SO THAT'S WHERE THE NUMBER 27

1473
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
COMES FROM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1474
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
SO 18 CHILDREN, 6 ADULTS, AND

1475
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
THE GUNMAN.

1476
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
AND WE DO BELIEVE, ACCORDING TO

1477
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THE LIEUTENANT THERE MOMENTS AGO

1478
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
THAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ADULT

1479
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
WHO IS DECEASED AT A SEPARATE

1480
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
LOCATION IN NEWTOWN, HE SAID.

1481
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
RIGHT THERE IN THAT COMMUNITY.

1482
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
ANOTHER ADULT, HE WOULD NOT SAY

1483
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE SUSPECT,

1484
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THOUGH WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

1485
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
WAS A RELATIONSHIP AT THE

1486
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
SCHOOL, THE MOTHER, IN FACT, A

1487
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL TEACHING

1488
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
KINDERGARTEN, HAS BEEN THE

1489
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
BELIEF.
THE SCHOOL IS K THROUGH 4 AND HE

1490
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
POINTED OUT IT WAS IN TWO ROOMS

1491
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
OF THE SCHOOL.

1492
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ONE PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE

1493
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
SCHOOL, 18 CHILDREN.

1494
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
18 CHILDREN, 6 ADULTS IN THAT

1495
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
SCHOOL, AND THEN WHAT HE DIDN'T

1496
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
MAKE CLEAR IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

1497
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
GUNMAN THE SUSPECT THEN TOOK

1498
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THEIR OWN LIFE OR WHETHER OR NOT

1499
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AUTHORITIES HAD ACTUALLY ENTERED

1500
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THE SCHOOL AT THAT POINT.

1501
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
HE SAID HE SIMPLY DID NOT KNOW

1502
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
HE PROMISED, OF COURSE, TO COME

1503
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
BACK IN FRONT OF REPORTERS IN AN

1504
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
HOUR TO PROVIDE MORE AND WE'LL

1505
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
BRING THAT TO YOU JUST AS SOON

1506
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
AS WE CAN.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR

1507
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE

1508
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
THOMAS, WHO'S BEEN AHEAD OF THIS

1509
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY FOR US

1510
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
TODAY, PIERRE.

1511
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
HE HELPED PAINT THE PICTURE

1512
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.
>> WELL, DAVID, THE SITUATION IS

1513
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
STILL VERY FLUID.

1514
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
WE'RE GETTING ADDITIONAL

1515
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
INFORMATION.
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES

1516
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
WERE INITIALLY GIVEN THE NAME OF

1517
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
RYAN LANZA, 24, AS BEING THE

1518
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
SHOOTER.

1519
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
BUT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY THOSE

1520
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
SAME SOURCES THAT THERE'S SOME

1521
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
CONFUSION NOW.
IT MAY, IN FACT, THE SHOOTER

1522
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
MAY, IN FACT, BE HIS BROTHER

1523
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
ADAM LANZA.

1524
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT

1525
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
CLEARED UP AS WE SPEAK, LAW

1526
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY,

1527
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
AGAIN, IT'S A VERY FLUID

1528
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
SITUATION, AND OBVIOUSLY THE

1529
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
SHOOTER IS DEAD AND THEY'RE

1530
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
TRYING TO CONFIRM ALL THE

1531
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE.

1532
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
>> THANK YOU, PIERRE.

1533
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT

1534
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
OUT THE TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE

1535
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
TAKEN TO AREA HOSPITALS AND WHO

1536
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
DIED AT THE HOSPITAL, AS YOU

1537
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
REMEMBER, EARLIER IN OUR

1538
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
COVERAGE WE REPORTED THREE

1539
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
PEOPLE HAD BEEN RUSHED TO THE

1540
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
HOSPITAL.
NOW WE'VE LEARNED THAT TWO OF

1541
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
THEM WERE CHILDREN, AND THEY DID

1542
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
NOT SURVIVE THIS.

1543
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
SO IT'S 18 CHILDREN IN THE

1544
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
SCHOOL, 2 CHILDREN AT THE

1545
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
HOSPITAL, 6 ADULTS AT THE

1546
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
SCHOOL, AND THE GUNMAN.

1547
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN

1548
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
AT THIS HOUR IS THE OTHER ADULT

1549
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
WHO IS DECEASED, AS WELL, AT A

1550
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
SEPARATE LOCATION, A SECOND

1551
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
LOCATION WHERE AUTHORITIES ARE

1552
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
RIGHT NOW INVESTIGATING AND

1553
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU JUST AS

1554
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SOON AS IT COMES IN.

1555
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I WANT TO GO TO A MOMENT THAT WE

1556
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
HAD EARLIER THAT I WAS MOVED BY

1557
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
AND I'M SURE IF YOU'VE BEEN WITH

1558
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
US THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THAT YOU

1559
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WERE, TOO, IT'S THE LITTLE BOY,

1560
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
HIS LITTLE SHORT HAIR, AND WHAT

1561
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
HE FELT, WHAT HE SAW, WHAT HE

1562
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
SAID WHEN HE WAS ONE OF THE

1563
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
STUDENTS TO GET OUT OF THAT

1564
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
SCHOOL AND THEN TURN ON BOTH

1565
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
SIDES AND SAW HIS FRIENDS HAD

1566
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
MADE IT OUT, TOO.

1567
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
HERE HE IS.

1568
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
>> THERE'S A MAN CAME DOWN WITH

1569
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
HANDCUFFS ON AND WE THOUGHT THAT

1570
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
WAS THE VICTIM.

1571
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
WE DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM

1572
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE THERE WAS A

1573
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
CAR BLOCKING IT.

1574
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
PLUS WE WERE RUNNING REALLY

1575
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
QUICK.
SO THEN WE GOT TO THE FIREHOUSE,

1576
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
AND WE SAT IN OUR CLASSES, AND

1577
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
WE WERE ALL REALLY HAPPY THAT WE

1578
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
WERE ALL ALIVE.

1579
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> IT WAS TERRIFYING.

1580
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'M STILL TERRIFIED.

1581
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I THINK I'M STILL IN SHOCK ABOUT

1582
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
IT ALL.

1583
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I STILL DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING

1584
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THAT HAPPENED.
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME

1585
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
PEOPLE MISSING THAT THEY'VE BEEN
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

1586
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE'S BEEN

1587
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ACCOUNTED FOR.
IT'S TERRIFYING.

1588
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
YOU KNOW, THE -- YOU'RE RUSHING

1589
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
OVER HERE, AND YOU CAN'T GET TO

1590
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
WHERE YOU NEED TO GO, AND YOU

1591
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
HAVE TO PARK DOWN HERE, AND
WALK.

1592
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'M GLAD THAT MY SON IS OKAY.

1593
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
HE SEEMS TO BE HANDLING IT

1594
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1595
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I KNOW MY SON'S TEACHERS HAVE

1596
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
BEEN OKAY, AS WELL.

1597
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
BUT I'VE HEARD OTHER TEACHERS

1598
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

1599
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
>> ARE THERE PARENTS THAT STILL

1600
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
DON'T KNOW IF THEIR KIDS ARE

1601
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR?
>> THERE WERE A FEW.

1602
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
THEY ACTUALLY FOUND, I THINK

1603
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
THEY JUST FOUND ONE, THERE WAS A

1604
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
BIG CHEER THAT WENT UP BECAUSE

1605
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THEY FOUND SOMEONE, AND THEY

1606
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
JUST MAY HAVE BEEN NOT, YOU

1607
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
KNOW, NOT AT THE FIREHOUSE.

1608
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>> THE NUMBERS ARE 27 PEOPLE.

1609
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
>> GETS US EVERY TIME WE SEE

1610
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
THAT FATHER PUT HIS HAND TO HIS

1611
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
FACE, STANDING NEXT TO HIS BRAVE

1612
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
LITTLE BOY, JUST TO THE SIDE OF

1613
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
HIM WHO SAID HE WAS JUST GLAD

1614
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
HIS FRIENDS GOT OUT, TOO.

1615
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I HAVE NEW INFORMATION TO BRING

1616
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
ALONG TO YOU, WHICH HELPS TO ADD

1617
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM LIEUTENANT

1618
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
PAUL VANCE THERE A MOMENT AGO

1619
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE

1620
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
THAT SCHOOL.

1621
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT HE SAID IN

1622
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
TWO ROOMS, ONE SECTION OF THE

1623
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
SCHOOL, AND IT'S BELIEVED THAT

1624
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
THAT MOTHER, THE CONNECTION TO

1625
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
THE SUSPECT, OBVIOUSLY, WHO WENT

1626
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
IN TO THAT SCHOOL TODAY, SHE WAS

1627
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
FOUND DEAD.

1628
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
IT'S BELIEVED AND THIS IS

1629
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
CONFIRMED WITH OUR SOURCES AT

1630
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT

1631
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
SHE WAS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

1632
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
AND THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS

1633
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
WHO WERE KILLED WERE IN CLASS

1634
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
WITH HER.
SO SHE WAS KILLED.

1635
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
IT'S BELIEVED MANY OF HER

1636
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
STUDENTS WERE KILLED.

1637
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE SOURCES.

1638
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THE GUNMAN WAS ALSO A STUDENT

1639
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
WHO GREW UP AND WENT TO THAT

1640
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
SCHOOL.

1641
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
WE'LL BE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

1642
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
DYNAMICS OF THIS FAMILY, WHAT

1643
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
POSSIBLY COULD HAVE LED TO THIS,

1644
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF

1645
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THE CLASSROOMS WHERE WE HEAR

1646
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
ABOUT THIS, THE EXTRAORDINARY

1647
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
HORROR OF A TEACHER, A

1648
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, AND ABOUT

1649
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
THE STUDENTS INSIDE THAT CLASS,

1650
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
AND THE PARENTS WHO MET WITH

1651
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY, AND YOU HEARD

1652
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THE LIEUTENANT THERE SAY, PAUL

1653
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
VANCE, SAY THAT THIS MEETING

1654
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS WAS

1655
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT, THAT

1656
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
THIS IS A TRAGIC SCENE.

1657
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
AND WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE AS WE

1658
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
SIT HERE AT A DESK IN NEW YORK

1659
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ABOUT 45 MINUTES AWAY AS THAT

1660
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
ALL UNFOLDS.

1661
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I DO KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE

1662
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
CHRIS COMO THE ANCHOR OF "20/20"

1663
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
IS IN THE REGION, SHADY BROOK,

1664
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
WHICH IS A NEIGHBORING

1665
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
COMMUNITY.
CHRIS, WHAT CAN YOU REPORT?

1666
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
>> WELL, SHADY BROOK IS WHERE

1667
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
THIS COMMUNITY THAT GOES TO THIS

1668
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
TOWN IN NEWTOWN IS FROM.

1669
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
IT'S A VERY SMALL PLACE.

1670
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE'VE BEEN, TODAY, IN A HOME

1671
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THAT HAS BEEN FILLED WITH PEOPLE

1672
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
WHO DON'T KNOW IF THEIR KIDS

1673
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
HAVE MADE IT, WHO FIND OUT THAT

1674
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THEIR KIDS ARE OKAY, AS THEY GO

1675
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
DOWN THERE IN THE THICK OF THE

1676
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
CHAOS TRYING TO FIND THEM AND

1677
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THE PHRASE THAT WE HEARD WAS

1678
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
REALLY RESONATED WAS THAT THIS

1679
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
WAS SOUL SHATTERING WHAT HAS

1680
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HAPPENED HERE.

1681
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT

1682
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
LANZA WILL WIND UP BEING

1683
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
PAINFULLY FAMILIAR TO US, DAVID.

1684
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
PEOPLE WHO BECOME DERANGED AND

1685
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THEY HATCH A PLOT AND THEN THEY

1686
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF MADNESS.

1687
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
BUT WHAT HAS REALLY

1688
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
DISTINGUISHED THIS, WHAT WE'RE

1689
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
REACTING TO, IS WHO THE VICTIMS

1690
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
WERE.

1691
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
THESE KIDS WERE SO YOUNG,

1692
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THERE'S SO MANY YOUNG KIDS

1693
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
INVOLVED.
AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM

1694
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
TODAY.

1695
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
THE BLESSING FOR THEM IS THEIR

1696
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
INNOCENCE.
THAT THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW THE

1697
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
MONSTER THAT WAS IN THEIR MIDST.

1698
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THEY WERE TOLD TO CLOSE THEIR

1699
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
EYES AS THEY WERE RUNNING OUT SO

1700
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SEE THE

1701
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
CARNAGE THAT WAS AROUND THEM.

1702
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WHAT THEY DO REMEMBER ARE THE

1703
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
TEACHERS, THE TEACHERS WHO, WHEN

1704
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THEY HEARD GUNFIRE, DAVID, PUT

1705
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
THESE KIDS IN PROTECTIVE PLACES,

1706
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
STAYED THEIR GROUND AND TOLD

1707
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THEM STORIES.

1708
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
PLAYED GAMES.

1709
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
IN THE MIDST OF THIS MADNESS,

1710
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THAT THEY WERE HEARING, THEY

1711
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
KEPT THEIR COOL, AND THEY GOT

1712
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THEIR KIDS OUT.

1713
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
AND IN A SITUATION THAT IS

1714
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
ALMOST UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE, IT

1715
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
IS AMAZING WHAT THESE TEACHERS

1716
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
DID IN THOSE MOMENTS TO GET

1717
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
THESE KIDS OUT.

1718
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
IT IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

1719
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WHERE AS TERRIBLE AS IT IS, AND

1720
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
IT IS ALMOST UNMITIGATABLE IN

1721
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
ITS HORROR IT COULD HAVE BEEN

1722
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
WORSE WITH THE REPRESENTENRY AND

1723
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
AM NATION PIERRE'S BEEN TELLING

1724
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
US ABOUT THAT WAS BROUGHT BY

1725
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
LANZA TO THE SCHOOL.

1726
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
TO LOOK IN THESE LITTLE KIDS'

1727
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
EYES AND HEAR THEM TELL YOU WHAT

1728
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
THEY HEARD, THAT THEY WERE TAKEN

1729
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
TO SAFETY REALLY BRINGS HOME HOW

1730
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
HORRIBLE THIS WAS.

1731
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BECAUSE OF WHO WAS TARGETED.

1732
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
AND IT'S A DAY THAT THIS

1733
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
COMMUNITY IS NEVER GOING TO

1734
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
FORGET, SO CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS,

1735
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THIS LITTLE GIRL ELLA, FIRST

1736
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
GRADE LIKE MY SON, TOLD ME SHE

1737
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
WENT TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING,

1738
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
WORRIED ABOUT HER CHRISTMAS

1739
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
LIST, WASN'T TOO LONG AND JUST A

1740
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
FEW MINUTES AFTER SHE ARRIVED

1741
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HER DAY BECAME WHAT WE NOW KNOW

1742
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
AS ONE OF THE WORST IN OUR

1743
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

1744
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
>> THAT'S THE THING, CHRIS, SO

1745
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
MANY OF THESE CHILDREN WERE

1746
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
HOPING JUST TO GET THROUGH THESE

1747
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM

1748
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
SCHOOL, WITH THAT INTERNAL

1749
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
COUNTDOWN IN THEIR HEAD, KNOWING

1750
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
JUST HOW MANY DAYS UNTIL SANTA

1751
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
ARRIVES, AND YOU DRIVE THAT

1752
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
POINT HOME, WE HEARD I'M NOT

1753
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SURE IF YOU WERE WITH US

1754
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
EARLIER, CHRIS, BUT WE TALKED

1755
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
ABOUT A FIRST GRADE TEACHER AND

1756
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT SO

1757
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
MANY OF THESE TEACHERS WHO TURN

1758
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
OUT TO BE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY

1759
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD BE

1760
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
APPLAUDED FOR THEIR WORK EVERY

1761
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
DAY IN CLASSROOMS ACROSS

1762
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
AMERICA, BUT PARTICULARLY ON A

1763
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
DAY LIKE TODAY, WHO TOLD

1764
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
REPORTERS AT THE SCENE THAT THE

1765
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
KIDS WERE BEING SO GOOD, THEY

1766
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
SIMPLY ASKED CAN WE GO SEE IF

1767
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
ANYONE ELSE IS OUT THERE?

1768
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR

1769
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
FRIENDS.

1770
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
AND ONE STUDENT SAID, I JUST

1771
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
WANT CHRISTMAS.
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

1772
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I JUST WANT TO HAVE CHRISTMAS.

1773
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
AND THAT FIRST GRADE TEACHER

1774
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
RESPONDED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

1775
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
CHRISTMAS AND HANUKKAH AND SHE

1776
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
SAID, I WAS JUST DETERMINED TO

1777
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
STAY POSITIVE AS SHE LOCKED HER

1778
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
KIDS IN THAT BATHROOM, THAT

1779
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
FIRST GRADE BATHROOM, AND THEN

1780
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
THEY GOT OUT.

1781
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
AS THE DETAILS EMERGE WE CAN

1782
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
TELL YOU THAT THE WEAPONS THE

1783
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
GUNMAN USED, INCLUDED A GLOCK

1784
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUN, A

1785
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUN IN

1786
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
ADDITION TO WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

1787
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
AUTHORITIES ALSO TELL US WERE

1788
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
TWO 23 CALIBER SHELL CASINGS, A

1789
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
RIFLE CALIBER ALSO FOUND AT THE

1790
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
SCENE.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE TOTAL AT

1791
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THIS POINT WERE FOUR WEAPONS,

1792
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
FOUR WEAPONS THAT THAT GUNMAN

1793
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
BROUGHT IN TO THE SCHOOL, AND WE

1794
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
NOW KNOW WENT TO TWO CLASSROOMS

1795
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
IN ONE SECTION OF THE SCHOOL, WE

1796
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
KNOW THAT ONE OF THE CLASSROOMS,

1797
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
IT'S BELIEVED HIS MOTHER IS A

1798
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND IT WAS

1799
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
HER CLASSROOM, THAT SHE DID NOT

1800
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
SURVIVE THIS, NOR DID MANY OF

1801
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THE STUDENTS INSIDE THAT

1802
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
CLASSROOM.

1803
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
AND WE HAVE MADE THIS POINT OVER

1804
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
AND OVER AGAIN, AS WE'VE BEEN ON

1805
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
THE AIR WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE

1806
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
DAY HERE TODAY, IS THAT YOU KNOW

1807
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WHEN THESE THINGS UNFOLD IN

1808
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
THESE SCHOOLS ACROSS AMERICA,
THAT YOU WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY

1809
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
AND THERE'S A DOORWAY INTO A

1810
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
CLASSROOM, AND IF THERE'S

1811
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
SOMEBODY EVIL IN THAT DOORWAY,

1812
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
THERE IS LITTLE A TEACHER CAN DO

1813
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
TO HELP SHIELD HER CHILDREN OR

1814
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
HIS CHILDREN FROM GETTING IN THE

1815
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
WAY OF THAT GUNMAN.

1816
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
SO I WANT TO BRING IN DR. JEN

1817
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
ASHTON WITH OUR MEDICAL TEAM WHO

1818
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
IS WITH ME ON THE DESK.

1819
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
AND WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT THAT,

1820
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THAT SHE WAS A KINDERGARTEN

1821
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
TEACHER.

1822
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
THAT THESE WERE 5-YEAR-OLDS IN

1823
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THAT CLASSROOM, AND THAT THIS

1824
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
SUSPECT WOULD APPEAR AT THE

1825
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
DOOR.

1826
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
IT'S JUST CHILLING.
>> IT'S -- THERE ARE NO WORDS TO

1827
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
DESCRIBE WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN

1828
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
GOING ON ON SO MANY DIFFERENT

1829
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
LEVELS.
YOU KNOW, AS A PARENT, WHAT THE

1830
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
FEAR AND CONFUSION THAT THE

1831
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
CHILDREN WERE EXPERIENCING, WHAT

1832
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
THE TEACHER WAS EXPERIENCING.

1833
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
THE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THE

1834
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
SHOOTER, BY DEFINITION, WAS

1835
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
EXPERIENCING.
AND THEN, THE SHOCKWAVES,

1836
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
LITERALLY, THAT GO OUT, FROM

1837
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
THAT POINT, THAT GROUND ZERO ON,

1838
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
AND LITERALLY THAT THIS POINT,

1839
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
NOW, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

1840
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
ARE BEING FELT THROUGHOUT THE

1841
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
WORLD, WHICH IS, HOW SOMETHING

1842
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN, AND THE

1843
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
ANSWER IS, DAVID, AND WE'VE SEEN

1844
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
IT, UNFORTUNATELY, SO MANY TIMES

1845
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
BEFORE, BUT THIS IS THE FACE OF

1846
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

1847
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS TIME,

1848
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
WE HAVE SO MANY INNOCENT

1849
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
VICTIMS.
BUT OFTENTIMES, THAT'S EXACTLY

1850
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
WHAT WE HAVE, IS INNOCENT
VICTIMS.

1851
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
>> WHAT DO WE SAY TO OUR
CHILDREN TONIGHT, JEN?

1852
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO THINK

1853
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO

1854
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
MY OWN CHILDREN.

1855
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I THINK THAT THE FIRST AND MOST

1856
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
PARAMOUNT TASK OF ANY PARENT IS

1857
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
TO REASSURE THEIR CHILDREN THAT

1858
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
THEY ARE SAFE.

1859
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
YOU WANT THE CONVERSATION TO BE

1860
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
AGE-APPROPRIATE.

1861
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CONVERSATION THAT

1862
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
YOU'LL HAVE WITH A 5-YEAR-OLD

1863
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE

1864
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
CONVERSATION YOU'LL HAVE WITH A

1865
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
15-YEAR-OLD.

1866
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
AND I THINK THAT IT'S VERY

1867
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO EXPLAIN

1868
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT SOMETIMES

1869
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

1870
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
BUT, AS WE'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE

1871
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
IN MANY MENTAL HEALTH

1872
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
PROFESSIONALS SAY, FORTUNATELY

1873
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
IT'S NOT THAT COMMON.

1874
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
AND THEN I THINK IT'S VERY

1875
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
IMPORTANT FOR THE PARENTS AND

1876
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
CHILDREN TO EXPRESS THEIR

1877
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
FEELINGS, TO SAY, I'M SAD, I'M

1878
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
AFRAID, IT'S OKAY IF YOU FEEL

1879
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
THE SAME WAY.

1880
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
AND FROM THAT POINT ON, DAVID, I

1881
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

1882
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
FOR PARENTS TO INVOLVE MENTAL

1883
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AS EARLY AS

1884
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
POSSIBLE.

1885
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
THERE ARE HIGHLY TRAINED AND

1886
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
SKILLED GRIEF COUNSELORS, SOCIAL

1887
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
WORKERS, PSYCHOLOGISTS,

1888
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
PSYCHOTHERAPI

1889
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
PSYCHOTHERAPISTS, PSYCHIATRISTS,

1890
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
CLERGY, THESE PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY

1891
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
TRAINED IN HOW TO TALK TO

1892
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
CHILDREN AT VARIOUS AGES TO GET

1893
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
THEM THROUGH THIS KIND OF

1894
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
TRAUMA.
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS A

1895
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
PROFOUND TRAUMA, NOT JUST FOR

1896
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THOSE CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL,

1897
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
OBVIOUSLY, BUT FOR CHILDREN

1898
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
EVERYWHERE.

1899
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
>> EVERYWHERE WHO ARE WATCHING

1900
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
THESE IMAGES.

1901
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
AS WE KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE

1902
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
IT'S NOT EVEN NETWORK

1903
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
TELEVISION, IT'S THE INTERNET

1904
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
AND THERE'S REALLY NO ESCAPING

1905
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
IT.

1906
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
ALTHOUGH WE ASK PARENTS

1907
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
OBVIOUSLY TO FLIP THE CHANNEL OR

1908
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
MOVE THE KIDS ELSEWHERE IN THE

1909
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
HOUSE AS THEY WATCHED THIS

1910
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
UNFOLD HERE THIS AFTERNOON.

1911
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
ANOTHER PARENT FRONT AND CENTER

1912
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
TODAY WAS THE PRESIDENT.

1913
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1914
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
AND AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE, HE

1915
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
WAS MOST EMOTIONAL IN TALKING

1916
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
ABOUT AN INCIDENT HERE IN

1917
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
AMERICA, GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE

1918
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
IS A FATHER HIMSELF.

1919
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
SASHA AND MALIA AND WE ALL KNOW

1920
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST

1921
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
LADY HAVE WORKED TO KEEP THEIR

1922
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
FAMILY, TO SHIELD THEIR OWN

1923
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
DAUGHTERS FROM THE PUBLIC

1924
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
CAMERAS, AND SO TO LOOK AT THOSE

1925
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
IMAGES TODAY, AND SEE THE FEAR

1926
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
ON THOSE FACES, TO HEAR ABOUT

1927
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, AND

1928
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
THOSE
