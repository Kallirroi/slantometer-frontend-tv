20 LITTLE FLAGS DOT THE CURB

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OUTSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
TEDDY BEARS, ANGELS KEEPING

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
WATCH NEAR THE CENTER OF TOWN

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
AND THE TOWN'S FLAG IN THE

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
CENTRAL OF MAIN STREET AT HALF

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
STAFF.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> THE ONCE JOYFUL CHRISTMAS

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
TREE HAS A DIFFERENT GLOW

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
SURROUNDED BY MEMORIAL CANDLES

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
AND THE LIGHTS OF THE WORLD'S

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
MEDIA.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
THE RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN KNOW IT

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WILL TAKE TIME FOR THIS TOWN TO

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
HEAL BUT THEY ARE ALSO

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
DETERMINED TO SHOW THE WORLD

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
THAT NEWTOWN WILL NOT JUST

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
BECOME ANOTHER WORD FOR TRAGEDY.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
>> THE TOWN RIGHT NOW IS

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
MOURNING.
WE'RE SAD.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I THINK DOWN THE ROAD WE'LL

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
DEFINITELY BE STRONGER.

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
WE HAVE TO BE STRONGER.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
>>> TONIGHT, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
STANDING UP AGAINST GUN

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
VIOLENCE.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
>> THIS IS THE STRAW THAT BREAKS
THE CAMEL'S BACK.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPOND.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
>> TO AN UNPRECEDENTED GATHERING

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
WE THOUGHT AND HOPED WOULD NEVER

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
BE REPEATED.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
TEN FAMILIES FROM THE AURORA

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
SHOOTING, THEY'RE SPEAKING OUT
WITH SOLIDARITY.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
PLUS, DR. ROSS TAKES US INSIDE

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THE MIND OF A KILLER.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT.
HE WAS QUIET.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A NICE KID, A GOOD KID.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
>> HOW THIS TIME IT MAY BE

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
DIFFERENT IN CHANGING THE LAW OF

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
THE LINE.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS
ANYMORE.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>> THIS IS "PIERS MORGAN

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
TONIGHT."

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
>> GOOD EVENING.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
JUST A FEW MINUTES IN THE

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
STUDIO, WE'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH TEN

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AMERICANS WHO LIVED WHAT WE

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
HOPED MIGHT BE THE LAST MASS

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
SHOOTING IN THIS COUNTRY, THE

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
MASSACRE IN A MOVIE HEATER IN

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
AURORA, COLORADO.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
YOU NEED TO HEAR WHAT THESE

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT GUNS IN

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AMERICA.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
>>> BUT FIRST, A PICTURE NONE OF

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
US EVER IMAGINED OR FEARED WE

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
WOULD EVER HAVE TO SEE.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THE FIRST FUNERALS OF THE 20

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED AT THE

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
CONNECTICUT, ON FRIDAY.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
6-YEAR-OLD JACK PINTO WAS LAID

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TO REST TODAY.

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
IN HIS OBITUARY, HIS FAMILY

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WROTE, "JACK WILL FOREVER BE

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
REMEMBERED FOR THE IMMEASURABLE

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
JOY HE BROUGHT TO ALL WHO HAD

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING HIM, A

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
JOY WHOSE WIDE REACH BELIED HIS

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SIX YEARS."

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
HE WAS BURIED IN THE JERSEY OF

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
HIS FAVORITE TEAM MEMBER OF THE

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
NEW YORK GIANTS.

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
HIS FAMILY SAID HE COULD GET

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
WHATEVER HE WANTED JUST BY

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
BATTING HIS LONG EYELASHES.

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LISTEN NOW TO WHAT MAY BE ONE OF

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THE MOST HEARTBREAKING OF ALL IN

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THIS GHASTLY TRAGEDY.

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
PARENTS TALKING ABOUT THE MOMENT

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THEY LEARNED THEIR DAUGHTER HAD

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
DIED IN THE CARNAGE AT SANDY

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HOOK SCHOOL.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
>> SHE WAS A BALL OF FIRE.

89
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
SHE RULED THE ROOST.

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
SHE --

91
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
>> OUR LITTLE CEO, WE CALLED

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HER.

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS THE BOSS.

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> I GOT TO THE FIREHOUSE.

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
>> WE HAD NO IDEA AT THIS POINT.

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WE THOUGHT OKAY, THE REPORTS ARE

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THAT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE MAY HAVE

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
BEEN INJURED.

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> I WALKED AROUND THE
FIREHOUSE.

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
MAYBE SHE IS IN.

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THIS MAYBE SHE IS THERE.

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
>> I MUST HAVE DONE 100 LAPS.

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WEARING.
I WAS GOING TO SEE HER LITTLE

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
PONYTAIL COME AROUND THE CORNER

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
AND HER JACKET AND HER BLACK

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
GLITTERY UGGS THAT SHE HAD ON

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THAT MORNING.

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THEY FINALLY AROUND 1:15 ASKED

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN, AND THEY

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SAID THAT IT WAS A TRAGIC DAY IN

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
NEWTOWN TODAY, AND 20 CHILDREN

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WERE KILLED.

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
AND -- TELL ME THAT MY LITTLE

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
GIRL WAS GONE.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
>> THERE WAS SO MUCH PAIN AND

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
CONFUSION WHEN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS MADE.

118
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THE LIFE WAS JUST SUCKED OUT OF

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.

120
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST

121
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
POINT-BLANK FOUND A STATE

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TROOPER AND ARE THERE ANY
SURVIVORS?

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT STANDING

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
HERE AS A PARENT, MY CHILD IS
GONE?

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AND HE SAID YES.

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
>> THE BED SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OUT OF.

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AND WE JUST STAYED IN BED.

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
IT'S STILL NOT REAL THAT MY --

130
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
MY LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS SO FULL

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OF LIFE AND WHO WANTS A HORSE SO

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
BADLY AND WHO IS GOING TO GET

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
COWGIRL BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS

134
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ISN'T COMING HOME.

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> SO MANY AWFUL, AWFUL ACCOUNTS

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OF THIS APPALLING TRAGEDY.

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
WHAT WILL AMERICA DO ABOUT GUNS?

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
JOINING ME NOW IS SENATOR DIANNE

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
FEINSTEIN.

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
SHE IS INTRODUCING AN ASSAULT

141
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WEAPONS BAN WHEN CONGRESS

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
RECONVENES IN JANUARY.

143
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IT'S ALMOST TOO MUCH TO BEAR,

144
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ISN'T IT, LISTENING?

145
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> YES, IT IS.
IT'S VERY HARD.

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO IF

147
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
IT WERE MY DAUGHTER.

148
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I JUST -- THIS IS SO BAD.

149
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IT IS SO HORRIFIC.

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
YOU KNOW, ONE POINT YOU FEEL

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THIS TERRIBLE GRIEF, AND THEN

152
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
YOU FEEL THIS ANGER THAT THIS

153
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
COULD HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY,

154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
WHERE CHILDREN SHOULD BE AT

155
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
LEAST SAFE IN A SCHOOL.

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ANYWAY, YES, I'M GOING TO DO AN

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS PIECE OF

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
LEGISLATION.

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG, AND

160
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
IT'S GOING TO BE DEFINITIVE.

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BAN BY NAME AT

162
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
LEAST 100 MILITARY-STYLE

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS.

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BAN BIG CLIPS,

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DRUMS OR STRIPS OF MORE THAN TEN
BULLETS.

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND IT'S THIS PARTICULAR

167
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
CATEGORY OF WEAPON WHICH THE

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
BUSHMASTER IS.

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
IT'S A KILLER WEAPON.

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
YOU CAN FIRE IT VERY QUICKLY.

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
IT HAS VERY LITTLE RECOIL, VERY

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
LITTLE KICK, AND IT'S VERY HIGH

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
VELOCITY.

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG ON THE

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
STREETS OF OUR CITY.

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG IN A PLACE

177
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WHERE A 20-YEAR-OLD LIKE THIS

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PARTICULAR 20-YEAR-OLD COULD GET

179
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AHOLD OF IT AND GO IN AND DO

180
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WHAT HE DID.

181
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AND THIS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY.

182
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO

183
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SAY I HAVE MY SECOND AMENDMENT

184
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
RIGHTS.

185
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'M ENTITLED TO BEAR ARMS.

186
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO TAKE

187
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AWAY THAT RIGHT BY REMOVING

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THESE KIND OF WEAPONS FROM THE

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
STREETS AND FROM THE STORES.

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> THERE IS NO SECOND AMENDMENT

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
RIGHT TO BEAR EVERY TYPE OF

192
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WEAPON THAT YOU KNOW OF.

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THESE ARE A CERTAIN CLASS OF
WEAPONS.

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THEY ARE DESIGNED TO KILL LARGE

195
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN CLOSE
COMBAT.

196
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THE SECOND

197
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AMENDMENT COVERS THEM.

198
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A LONG TIME BEFORE THESE -- THIS

200
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
CLASS OF WEAPONS WAS FOUNDED,

201
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
MERCHANDISED, AND SPREAD ALL

202
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
OVER OUR COUNTRY.

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE HANDS

204
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OF JUVENILES, GRIEVANCE KILLERS,

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
PEOPLE WHO GO INTO OUR MALLS,

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OUR THEATERS, OUR STORES, OUR

207
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
BUSINESSES, AND NOW OUR SCHOOLS

208
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
AND JUST KILL PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD

209
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
REASON.

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE REACTION

212
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU'VE HAD ALREADY FROM OTHER
POLITICIANS.

213
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ANY GUN

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
SUPPORTING POLITICIAN ON THE
SHOW.

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND LIKE MOST SHOWS ON AMERICAN

216
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T

217
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WANT TO COME ON.

218
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THEY'RE HIDING AWAY, AS ARE

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
MEMBERS OF THE NRA AND ALL THE

220
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
USUAL SUSPECTS WHEN THESE

221
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.

222
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
ARE YOU DETECTING, SENATOR, THAT

223
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THERE IS CHANGE IN MOOD?

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
ARE YOU HOPING THIS IS A TIPPING

225
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
POINT?

226
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> YES, I HOPE SO, PIERS.

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I HAD TO DO A BRIEF SEGMENT ON

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
"MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY

229
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
MORNING.

230
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND AFTERWARDS, I PROBABLY GOT

231
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
20 PHONE CALLS AT HOME HERE IN
WASHINGTON.

232
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
VERY UNUSUAL, PEOPLE FROM

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA

234
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
CALLING AND SAYING WE WANT TO

235
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HELP WITH THIS.

236
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

237
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I EVEN HAD ONE MAN WHO WAS A

238
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MEMBER OF THE NRA WHO SAID I

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HAVE AN AR-15, AND I'M GOING TO

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
GET RID OF IT.

241
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'M A HUNTER, AND I WANT YOU TO

242
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE ASSAULT

243
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WEAPONS.

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SO I'M GOING TO DO MY LEVEL BEST

245
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
TO TRY.

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE IN 1993.

247
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WE SAT DOWN AND WE WROTE A BILL,

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
AND THAT BILL PASSED THE SENATE.

249
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
CHUCK SCHUMER INTRODUCED IT IN

250
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THE HOUSE.

251
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
IT PASSED.

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
IT WAS NOT AMENDED.

253
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
IT WAS PASSED.

254
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AND IT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT.

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED IT, AND

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT WAS THE LAW FOR TEN YEARS.

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
AND OVER TIME, IT BEGAN TO WIND

258
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
DOWN THE SUPPLY OF THESE
WEAPONS.

259
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
AND PARTICULARLY THE CLIPS,

260
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
DRUMS, OR STRIPS OF OVER 100

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
BULLETS.

262
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE

263
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
PERSON THAT WENT INTO THAT

264
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HEATER IN AURORA HAD A DRUM WITH

265
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
100 BULLETS IN HIS ASSAULT

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WEAPON.

267
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
FORTUNATELY, THAT DRUM JAMMED OR

268
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ELSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD 100 CLEAR

269
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SHOTS AT PEOPLE SITTING IN SEATS

270
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
IN A MOVIE THEATER.

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
NOW, HERE YOU PROBABLY HAD THIS

272
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MAN FIRE MORE THAN 100 BULLETS.

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I MEAN, WE'VE JUST HEARD WHERE

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
NO CHILD HAD LESS THAN THREE

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
BULLETS IN THEM OF WHAT IS A

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
KILLER WEAPON THAT SHOULDN'T BE

277
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITY.

278
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
AND NOW THESE CHILDREN, THIS IS

279
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE

280
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CAMEL'S BACK.

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPOND.

282
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
RIGHTS OF THE MANY TO REMAIN

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SAFE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY

285
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
RIGHT YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE TO

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HAVE A MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT

287
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WEAPON.

288
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I APPLAUD

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I WISH YOU

290
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
EVERY SUCCESS.

291
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> THANK YOU.

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THANK YOU, PIERS, I APPRECIATE

293
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
IT.

294
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
>>> MY NEXT GUEST IS A GUN

295
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
RIGHTS ADVOCATE.

296
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HE SAYS THE BUSHMASTER

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, THE TYPE OF

298
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
RIFLE ADAM LANZA USED TO KILL 20

299
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
CHILDREN AND SIX MORE ADULTS

300
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
SAYS, QUOTE IS A BLAST TO SHOOT

301
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WITH.

302
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

303
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
VIRGINIA CITIZENS DEFENSE

304
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
LEAGUE.

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I WANT TO READ WHAT YOU SAID ON

306
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SUNDAY TO THE "WASHINGTON POST."

307
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
YOU SAID I COULD ASK YOU WHEN

308
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
ASKED ABOUT THE USE OF THESE

309
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
TYPE OF WEAPONS WHY SHOULD

310
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
ANYONE WANT A FERRARI?

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BUSHMASTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY A
BLAST TO SHOOT WITH.

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THEY'RE FAST.

313
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THEY'RE ACCURATE.

314
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
GUNS ARE FUN.

315
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SOME OF THEM ARE MUCH MORE COOL

316
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THAN OTHERS.

317
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
IT'S JUST LIKE WE HAVE

318
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
TELEVISION SETS THAT LOOK COOL

319
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AND OTHERS ARE MUCH MORE BOXY.

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ARE YOU PROUD OF WHAT YOU SAID?

321
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> IT'S JUST A FACT.

322
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIREARMS.

323
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
PEOPLE -- I'M AN INSTRUCTOR.

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AND WHEN I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO

325
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SHOOT, YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR FACE

326
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
LIGHT UP THE FIRST TIME THEY

327
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SHOOT A FIREARM.

328
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY EXPECTED.

329
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
IT IS A LOT OF FUN.

330
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IT'S THE NATURE OF GUNS.

331
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
IT'S BEEN A PART OF OUR COUNTRY

332
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
FOR 250 YEARS.

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS A TIME

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
TO THINK ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN

335
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WHEN 20 CHILDREN AGED 5 YEARS

336
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
OLD ARE BEING BLOWN TO PIECES BY

337
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A WEAPON THAT IS FREELY

338
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY?

339
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>> WELL, YOU NEED TO ASK THE

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
REPORTER, BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE

341
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THAT APPROACHED ME WITH THE
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS.

342
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I SIMPLY ANSWERED THEM.

343
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO

344
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
UNDERSTAND.

345
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
HE WAS NOT A GUN PERSON, DIDN'T

346
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.

347
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SO I WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

348
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
>> WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND BE

349
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HELPFUL AND EDUCATE ME.

350
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WHY DOES ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHO

351
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
IS NOT IN THE MILITARY OR THE

352
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
POLICE FORCE NEED A

353
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON THAT CAN

354
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
UNLEASH HUNDREDS OF SHOTS IN A

355
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES AND

356
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT AMERICANS?

357
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> WE DO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
MACHINE GUN.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.

359
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> I DIDN'T --

360
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MACHINE

361
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
GUNS.
>> I UNDERSTAND VERY CAREFULLY.

362
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
MY BROTHER IS A BRITISH COLONEL.

363
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I KNOW WHAT WEAPONS ARE.

364
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
IT'S A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

365
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
IT'S THE SAME RIFLE THAT WAS

366
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
USED IN AURORA.

367
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AND I HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE

368
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
AFFECTED BY THAT TONIGHT WITH ME

369
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
TONIGHT LIVE AFTER THIS.

370
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
AND ALSO IN THE OREGON SHOPPING

371
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
MALL SHOOTING.

372
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MACHINE

373
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
CAN DO.

374
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT DID TO

375
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THESE CHILDREN.

376
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU

377
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

378
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
WEAPON AND THE TYPE OF WEAPONS

379
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
LIKE IT SHOULD BE FREELY

380
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
AVAILABLE TO AMERICANS WHEN THEY

381
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
ARE BEING USED FOR A SERIES, AND

382
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
IT ACCEPT DEEM MICK NOW.

383
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SIX OF THE WORST MASS SHOOTINGS

384
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
IN AMERICAN SHOOTINGS HAVE

385
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
OCCURRED SINCE 2007.

386
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
WHY YOU PERSIST IN WANTING THIS

387
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
TO BE FREELY AVAILABLE TO
AMERICANS.

388
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> WELL, AUTOMOBILES KILL MORE

389
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS THAN GUNS

390
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
DO, BUT WE DON'T SAY WE

391
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE SOME

392
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
MANIAC THAT IS DRUNK ENDS UP

393
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
DRIVING A CAR INTO A FAMILY AND

394
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
KILLING THEM.

395
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THIS WAS A MISUSE OF SOMETHING

396
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
BY CLEARLY SOMEBODY THAT WAS

397
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

398
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WHY SHOULD THEN THE REST OF THE

399
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
COUNTRY WITH THE HUNDREDS OF

400
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
MILLIONS OF GUNOWNERS IN AMERICA

401
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG

402
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WITH THEIR GUNS, WHY ARE WE

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
TURNING THEM, AS IF THIS WAS

404
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THEIR FAULT?
THIS IS NOT THEIR FAULT.

405
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
THIS WAS A MANIAC IN A STATE

406
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THAT HAD A LOT OF GUN CONTROL IN

407
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A GUN-FREE ZONE THAT IGNORED

408
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
EVERY LAW THERE WAS AND MURDERED

409
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
ALL THOSE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

410
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
>> DO YOU WANT ANY MORE FORM OF

411
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
GUN CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY?

412
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
YOU'RE QUITE HAPPY WITH WHERE

413
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THINGS ARE?

414
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

415
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
CRIME HAS BEEN FALLING IN

416
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
AMERICA.

417
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
IN FACT, SINCE THE ASSAULT

418
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
WEAPON BAN THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE

419
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
YEARS AGO BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN,

420
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
EVEN WHEN AFTER THAT EXPIRED,

421
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
OUR CRIME RATES CONTINUED TO GO
DOWN IN AMERICA.

422
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IS DOWN.

423
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN DIDN'T

424
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
DO --

425
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE GET KILLED

426
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WITH GUNS, GET MURDERED WITH

427
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
GUNS A YEAR IN YOUR COUNTRY?

428
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
DO YOU KNOW?

429
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
>> WELL, MOST OF IT IS EITHER

430
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
SUICIDES OR CRIMINAL-ON-CRIMINAL

431
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SHOOTINGS.

432
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> THAT WASN'T WHAT I ASKED YOU.

433
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

434
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
>> SOMEWHERE 20,000 --

435
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT
SUICIDES.

436
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I ASKED YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE

437
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS IN AMERICA ON

438
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
AVERAGE IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE

439
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
YEARS.

440
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DO YOU KNOW THAT FIGURE?

441
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
>> I DON'T BECAUSE THE FBI

442
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
CLUMPS IT TOGETHER WITH
SUICIDES.

443
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
>> THEY DON'T, ACTUALLY.

444
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND.

445
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IT'S ABOUT 11,000 TO 12,000.

446
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY --

447
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT NUMBER.

448
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
THAT MAKES SENSE.

449
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ON

450
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AVERAGE GET KILLED IN BRITAIN OR

451
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
GERMANY OR AUSTRALIA?

452
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
AND I PARTICULARLY MENTION

453
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE

454
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
IN 1996 WE HAD A VERY SIMILAR

455
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ATTACK IN DUNBLANE IN SCOTLAND

456
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THAT KILLED 16 YOUNG CHILDREN.

457
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WE INSTITUTED A HANDGUN BAN.

458
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
IN AUSTRALIA THEY WENT FURTHER.

459
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
THEY HAD A GOVERNOR INITIATIVE

460
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
TO BRING BACK GUNS.

461
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THEY WOULD GIVE PEOPLE MONEY IN

462
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
RETURN FOR THE GUNS.

463
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
THEY BANNED ASSAULT WEAPONS OF

464
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THE TYPE YOU'RE SEEING HERE

465
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
CAUSING THIS TRAGEDY.

466
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
AND GUESS WHAT?

467
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MORE

468
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN,

469
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
IN DUNBLANE SINCE THAT BAN CAME

470
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
IN.

471
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO MASS

472
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
SHOOTING IN AUSTRALIA WHATSOEVER

473
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SINCE 1996.

474
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
AND I SAY TO YOU --
>> THE CRIME RATES OF GUNS HAVE

475
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
DOUBLED.

476
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>> I SAY TO YOU AGAIN, THIS

477
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
STATISTIC OF 11,000 TO 12,000

478
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
MURDERS FROM GUNS, IT IS WAY,

479
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WAY AHEAD OF ANY OF THE

480
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF THIS

481
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
WORLD.

482
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
IT IS A DISGRACE TO AMERICA AND

483
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IT'S

484
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
CONTINUED TO HAPPEN.

485
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AND THE REASONS IT HAPPENS, AND

486
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I SAY THIS WITH RESPECT TO YOU,

487
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
IS YOUR FACETIOUS ATTITUDE

488
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
COMPARING IT TO CARS.

489
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER 20

490
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
CHILDREN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES,

491
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
YOU STILL SEE NO PROBLEM IN THIS

492
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
RIDICULOUS ASSAULT WEAPON BEING

493
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
FREELY AVAILABLE ON THE STREETS

494
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND THAT MAY BE

495
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A LOAD OF OTHER DERANGED YOUNG

496
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
MEN WHO WANT TO MAKE A NAME FOR

497
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THEMSELVES WHO CAN JUST GO AND

498
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
GET ONE AND FIND IT EASIER TO

499
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
BUY ONE THAT IT IS TO BUY A PET.

500
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THIS IS SHAMEFUL TO AMERICA.

501
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE ALLOWING

502
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
IT TO CONTINUE.

503
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GUNS

504
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
BEING FUN ON ABOUT THIS BEING

505
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS, I SAY TO

506
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
YOU THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK

507
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN.

508
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
>> WELL, TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT
THAT.

509
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHING

510
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THAT ISSUE, ASKING THESE KINDS

511
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
OF QUESTIONS.

512
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
IF YOU THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE

513
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TALK TO

514
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
SOME OF YOUR FELLOW PEOPLE IN

515
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THE PRESS.

516
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE
YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

517
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'M TRYING TO ANSWER THEM.

518
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> THE DAY AFTER 20 CHILDREN ARE

519
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
MURDERED TO COMPARE THESE GUNS
TO FERRARIS.

520
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> HE ASKED ME A SERIES OF
QUESTIONS.

521
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
MOST DIDN'T GO ON THERE.

522
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
>> YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS.

523
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE WORDS INTO

524
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
YOUR MOUTH.
>> NO.

525
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> AND I ASKED YOU TODAY IF YOU

526
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
WERE PROUD OF THEM, AND YOU
STOOD BY IT.

527
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
YOU SAID IT IS THE TRUTH.

528
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
>> IT IS THE TRUTH.

529
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

530
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS SHOULDN'T

531
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
BE SILENCING --

532
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TRUTH.

533
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
IT'S ABOUT THIS, SIR, WITH
REPRESENT.

534
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT.

535
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BILL OF

536
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
RIGHTS THERE ARE ALREADY

537
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROLS IN THIS

538
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
COUNTRY, EXTENSIVE.

539
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT

540
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
REACTING TO AN APPALLING

541
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
TRAGEDY, THE LIKE OF WHICH

542
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
AMERICA HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

543
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, THERE

544
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
HAS BEEN THE WORST EVER SINGLE

545
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
SHOOTING IN AURORA, 70 PEOPLE

546
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
SHOT.

547
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THERE HAS BEEN THE WORST EVER

548
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING, 20 CHILDREN

549
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AGED 5 YEARS OLD.

550
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
AND AMERICA --

551
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
>> THEY HAPPENED IN GUN-FREE

552
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
ZONES.

553

558

IT HAPPENED WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T

559

560
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000

561
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THAT IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

562
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THEATER WAS ARMED, THEY WOULD

563
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
HAVE ALL STOOD UP --

564
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
>> NOT EVERYONE.

565
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> HOW MANY DO YOU WANT TO BE

566
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ARMED IN THAT MOVIE THEATER?

567
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
>> I BELIEVE SOMEBODY FIRING AT

568
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
HIM WOULD HAVE SLOWED HIM DOWN

569
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
OR POSSIBLY STOPPED HIM, YES.

570
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
>> YOU'RE AWARE OF THE
SHOOTING --

571
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
>> NOT BEEN ABLE TO CARRY THEM

572
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OUT.

573
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> YOU'RE AWARE OF THE SHOOTING

574
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
IN NEW YORK RECENTLY WHERE

575
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
POLICE FIRED, AND THESE ARE

576
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000

578
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
EIGHT PEOPLE.

579
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
YOU WERE AWARE OF THAT.

580
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
THEY WERE POLICE OFFICERS.

581
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
>> I WAS A DEPUTY SHERIFF.

582
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE

583
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THAN YOU

584
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
DO.
>> REALLY?

585
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
>> AND THE HIGHLY -- YES.

586
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
>> YOU EXPLAIN TO ME, THEN.

587
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
>> PATROL OFFICER IS NOT WHAT

588
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
YOU THINK IT IS.

589
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU

590
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THINK ARMING EVERY MOVIE

591
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
THEATER, SHOPPING MALL, AND

592
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN YOU

593
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
ALREADY HAVE 300 MILLION GUNS IS

594
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
GOING TO HELP THIS APPALLING

595
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CULTURE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN

596
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AMERICA.

597
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
YOU TELL ME.

598
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> OKAY.

599
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> EVEN AS I SPEAK.
>> OKAY.

600
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU GUN SALES WILL

601
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
BE RISING IN CONNECTICUT BECAUSE

602
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

603
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
PEOPLE WILL BE SAYING I'VE GOT

604
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
TO ARM MYSELF.

605
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
AND EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS, MORE

606
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
GUNS GET INTO CIRCULATION, AND

607
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
MORE OF THESE OUTRAGES HAPPEN.

608
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
AND AT SOME POINT, YOU AND YOUR

609
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORT NO EXTRA

610
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
GUN CONTROL ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

611
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.

612
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> ACTUALLY FEINSTEIN'S BILL

613
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WHEN SHE PUTS THAT IN, YOU'RE

614
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
GOING TO SEE A RISE IN ASSAULT

615
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
WEAPONS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED.

616
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
SO IT'S GOING TO WORK JUST THE

617
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE WANTS.

618
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
GUN CONTROL NEVER WORK.

619
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
IT FAILS EVERYWHERE IT IS TRIED.

620
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
AND THIS WILL JUST BE ANOTHER

621
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EXAMPLE IF SHE EVER DOES GET IT

622
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
PASSED.

623
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> I ALREADY SAID TO YOU GUN

624
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
CONTROL HAS WORKED VERY

625
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SUCCESSFULLY IN BRITAIN, IN

626
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
AUSTRALIA, IN JAPAN.

627
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
JAPAN HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN

628
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
CONTROL IN THE WORLD.

629
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THEY HAVE TWO OR THREE MURDERS A

630
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
YEAR.

631
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
YOU HAVE 11,000 TO 12,000 --

632
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
>> HOW MANY SUICIDES DO THEY

633
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HAVE?

634
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000

GUNS A YEAR IN AMERICA.

636

YOU?

638
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000

639
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
THAN THEY ARE IN AMERICA.

640
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
THEY DON'T USE GUNS.

641
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF WAYS TO

642
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
KILL THEMSELVES.

643
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
AND YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CULTURE
IN ENGLAND.

644
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WHAT HAS HURT THIS COUNTRY IS
THE DRUGS.

645
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
THE DRUGS HAVE CHANGED

646
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
EVERYTHING.

647
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THESE

648
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
SHOOTINGS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP

649
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
IN THE '50s AND '60s.

650
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T NEED A
BACKGROUND CHECK TO BUY A GUN.

651
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
NOW WITH ALL THE DRUGS, ALL THE

652
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
STUFF WE'RE TREATING KIDS WITH

653
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000

654
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
CAUSING SOME REAL PROBLEMS IN

656
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
ALMOST ALL OF THESE KIDS THAT

657
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
HAVE MURDERED, IF YOU LOOK AT

658
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THEM, THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED

659
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WITH DRUGS FOR THEIR MENTAL
PROBLEMS.

660
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND IT'S CHANGING SOMETHING.

661
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
IT'S TAKING AWAY THEIR EMPATHY

662
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
WHERE THEY CAN DO THIS KIND OF

663
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
HORRIBLE THING AND NOT FEEL

664
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
REMORSE OR FEAR OR TERROR OF

665
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000

666
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> I THINK IT'S A MULTITUDE OF
THINGS, PIERS.

737
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
IT'S REASONABLE GUN CONTROL.

738
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
IT'S LOOKING AT EMOTIONAL

739
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
INSTABILITY.

740
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
IT'S EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR

741
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEING.

742
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
IT REALLY IS A MULTITUDE OF
THINGS.

743
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
>> IN RELATION TO THE DEBATE

744
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL, IT SEEMS TO

745
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
BE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED NOW ON

746
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
THESE SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES AND

747
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
THE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

748
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A BAN ON

749
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS, AS SENATOR

750
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
FEINSTEIN IS TRYING TO PUSH
THROUGH?

751
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
>> YES, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD.

752
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
>> YOU THINK THE AMERICAN --

753
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
>> I THINK MOST OF OUR

754
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
COMMUNITY -- EXCUSE ME.
>> NO, PLEASE.

755
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
AFTER YOU.

756
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
>> I THINK MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY
IS ON BOARD.

757
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I JUST CAME FROM A MEETING, AND

758
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT AN

759
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
IMMEDIATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

760
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
STARTING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

761
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> HOW IS YOUR DAUGHTER?
SHE HAS LOST THREE OF HER

762
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
FRIENDS.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY

763
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TRAUMATIC FOR HER.

764
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
>> WELL, SHE WASN'T CLOSE WITH

765
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO
DIFFERENT IN AGE.

766
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
BUT THEY ARE FROM HER DANCE

767
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
STUDIO.

768
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
BUT WE HAVE THREE DEATHS WITHIN

769
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

770
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THE SHOOTER LIVED WITHIN MY

771
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

772
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WE LOST OUR FORMER BABY-SITTER,

773
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
LOST HER MOTHER.

774
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SO IT'S ON MULTIPLE FRONTS.

775
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THE
COMMUNITY IS DOING THERE?

776
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> THEY'RE VERY STRONG.

777
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER.

778
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
IT'S REALLY -- THESE LAST TWO

779
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
DAYS HAVE BEEN A HORROR.

780
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS.

781
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVED TO DO

782
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SOMETHING AND TO BE CALLED TO

783
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
ACTION.

784
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.

785
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
>> AND AS PEOPLE ARE WATCHING

786
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THIS AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY

787
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
CAN HELP, WHAT IS THE BEST WAY

788
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF NEWTOWN TO

789
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
CONTRIBUTE?

790
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
>> WELL, TO CONTRIBUTE I THINK

791
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE IT'S

792
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
REALLY ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, IF

793
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
IT'S ONLY NEWTOWN THAT GOES

794
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THROUGH THESE CHANGES AND TRIES

795
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
TO EFFECT THESE THINGS, THAT'S

796
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
ONE SMALL PART.

797
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
WE ALL HAVE TO -- EVERY

798
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
COMMUNITY IN THIS NATION NEEDS

799
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN

800
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
HAPPEN IF WE HAVE PROLIFERATION

801
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
OF GUNS AND EMOTIONAL

802
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
INSTABILITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY,

803
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THIS CAN HAPPEN.

804
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND WE NEED ALL COMMUNITIES,

805
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BASICALLY, TO RALLY THEIR LOCAL

806
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
AND STATE GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL

807
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
GOVERNMENT, AND GET OUR ELECTED

808
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
OFFICIALS TO HAVE THE MORAL

809
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
COURAGE TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH

810
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
OTHER AND HAVE COMMON SENSE

811
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DISCUSSIONS AND LISTEN TO EACH

812
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
OTHER AND LISTEN TO THEIR POINTS

813
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
AND FIND SOME MIDDLE COMMON

814
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
GROUND.

815
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
>> LEE SHULL, THANK YOU VERY

816
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.

817
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I DO APPRECIATE IT.

818
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
>> THANK YOU.

819
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
>> NOW I WANT TO BRING IN MY

820
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SPECIAL GUESTS HERE IN THE

821
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
STUDIO, LOVED ONES OF THE

822
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
VICTIMS OF THE AURORA, COLORADO,

823
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SHOOTING, AND A SURVIVOR.

824
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
WELCOME TO YOU ALL.

825
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
EVEN WHEN I'VE TALKED TO YOU IN

826
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OUR GREEN ROOM, A LOT OF

827
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
EMOTION, A LOT OF ANGER, A LOT

828
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
OF GREAT SADNESS.

829
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW

830
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
YOU'VE ALL BEEN HEARING THAT SO

831
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

832
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
AURORA, ARGUABLY AN EVEN WORSE

833
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
TRAGEDY.

834
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
20 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN BLOWN TO

835
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
PIECES.

836
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
STEPHEN, LET ME START WITH THAT.

837
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
YOU WERE A VICTIM IN AURORA.

838
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
YOU WERE SHOT.

839
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
HOW YOU DOING PHYSICALLY, FIRST

840
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
OF ALL?

841
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
>> I'M SLOWLY RECOVERING.

842
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SOME NERVE DAMAGE IN MY LEFT

843
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
ARM.

844
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, DOING

845
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
REALLY WELL.

846
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
>> IT'S NEARLY FIVE MONTHS TO

847
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THE DAY SINCE THE MASSACRE IN

848
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THAT MOVIE THEATER.

849
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND WE SEE THIS INCIDENT
HAPPENING IN NEWTOWN.

850
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
IT'S JUST BEYOND GROTESQUE.

851
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS WHEN YOU

852
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
HEARD OF HAD HAPPENED COMING TO

853
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

854
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
>> YEAH, I SAW THE INITIAL

855
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
REPORTS LIKE EVERYONE DID, THAT

856
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
MAYBE JUST THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN

857
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
KILLED.

858
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT WAS 27
PEOPLE MURDERED.

859
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
AND GROWING UP, HAVING GROWN UP

860
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
TEN MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD FROM

861
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THAT COMMUNITY, I COULDN'T

862
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
BELIEVE THAT ONCE AGAIN MY LIFE

863
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WAS GOING TO BE AFFECTED IN THIS

864
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WAY BY SUCH HORRIBLE VIOLENCE.

865
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
>> YOU ACTUALLY LIVE LITERALLY

866
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
TEN MINUTES AWAY?

867
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
>> RIGHT.

868
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP MY WHOLE

869
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
LIFE.

870
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
>> WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT

871
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AMERICA THAT YOU'RE ATTACKED IN

872
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
A MOVIE THEATER BY A YOUNG MAN

873
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
WITH AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE AND

874
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THEN TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM WHERE

875
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
YOU LIVE, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

876
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
IS SHOT UP WITH A YOUNG MAN WITH

877
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
EXACTLY THE SAME WEAPON?

878
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
>> IT'S CERTAINLY DISCOURAGING

879
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
IN SOME SENSE.

880
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAME AFTER

881
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AURORA AND WHAT IS COMING AFTER

882
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
THIS HORRIBLE EVENT IS COMMUNITY

883
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
COMING TOGETHER, BANDING

884
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
TOGETHER IN AN INCREDIBLY

885
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
POSITIVE WAY.

886
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
AND I MEAN, THE SUPPORT I

887
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
RECEIVED FROM STRANGERS AFTER

888
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
AURORA IS AMAZING.

889
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AND IT'S CLEAR IN SANDY HOOK THE

890
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
SAME THING IS HAPPENING THERE.

891
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
>> THERESA AND DAVE, LET ME

892
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
RETURN TO YOU.

893
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
A.J. BOIK WAS YOUR SON.

894
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
HE WAS YOUR NEPHEW, DAVE.

895
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

896
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
STATES SAID LAST NIGHT THAT

897
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THERE ARE FOUR OUTRAGES NOW ON

898
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
HIS WATCH INVOLVING MASS
SHOOTINGS.

899
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
HE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

900
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I KNOW YOU MET WITH THE

901
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
PRESIDENT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

902
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
AURORA.

903
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU THEN,

904
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
DAVE, AND WHAT HAPPENED?

905
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
>> WE WERE ALL GATHERED IN

906
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
AURORA, AND WE WERE SITTING IN

907
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THE ROOM, WAITING FOR THE

908
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
PRESIDENT TO ARRIVE.

909
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
AND HE WALKED IN AND GRACIOUS.

910
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE MEETING.

911
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
BUT HE STARTED IT OUT WITH I'M

912
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
NOT HERE AS THE PRESIDENT.

913
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'M HERE AS A FATHER.

914
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'M HERE AS A PARENT.

915
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
MY CHILDREN GO TO THE MOVIES.

916
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

917
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
WE NEED TO BE HOLDING OUR

918
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE.

919
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
WE NEED TO MAKE POSITIVE CHANGE

920
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
BECAUSE IT'S TOO LATE FOR A.J.,

921
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
BUT THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN

922
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
THROUGHOUT THAT ARE GOING TO BE

923
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
AFFECTED IF WE DON'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

924
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
AND TO THROW OUR HANDS UP AND TO

925
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
WALK AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE IS

926
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
LIKE SAYING IT'S OKAY THAT THIS

927
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
HAPPENED.
WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING

928
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
ELSE ABOUT IT.

929
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
WE CAN'T CHANGE IT.

930
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
WELL, THAT'S GARBAGE.

931
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS

932
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

933
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
OUR COMMUNITY BACK.

934
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORLD BACK.

935
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
AND WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE.

936
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT

937
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
SAY IT'S ILLEGAL TO STEAL.

938
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
BUT GUESS WHAT?

939
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
THOSE LAWS ARE STILL THERE

940
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE

941
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
BEHAVIOR.

942
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

943
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
WITH GUNS.

944
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE.

945
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WE DON'T NEED THIS INDIVIDUAL TO

946
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
HAVE A GUN.

947
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
WE DON'T NEED -- WE NEED TO HAVE

948
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS DONE ON

949
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
EVERYBODY THAT PURCHASES A

950
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
FIREARM SO THAT WE CAN STOP

951
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING

952
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THE GUNS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT

953
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
FOR THEM TO GET THESE WEAPONS,

954
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

955
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
TIME BEFORE THIS WREAKS HAVOC

956
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
AGAIN.

957
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
>> THERESA, THIS WAS YOUR BOY.
HE WAS 18.

958
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
>> YES.

959
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE

960
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
PARENTS IN SANDY HOOK NOW WHO

961
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
ARE TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH

962
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THIS?

963
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
>> WE ARE BEHIND THEM 100%.

964
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WE KNOW EXACTLY

965
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

966
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
IT'S A TERRIBLE CLUB.

967
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
BUT IT'S -- IT'S THE HARDEST

968
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
THING YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GO

969
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THROUGH.

970
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
AND YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE TO

971
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
HAVE FAITH AND PUSH YOUR -- PUSH

972
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
YOUR -- PUSH THIS LEGISLATION

973
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THROUGH.

974
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
YOU GOT TO CALL YOUR CONGRESS.

975
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
YOU GOT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW.

976
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
SCREAM IT FROM THE HILLS.

977
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

978
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
COLUMBINE SHOULDN'T HAVE

979
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
HAPPENED.

980
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
AURORA SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

981
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
VIRGINIA TECH SHOULDN'T HAVE

982
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HAPPENED.

983
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
AND GOD FORBID THIS SHOULDN'T

984
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
HAVE HAPPENED EITHER AT SANDY

985
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
HOOK.

986
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
IT SHOULD NOT.

987
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
>> AND CAREN, YOUR SON ALEX, HE

988
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
WAS 24.

989
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS

990
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
GIRLFRIEND AND SAVED HER, BUT HE

991
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
LOST HIS LIFE.

992
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
A HERO.

993
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED

994
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
SO SOON AFTERWARDS, ANOTHER

995
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
OUTRAGE, MORE FAMILIES

996
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
DECIMATED.

997
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
AND YOU SEE THE GUN RIGHTS GUY

998
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
TONIGHT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO

999
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
ANYTHING.

1000
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
HE THINKS GUNS ARE FUN.

1001
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
YOU CAN'T PROHIBIT PEOPLE'S

1002
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
RIGHTS UNDER THE SECOND
AMENDMENT.

1003
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

1004
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> I SAY TO THEM IT'S NOT ABOUT

1005
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1006
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT OUR SECOND

1007
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1008
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IT'S ABOUT OUR RIGHTS, OUR

1009
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS TO JUST BE

1010
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
ABLE TO GO TO A MOVIE, TO JUST

1011
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
GO TO CHURCH, TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1012
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT IN

1013
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

1014
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
AND I THINK WE AS AMERICANS JUST

1015
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
NEED TO RISE TOGETHER AND SAY

1016
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

1017
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

1018
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
WE -- WE NEED TO REALLY RAISE

1019
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
OUR VOICES AND BAND TOGETHER AND

1020
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
LET OUR LEADERS HEAR US.

1021
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
WE CAN'T JUST TURN OFF THE TV

1022
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AND WALK AWAY.

1023
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
WE HAVE TO BE STRONG TOGETHER

1024
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
LIKE WE ARE TOGETHER.

1025
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
AND THE SANDY HOOK FAMILIES, I'M

1026
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
SURE THEY'RE TOGETHER, HOLDING

1027
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
EACH OTHER.

1028
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST HORRIBLE

1029
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
NIGHTMARE YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE.

1030
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
AND WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE OUR

1031
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
VOICES HEARD.

1032
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

1033
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
WE'LL COME BACK.

1034
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
MUCH MORE.

1035
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
MORE POWERFUL STORIES FROM

1036
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
PEOPLE.

1037
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
THESE INTEREST PEOPLE WHO REALLY

1038
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
SHOULD BE DOING THE TALKING.

1039
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
THEY'VE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH
THIS.

1040
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THEY'VE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES TO
GUNS, TO MASSACRES.

1041
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
AND THEY WANT ACTION.

1042
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'LL TALK TO THEM MORE AFTER THE

1043
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
BREAK.
w?

1044
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000

JESSICA, YOUR DAUGHTER.

1050
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
SHE WAS 24 YEARS OLD.

1051
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SHE WAS AT THAT MOVIE THEATER,

1052
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
HAD GONE TO SEE A MOVIE, AND SHE

1053
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
NEVER CAME HOME.

1054
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
YOU WERE TELLING ME A TOUCHING

1055
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
STORY ABOUT YOUR SON.

1056
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

1057
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>> AFTER HE WENT TO AURORA AND

VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT TELLING US

1062
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
SOLD HIS RIFLE.

1063
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> IT WAS AN AR-15?

1064
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
>> IT WAS AN AR-15.

1065
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WHEN HE GOT HOME, HE JUST

1066
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AND

1067
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WENT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO

1068
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
DO, AND SOLD IT.

1069
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
>> LONNIE, WHEN YOU CAME ON MY

1070
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
SHOW LAST WEEK, AFTER ANOTHER

1071
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SHOOTING IN THE SHOPPING MALL IN

1072
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
OREGON, YOU BOTH ARE SUPPORTERS

1073
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
OF GUNS.

1074
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
AND YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BEING

1075
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
ANTI-GUN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

1076
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
MYTHS OF THIS DEBATE.

1077
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IT'S JUST YOU WANT TO GET RID OF

1078
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
ALL GUNS.

1079
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT DEBATE,

1080
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
IT IS?

1081
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
>> NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

1082
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
IN THIS CASE, THE SHOOTINGS HAD

1083
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
JUST HAPPENED.

1084
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
THIS WOMAN WHOSE SON MURDERED

1085
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HER AND MURDERED THE CHILDREN,

1086
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
IF SHE HAD BOUGHT MAYBE A GUN

1087
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SAFE INSTEAD OF THE AR-15, SHE

1088
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE, AND SO

1089
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WOULD ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

1090
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WE DO NEED TO CHANGE THE LAWS.

1091
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
IF WE COULD START WITH BABY

1092
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
STEPS EVEN.

1093
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEMAND THAT THE

1094
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AR-15 WOULD BE BANNED, BUT IT IS

1095
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
A GREAT IDEA, AND I'M SURE A LOT

1096
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

1097
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
BUT YOU USE COMMON SENSE.

1098
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
GUNOWNERS -- I'M A GUNOWNER.

1099
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A

1100
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
GUNOWNER.
I'M GOING TO PROTECT MY HOUSE.

1101
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN -- THE

1102
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
BURGLARS IN TEXAS THAT.

1103
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
>> WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE GONE BEFORE

1104
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THEY BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE,
BECAUSE IT'S A FINAL JUDGMENT

1105
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
WHEN YOU GET BLOWN AWAY WITH A

1106
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
SHOTGUN.

1107
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BUT THE GUN LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY

1108
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
NEED TO BE ENFORCED WHAT WE

1109
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
HAVE.

1110
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WE NEED TO IMPROVE THEM.

1111
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WE NEED, LIKE DAVE SAID, WE NEED

1112
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
TO HAVE A SENSIBLE REGISTRATION.

1113
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE

1114
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
PEOPLE THAT GET AHOLD OF THESE

1115
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
GUNS.

1116
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THE LAST FOUR KILLINGS HAVE BEEN

1117
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
BY UNSTABLE MENTAL PEOPLE.

1118
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
>> LET ME BRING YOU IN HERE.

1119
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
YOU RUN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1120
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
BUT YOU HAVE A CONNECTION.

1121
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
YOUR OWN BROTHER WAS SHOT AT A

1122
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
SHOOTING OF THE EMPIRE STATE

1123
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
BUILDING IN THE LATE '90s.

1124
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
WE'VE DEBATED THIS A LOT THIS

1125
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WEEK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE.

1126
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
IT'S A VERY EMOTIVE DEBATE.

1127
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
DO YOU FEEL THAT WE HAVE GOT TO

1128
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
A TIPPING POINT HERE, THAT THE

1129
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
MOOD HAS CHANGED?

1130
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
BECAUSE I FEEL IT HAS.

1131
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
>> UNDOUBTEDLY.

1132
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
AND THE BIG REASON IS BECAUSE

1133
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THESE VOICES THAT YOU HEAR, HAVE

1134
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
HERE ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT ARE

1135
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
BEING HEARD.

1136
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THESE INTEREST VOICES THAT NEED

1137
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
TO BE HEARD.

1138
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ONE IN THREE AMERICANS KNOW
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN SHOT.

1139
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
WE'RE NOT AS UNIQUE AS IT MIGHT

1140
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SEEM.

1141
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
32 PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE

1142
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS EVERY SINGLE

1143
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
DAY, AND THE REALITY IS THE ONLY

1144
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
PLACE WHERE THIS IS A PARTISAN

1145
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN THE HALLS
OF CONGRESS.

1146
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
AND WHAT THIS TRAGEDY IS DOING

1147
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
IS IT'S EXPOSING THAT DISCONNECT

1148
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
BETWEEN WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1149
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION WE

1150
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
WANT TO HAVE AND WHAT OUR

1151
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE DOING

1152
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
ABOUT IT.

1153
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
AND TOMORROW WE'RE ALL GOING TO

1154
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO DELIVER 245

1155
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AND THE
PRESIDENT.

1156
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
>> IT SHOULDN'T BE A POLITICAL

1157
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ISSUE.
>> NO.
>> IN AUSTRALIA AND IN BRITAIN

1158
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
WHEN THEY HAD THE SIMILAR

1159
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OUTRAGES, IT WASN'T ABOUT
POLITICS.

1160
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
IT WASN'T LEFT OR RIGHT.
>> NO.

1161
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> IT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE POWER

1162
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
GETTING ACTION.

1163
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
JESSICA, LET ME COME TO YOU.

1164
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUITE

1165
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
EXTRAORDINARY STORY.

1166
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
AND TELL ME QUICKLY THE

1167
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
CONNECTIONS YOU HAVE TO VARIOUS

1168
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1169
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> MY HUSBAND WAS A STUDENT AT

1170
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
COLUMBINE.

1171
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
HE WAS UNINJURED, BUT

1172
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
EMOTIONALLY SCARRED.

1173
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> HE SAW TWO STUDENTS KILLED?

1174
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
>> CORRECT.

1175
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
AND THEN THE LITTLE GIRL I BABY

1176
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
SAT WAS KILLED IN PLATTE CANYON

1177
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
HIGH SCHOOL IN BAILEY, COLORADO

1178
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
IN 2006.

1179
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD?

1180
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD.

1181
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
AND BY A DERANGED GUNMAN WHO

1182
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
RANDOMLY ENTERED THAT SCHOOL.

1183
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
AND THEN MY COUSIN WAS KILLED AT

1184
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THE AURORA THEATER.

1185
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
AND SITTING NEXT TO HIM WAS MY

1186
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL

1187
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
CLASSMATE, AND HE WAS SHOT THREE

1188
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
TIMES, BUT SURVIVED.

1189
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> AND JUST PURE CHANCE.

1190
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1191
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
>> THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1192
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
>> SO YOU HAVE AN ASTONISHING
CONNECTION TO SO MANY OF THESE

1193
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1194
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> YES.

1195
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>> SO THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE,

1196
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
YOU'VE BEEN TAINTED BY WHAT IS
GOING ON.

1197
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> UH-HUH.

1198
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
>> WHY ARE THE AMERICANS SO

1199
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
RELUCTANT TO COLLECTIVELY RISE

1200
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
UP AND DEMAND ACTION, DO YOU

1201
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THINK?

1202
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY

1203
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
TAKES SOMEBODY IN OUR POSITION

1204
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
ONCE WE'VE LOST SOMEBODY, ONCE

1205
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
WE'VE KNOWN SOMEBODY WHO IS

1206
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
INJURED AND ARE -- THEY'VE GOT

1207
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
LASTING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

1208
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
SYNDROME TO REALLY SEE THE

1209
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
EFFECTS AND DAMAGES IT CAUSES,

1210
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNFORTUNATELY A

1211
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
VERY UNIQUE CLUB.

1212
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
>> JERRI, LET ME BRING YOU IN

1213
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
HERE.

1214
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
YOUR SON MATT, HE WAS 27.

1215
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
HE ALSO DIED SHIELDING HIS

1216
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
GIRLFRIEND, ANOTHER HERO IN

1217
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AURORA IN THAT MOVIE THEATER.

1218
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT HIS

1219
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE POLICE.

1220
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
AND HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A

1221
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
FAMILY THAT RESPECTED GUNS.

1222
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
>> YES.

1223
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
HE PROBABLY STARTED LEARNING THE

1224
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
RESPECT OF GUNS, LIKE YOU SAID,

1225
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
MY FATHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER

1226
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
FOR 23 YEARS.

1227
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
AND WHEN MY BOYS WERE LITTLE, HE

1228
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
WOULD TAKE THEM TO HIS SHOOTING

1229
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
RANGE ON HIS PROPERTY.

1230
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
BUT HE ALSO TAUGHT THEM NOT ONLY

1231
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
HOW TO SHOOT A GUN, BUT HOW TO

1232
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
RESPECT IT.

1233
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AND SO WE'RE NOT -- AS FAR AS

1234
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
OUR FAMILY IS CONCERNED, MY

1235
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
HUSBAND AND I WERE NOT AGAINST

1236
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
GUNS.

1237
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY NEEDS

1238
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THESE AR-15s.

1239
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HUNT, YOU'RE

1240
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
NOT GOING TO SHOOT.

1241
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
>> THESE ARE MILITARY WEAPONS.

1242
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
>> RIGHT.
>> TO FIRE OFF 100

1243
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
MAGAZINE-POWERED GUNS IN THE WAY

1244
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THAT HAPPENED IN AURORA, NO

1245
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
AMERICAN CIVILIAN NEEDS THAT

1246
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
OUTSIDE OF THE MILITARY AND THE

1247
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
POLICE FORCE.

1248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THAT IS WHAT ANGERS ME.

1249
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THAT'S WHAT THE DEBATE SHOULD BE
FOCUSED ON.

1250
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
AMANDA WAS YOUR SISTER, MICAYLA,

1251
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
WHO DIED AT 23 IN AURORA.

1252
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
AND ANITA, YOUR COUSIN.

1253
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
NOT ONLY DO YOU FEEL STRONGLY

1254
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
ABOUT THE FUNDRAISING THAT WENT
ON AFTER THIS.

1255
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POURS IN.

1256
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
YOU'RE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENS

1257
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
WITH IT AND PEOPLE TRYING TO

1258
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
HELP WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

1259
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
FAMILIES AT SANDY HOOK.

1260
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
>> WE LEARNED A LOT IN AURORA

1261
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
WITH PEOPLE.

1262
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
AFTER ONE OF THESE NATIONAL

1263
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
TRAGEDIES HAPPENS, THERE IS ALL

1264
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
THESE FUNDS STARTING UP THAT

1265
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.

1266
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY

1267
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
GENEROUS AND VERY GRACIOUS.

1268
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
AND THEY DO WANT TO HELP.

1269
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
AND THEY GIVE MONEY, AND THEY

1270
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
GIVE MONEY TO NONPROFITS.

1271
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
AND WHAT WE FOUND IN AURORA IS

1272
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THAT THEY WERE GIVING MONEY TO A

1273
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
NONPROFIT THAT THEN GIVES TO IT

1274
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OTHER NONPROFITS.

1275
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WE'VE STARTED AS A GROUP

1276
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
EVERYONE HERE A ORGANIZATION

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
CALLED VICTIMS FIRST.

1278
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
VICTIMSFIRST.ORG.

1279
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE

1280
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THAT THE SANDY HOOK VICTIMS DO

1281
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
NOT GET VICTIMIZED LIKE WE DID

1282
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THIS.

1283
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
HAPPENED TO THE VICTIMS OF 9/11

1284
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
WHERE A HANDFUL OF FAMILIES HAD

1285
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
TO STAND UP AND STOP THE MONEY

1286
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
FROM GOING ELSEWHERE.

1287
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY WITH

1288
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
HURRICANE SANDY.

1289
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
YOU HAD THE STATEN ISLAND

1290
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
BOROUGH PRESIDENT COME OUT AND

1291
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
SAY STOP GIVING MONEY.

1292
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF IT.

1293
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AND IT'S JUST GOT TO STOP.

1294
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.

1295
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
AND I WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS
WITH THAT, AMANDA.

1296
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I CAN SEE YOU'RE VERY DISTRAUGHT
ABOUT THIS.

1297
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
IF THERE IS ONE THING YOU COULD

1298
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
SAY TO PEOPLE ABOUT GUNS, WHAT

1299
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
WOULD YOU SAY?

1300
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>> GOD, PIERS, PUT ME ON THE

1301
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
SPOT HERE.

1302
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'M ABSOLUTELY AGAINST GUNS IN

1303
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
ANY FASHION.

1304
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
HUNT ME SOME DEER, BUT GOD, WE

1305
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
DON'T NEED THEM ON THE STREETS

1306
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
IN ANY FASHION.

1307
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
>> I THINK THE WORDS EVERYONE

1308
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
SHOULD TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY,

1309
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM FAMILIES
SUCH AS YOURS.

1310
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

1311
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
JOINING ME.

1312
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

1313
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL USE

1314
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO

1315
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
ENSURE THERE ARE NO MORE
TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE IN

1316
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
CONNECTICUT.

1317
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN THE GUN

1318
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
POLICIES WILL CHANGE.

1319
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE
COME BACK.

1320
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
lower cholesterol

1321
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
as part
of a heart healthy diet.

1322
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That's true.

1323
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
...But you still have to go
to the gym.

1324
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
♪ The one and only, Cheerios

1325
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID LAST

1326
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
NIGHT IN NEWTOWN HE WAS GOING TO

1327
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
DO SOMETHING.

1328
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL HE DO?

1329
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
JOINING ME IS CHARLES BLOW FROM

1330
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

1331
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED PRETTY

1332
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
FIRED UP AND HE SEEMED PRETTY

1333
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
DETERMINED.

1334
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
IS HE GOING TO DO ANYTHING?

1335
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
AND IF HE DOES, WHAT IS HE GOING

1336
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
TO DO?

1337
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.

1338
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
WE'VE HAD AT LEAST FOR THE LAST

1339
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
FIVE YEARS IF NOT FOR THE LAST

1340
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
TEN IS A DAMPENING DOWN OF KIND

1341
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
OF DISCUSSION OF PEOPLE WHO WANT

1342
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
TO SEE SOME SORT OF SENSIBLE GUN

1343
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
CONTROL RESTRICTIONS.

1344
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
AND IN THAT VOID, THE NRA AND

1345
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
GUN, PRO-GUN ADVOCATES HAVE

1346
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
ACTUALLY GROWN STRONGER.

1347
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
YOU WOW WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MAYBE

1348
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THEY SAW THERE WASN'T AS MUCH

1349
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
OPPOSITION AND DIDN'T HAVE TO
SPEND MUCH MONEY.

1350
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
IN FACT, THEIR SPENDING HAS

1351
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
INCREASED.

1352
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
SO NOW YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN

1353
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
CONTROL LOBBY IS PROBABLY ONE

1354
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
PEOPLE KNOW MOST IS THE BRADY

1355
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
CAMPAIGN.

1356
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THE NRA SPENDS ABOUT 66 TIMES AS

1357
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
MUCH ON LOBBYING AS THE BRADY

1358
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
CAMPAIGN.

1359
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
AND THEY SPENT DURING THE

1360
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTING TO

1361
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
CANDIDATES 4100 TIMES AS MUCH AS

1362
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1363
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
THIS HAS NOW BECOME A ONE-SIDED

1364
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
DISCUSSION, AND AMERICA DESERVES
A DISCUSSION.

1365
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
>> THIS HAS BEEN A TIPPING

1366
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
POINT.

1367
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I THINK IT WAS SO GROTESQUE,

1368
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
COMING ON THE BACK OF AURORA,

1369
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
WHICH IN ITSELF WAS HORRIFYING

1370
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
BEYOND BELIEF, A MOVIE THEATER,

1371
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
NOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

1372
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
BARACK OBAMA AFTER BEING

1373
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
REELECTED, HE HAS TO THINK OF A

1374
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
LEGACY NOW.
DOES HE WANT HIS LEGACY TO BE A

1375
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
SERIES OF FURTHER MASS SHOOTINGS

1376
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
IN WHICH HE DID NOTHING.

1377
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE

1378
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
MORE MASS SHOOTINGS.

1379
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR ALREADY IN

1380
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF

1381
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
INCREASING APPALLING DETAIL.

1382
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE WORSE.

1383
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
>> I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT IN

1384
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THE SENSE THAT EVERY CAUSE HAS

1385
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
AN INFLECTION POINT.

1386
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
AND THIS MAY BE THE INFLECTION

1387
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
POINT FOR THE CAUSE OF PEOPLE

1388
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WHO WANT TO AT LEAST SEE A

1389
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
REINSTATEMENT OF THE ASSAULT

1390
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1391
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO

1392
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
DO AS A SOCIETY, AND WHAT I HOPE

1393
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE PREPARED

1394
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
TO DO IS TO SAY WE HAVE TO START

1395
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ON -- START STOPPING THE

1396
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
PROLIFERATION OF GUNS IN A

1397
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
SOCIETY.

1398
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
WHAT WE'RE FAST APPROACHING AT

1399
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
THE MOMENT IS WHERE WE WILL HAVE

1400
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
MORE GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN

1401
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
WE HAVE HUMAN BEINGS.

1402
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE ABOUT 300

1403
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
MILLION GUNS IN CIRCULATION.

1404
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
THE POPULATION IS --

1405
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
>> 311, RIGHT.

1406
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
>> HOW MANY CHILDREN.

1407
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
>> RIGHT.

1408
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
>> YOU ALREADY HAVE MORE GUNS

1409
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
THAN THERE ARE ADULTS IN

1410
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
AMERICA.

1411
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
>> ACCORDING TO GALLUP, 45% OF

1412
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY HAVE

1413
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
A GUN IN THEIR HOME THAT MEANS

1414
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN

1415
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
ONE GUN IN THEIR HOMES.

1416
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE SAY THEY

1417
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
HAVE ACTUALLY FIRED A GUN THIS

1418
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THEIR LIFETIMES.

1419
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
THAT MEANS WE AS A CULTURE ARE

1420
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
GETTING TO A SATURATION POINT

1421
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
FROM WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

1422
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
PULL BACK.

1423
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AFTER

1424
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
THESE SHOOTINGS, UNLIKE WHAT WE

1425
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WHERE PEOPLE

1426
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
SAY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

1427
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
ABOUT THIS, WE NEED TO STOP

1428
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
BUYING GUNS.

1429
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
WHAT WE ARE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T

1430
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
HAVE THE ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER

1431
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
SIDE, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SAY

1432
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, I

1433
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO NOT BEAR

1434
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
ARMS, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO

1435
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
FEEL SAFE.

1436
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
WHO IS MY ADVOCATE WHO SAYS THAT

1437
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
FOR THIS PERSON WHO DECIDES THAT

1438
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I DON'T WANT TO OWN A GUN, HOW

1439
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
DO WE MAKE THAT PERSON FEEL SAFE

1440
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
OR DOES THAT PERSON GET TO A

1441
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
POINT WHERE THEY SAY BECAUSE 50,

1442
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
60, WHATEVER IT GETS TO BE,

1443
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS A

1444
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
GUN, I ACTUALLY NEED TO GET ONE

1445
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

1446
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
>> THE POINT IS THERE IS ALREADY

1447
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROL IN THE

1448
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
COUNTRY.

1449
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THE GUN LOBBY MAKES OUT THIS

1450
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
HIDEOUS NEW THING DESIGNED TO

1451
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
SHACKLE THEM BUT THIS PARTICULAR

1452
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
TYPE OF RIFLE IS NOW THE

1453
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
PREFERRED MASS SHOOTER'S

1454
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
INSTRUMENT OF DEVASTATING MURDER

1455
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
AND THAT IS WHY IT HAS TO BE

1456
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
TARGETED.

1457
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THE LAST THREE SHOOTINGS, THE

1458
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
AR-15 WAS USED BECAUSE IT LOOKS

1459
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
AS THE GUNN RIGHTS TOLD ME LIKE

1460
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS.

1461
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THIS HE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF

1462
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
CIRCULATION.

1463
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
>> YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1464
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
COMMITTING THESE MASS SHOOTINGS

1465
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
WITH REGULAR HUNTING RIFLES OR

1466
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
MASS SHOOTINGS WITH REGULAR

1467
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
REINVOLVERS.

1468
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
THESE ARE SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS,

1469
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
AND THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION.

1470
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
A GUEST WAS SAYING THIS IS NOT

1471
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

1472
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

1473
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
DOES.

1474
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE TRIGGER

1475
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
GO -- THAT THE HAMMER GO ALL THE

1476
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
WAY BACK AND YOU SQUEEZE AGAIN
REALLY HARD.

1477
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THE TRIGGERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

1478
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
YOU JUST PULSE THE FINGER.

1479
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
YOU CAN GET OFF THREE TO FIVE

1480
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
ROUNDS IN ONE SECOND.

1481
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1482
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THE POWER OF A AUTOMATIC AND THE

1483
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
AR-15s IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

1484
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
EQUIPMENT.
THAT'S THE REALITY.

1485
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1486
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
HT FROM US .

1487
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
SO, I'M HAPPY.

1488
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
SALES GO UP... I'M HAPPY.

1489
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
IT WENT OUT TODAY... I'M HAPPY.

1490
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WHAT IF SHE'S NOT HOME?

1491
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
(TOGETHER)
SHE WON'T BE HAPPY.

1492
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
USE UPS! SHE CAN GET
A TEXT ALERT, REROUTE...

1493
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
EVEN RESCHEDULE HER PACKAGE.

1494
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
IT'S UPS MY CHOICE.

1495
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ARE YOU HAPPY?
I'M HAPPY.

1496
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'M HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY.

1498
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'M HAPPY.

00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
HAPPY.

HAPPY.

1500
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
(TOGETHER)
HAPPY.

1501
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I LOVE LOGISTICS.

1502
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
SFX- "sounds of african
drum and flute"

1503
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Look who's back.

1504
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Again?

1505
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's embarrassing

1506
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It's embarrassing!
We can see you Carl.

1507
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
We can totally see you.

1508
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Come on you're better than
this...all that prowling around.

1509
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah, you're the
king of the jungle.

1510
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Have you thought about going
vegan Carl?

1511
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
HAHAHA!!

1512
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You know folks who save hundreds
of dollars by

1513
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

1514
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

1515
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Happier than antelope with
night-vision goggles.

1516
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Nice!

1517
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

1518
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

1519
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
>>> SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

1520
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
THAT COULD LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1521
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND

1522
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TO SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1523
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH SHE

1524
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE SHE

1525
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
SHOWED US IS REMARKABLE.

1526
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1527
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I AM SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

1528
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
>> SPEAKING OVER THE WEEKEND AND

1529
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY GUESTS

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
FOR HE CAN HERE AND WE LEAVE YOU

1531
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
POWERFUL WORDS FROM MR. PARKER.

1532
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
HIS DAUGHTER WAS KILLED AT THE

1533
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY AND HE

1534
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
GAVE US A STATEMENT.

1535
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
THANKING THOSE HE REACHED OUT TO

1536
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
HELP THE FAMILIES AND HE WENT ON

1537
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
TO SAY THIS, REMEMBER THE

1538
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND KEEP THEM

1539
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS AND DO NOT

1540
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
LET THEIR BRIGHT SHANING FIESS

1541
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
BECOME EXTINGUISHED.

1542
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
LET US DO EVERYTHING IN OUR

1543
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
POWER TO ENSURE THEIR LIGHT

1544
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
CONTINUES TO SHINE BRIGHTER AND

1545
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
BRIGHTER IN ALL THAT WE DO TO

1546
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
REMEMBER THEM.

1547
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
THAT'S ALL FOR US TONIGHT.
