00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

740
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

741
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

742
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
>> ADDS WE REMEMBER THE 20 KIDS

743
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THE 6 ADULTS BLAMED IN THE

744
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT IT IS HARD

745
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO REMEMBER THE FACT THAT 17

746
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
DAYS AWAY FROM WHAT WE WERE

747
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
TALKING ABOUT LAST WEEK FALLING

748
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
OFF THE FISCAL CLIFF.

749
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
IT IS HARDLY BEING MENTIONED

750
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
RIGHT NOW.

751
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
LATE THIS AFTERNOON WORD LEAKED

752
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
IN WASHINGTON THAT THE

753
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

754
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
JOHN BOEHNER AGREED TO HAVE

755
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
TAXES TO GO UP FOR TOP EARNERS

756
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
FROM THE 35-36 PERCENT.

757
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I THINK IT'S 36 PERCENT.

758
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ONLY THOSE MAKING OVER 1 MILLION

759
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
A YEAR NOT THE 250,000 A YEAR

760
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000

SHOOTING.

767
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
YOU REMEMBER THAT ONE ABOUT 15

768
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
YEARS AGO WHEN MIKE HUCKABEE WAS

769
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THE GOVERNOR.

770
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000

EARLIER.
YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THE

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ABOUT THE

773
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
POLITICAL NATURE OF IT?

774
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS FULL OF

775
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T KNOW QUITE

776
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
WHAT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

777
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
>> I REALLY HAVE TO DISAGREE

778
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WITH PEOPLE WHO CALL IT

779
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
POLITICAL THAT YOU DON'T THINK

780
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU CAN TOLERATE IT ANY MORE.

781
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THEY ARE SAYING NOWHERE THEY

782
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ALLOW THINGS TO GO ON.

783
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY.

784
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
>> YOU GO HOPEFULLY SAYING A

785
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
COMMISSION ON GUN VIOLENCE AND

786
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT THINGS
THAT ARE FEEDING INTO IT WHETHER

787
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
IT IS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

788
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
WHETHER IT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF

789
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

790
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
THEY HAVE MASS KILLINGS AND

791
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS

792
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
NOT JUST GUN CONTROL.

793
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
>> I CAN DO WITHOUT ASSAULT

794
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WEAPONS BEING AVAILABLE TO EVERY

795
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000

JONESBOROS HAPPENS THEY GO AWAY

797
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
AND THEY KEPT ONGOING BACK.

798
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> THERE IS A LOT OF

799
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
SIMILARITIES CHILDREN, WE SAW

800
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
PARENTS STRUGGLING TO FIND

801
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
ANSWERS FOR THIS.

802
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THEY HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES WITH

803
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THIS.
OR SHELL SHOCKED AFTER THAT.

804
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE

805
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
PERSON IN THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

806
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SPEECH WAS HIGHLY POLITICAL.

807
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SPEAKING FROM THE HEART AS A

808
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
FATHER EXPRESSING HIS SYMPATHIES

809
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I DO LIKE WHAT HE SAID TO WHAT

810
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DEGREE WE CAN SHARE IN YOUR PAIN

811
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
TO EASE YOUR BURDEN.

812
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THAT WAS IMPORTANT.
IT SHIFTED IN WHAT DO WE NEED TO

813
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
DO HERE.

814
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

815
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T ZERO ONLY

816
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
IN ON GUN CONTROL.

817
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE.

818
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THAT PERSON SAID THERE'S ALSO

819
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT IS

820
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
VERY IMPORTANT IT CANNOT

821
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
DISREGARD THE INFLUENCE OF THE

822
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN

823
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
SITUATIONS INVOLVING MASS

824
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
SHOOTINGS AND TELEVISION AND

825
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
VIDEO GAMES THEY HAVE A BIG

826
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
IMPACT ON IT.

827
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
A OO THE BOEHNER PROPOSAL IT

828
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
GOES UP ONLY IF YOU MAKE A

829
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
MILLION OR MORE.
>> I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

830
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
GREAT DEAL IF THAT'S WHAT HE IS

831
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
WILLING TO DO.

832
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THEY ARE ON THE LEFT WHICH IS

833
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IMPORTANT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY

834
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
WHAT DOES HE CARE?

835
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THEY HAVE TO GET IT THROUGH

836
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
CONGRESS.

837
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THE ANSWER WOULD BE HE'S GOING

838
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
TO HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

839
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THAT.
THEY WANT TO SEE BECAUSE THE

840
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
PRESIDENT HAS CAVE THE ON THE

841
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
ISSUE IN THE PAST IN THE LEFT

842
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
THEY WANT TO SEE THE TAX RATE

843
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
GOING UP ON EVERYBODY OVER 250.

844
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT IS

845
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
A GREAT DEAL IF YOU CAN GET 39

846
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
PERCENT ON ANYBODY OVER A

847
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
MILLION.

848
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>> ME, TOO.

849
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL LET

850
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
YOU RESPOND ON THAT.

851
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
PLUS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE

852
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
ARE SOME ACTUALLY SAYING THAT

853
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS FAKING HER

854
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
INJURY TO AVOID TESTIFYING ABOUT

855
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
BENGHAZI GATE.

856
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
YOU WILL HEAR FROM A FORMER U.N.

857
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
AMBASSADOR AFTER THIS.

858
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
>> THEY TESTIFIED SHE HAS EVERY

859
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
EXPECTATION THAT SHE WILL BE

860
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
TESTIFYING.

861
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU KNOW SHE

862
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
HAS ALREADY STATED SHE WILL BE

863
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
STEPPING DOWN.

864
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD REPORTS

865
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THAT SENATOR KERRY WHO IS

866
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
HEADING THE SENATE FOREIGN

867
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
RELATIONS COMMITTEE WILL BE

868
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
TAKING HER SPOT.

869
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I FEAR BECAUSE OF THE SHUFFLE

870
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THAT IS GOING ON WE MAY NOT BE

871
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
ABLE TO HEAR FROM SECRETARY

872
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
CLINTON ON THE BENGHAZI

873
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
TERRORIST ATTACK.

874
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
WE WILL BE A POOR NATION FOR IT.

875
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
>> THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT

876
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
REPUBLICANS CRYING FOUL AS

877
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON

878
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
SUFFERING FROM THE AFTERMATH OF

879
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A CONCUSSION SHE WILL NOT BE

880
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
TESTIFYING ABOUT AGABENGHAZI AF

881
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
ALL.

882
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
SHE WILL BE LEAVING AFTER THE

883
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
APPOINTMENT OF SENATOR JOHN

884
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
KERRY TO REPLACE HER.

885
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THE FEAR OF REPUBLICANS IS THEY

886
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
WILL NEVER GET TO HEAR SECRETARY

887
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
CLINTON'S VERSION OF THE TRAGIC

888
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
EVENTS IN LIBYA FORMER

889
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS

890
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
RICHARD WILLIAMSON DO YOU, IS

891
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
THAT ACCURATE AMBASSADOR?

892
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
>> I THINK THAT'S AN OVER

893
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
STATEMENT.
WE ALL HAVE TO HAVE SYMPATHY.

894
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I THINK THE CONCERN IS TWO

895
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
FACTORS HAVE TO BE ANSWERED.

896
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THE FIRST TIME IN 32 YEARS AN

897
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR WAS KILLED

898
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
IN A TERRORIST ATTACK AS WELL AS

899
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
THE OTHER AMERICANS.

900
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE

901
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
STATE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO

902
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
PROVIDE ADEQUATE SECURITY AND

903
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
THEN SECURITIONDLY IT WAS EVIDE

904
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
THE TERRORIST STRATEGY OF

905
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
TARGETING KILLINGS OF AL QAEDA

906
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
HAS FAILED THAT AL QAEDA IS VERY

907
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ACTIVE IN NORTHERN AFRICA.

908
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THOSE ARE THE TWO ISSUES.

909
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
>> DO YOU THINK SHE IS LYING

910
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
ABOUT BEING SICK AND HAVING A

911
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
CONCLUSION?
>> NO, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

912
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD BE

913
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
INAPPROPRIATE FOR HER TO LEAVE

914
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
OFFICE ABOUT AHEARING BEFORE

915
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
CONGRESS.
THERE IS TIME FOR THAT AND I

916
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
HOPE SHE DOES.

917
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
>> YOU STILL THINK THAT SHE

918
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SHOULD AND YOU BELIEVE HER

919
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
EXPLANATION OF HER MALTY AND HER

920
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
REASONS FOR NOT TESTIFYING NOW.

921
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
>> I HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION

922
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
HER WORD.

923
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
WHAT I DO QUESTION IS THE DELAYS

924
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
OF THE STONE WALLING ON BENGHAZI

925
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
SO LONG.

926
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
NOW WE HAVE TO GET THE STORY.

927
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
WE WILL HAVE HEARINGS THIS WEEK.

928
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
THERE WILL BE MORE HEARINGS

929
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
HOPEFULLY SECRETARY CLINTON WILL

930
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
MAKE SURE SHE TESTIFYS TO

931
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

932
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
OF THE DETAILS OF FAILURE OF

933
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY AND

934
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THE ADEQUACY OF POLICY ON

935
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
TEARRISM.
>> IN LITTLE ROCK TONIGHT WHAT

936
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
DO YOU THINK?
>> I HOPE SECRETARY CLINTON HAS

937
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A GOOD NOTE FROM HER DOCTOR.

938
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
BAD ENOUGH FOR THE OWE BAM PAW

939
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
CAMPAIGN TO PUT AMBASSADOR RICE

940
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ON THERE SPEAKING ON MORNING

941
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
SHOWS GIVING THEM DENY ABILITY

942
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
AS SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

943
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
BENGHAZI BUT NOW WE HAVE THE

944
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THEM ASKING JOHN KERRY TO ANSWER

945
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
QUESTIONS CLINTON SHOULD BE

946
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
DOING.
THEY MISLED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

947
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
AND MISLED THE PRESS.

948
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE FOUR DEAD

949
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES

950
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
DESERVE TO KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD

951
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT COULD

952
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN.

953
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> YOU THINK IN THE NFL WHEN

954
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
THEY DOO A TIME-OUT AND THE

955
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OTHER PEOPLE LINES UP IN A

956
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
FORMATION THAT IS STRANGE AND

957
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THEY ARE AFRAID THAT THEY ARE

958
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
NOT PREPARED FOR IT.

959
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SOME GUY PULLS DOWN MAKES BELIEF

960
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
HE HURT HIS ANKLE OR SOMETHING

961
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
THEY HAVE TO PAUSE FOR THE

962
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
STRETCHERS TO COME OUT OR THE

963
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TRAINERS TO LOOK AT IT?

964
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT THAT

965
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IS?
>> I HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT

966
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
IS THE CASE.

967
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE IDEA

968
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
THAT BECAUSE SHE HAS A

969
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
CONCUSSION SHE IS NOT WORKING TO

970
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
CANCEL THE TRIP SHE IS NOT

971
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
WILLING TO TESTIFY ADDS UP.

972
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I AM SURE CONGRESS IS HAPPY TO

973
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
REARRANGE HAVE HER COME AND

974
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
TESTIFY WHENEVER WOULD WORK FOR

975
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
HER.
NOT GOING TO BE OUT OF WORK FOR

976
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

977
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

978
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
FURTHERMORE EVEN IF IT WAS AFTER

979
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
SHE LEFT THEY DON'T BAR HER FROM

980
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
KNOWING HOW IT HAPPENED AND WHY

981
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
THIS TRAGEDY OCCURRED AND WHAT

982
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
THE DEPARTMENT PLAYS IN NOT

983
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
PROVIDING TO SECURITY AND SO

984
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
FORTH.

985
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
>> SO WE SUSPEND OUR USUAL

986
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
DISBELIEF WHEN A COINCIDENCE IS

987
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
CONVENIE

988
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
CONVENIENT?

989
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
>> I AM NOT GOING TO ACCUSE HER

990
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
OF LYING.

991
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
>> ME EITHER.

992
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> SHE SAID SHE FAINTED AND HAS

993
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
A CONCLUSION.

994
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
>> NO.
I BELIEVE THAT PART.

995
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
>> I JUST DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

996
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BE ALLOWED TO NOT TESTIFY.

997
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THIS IS ABSURD THIS IDEA -- BUY

998
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THE IDEA SHE CAN'T EVER TESTIFY

999
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
ON THIS BECAUSE SHE IS ILL

1000
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1001
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
>> SO IS IT POSSIBLE, THOUGH,

1002
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
YOU HAVE THE INAUGURATION YOU

1003
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
HAVE THE HOLIDAYS THAT SHE WILL

1004
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
NEVER TESTIFY?

1005
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
>> I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE BUT

1006
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT.

1007
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
>> THEY CAN ARRANGE IT AROUND

1008
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
HER SCHEDULE.

1009
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
>> AMBASSADOR?

1010
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
>> GERALDO, CONGRESS WILL COME

1011
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
BACK IN SESSION IN JANUARY PRIOR

1012
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
TO THE INAUGURAL.

1013
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
PRESUMING THAT THE PRESIDENT

1014
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
NOMINATES SENATOR KERRY THEY

1015
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
WILL BE HEARING THE VOTE ON THAT

1016
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THAT MAY BE DONE BY

1017
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
JANUARY 20TH.

1018
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF WEEKS

1019
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
WHERE CONGRESS IS IN SESSION

1020
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HOPEFULLY THE SECRETARY WILL

1021
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
UNDERSTAND IT AS PART OF HER

1022
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
RESPONSIBILITY THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO COME UP AND EXPLAIN

1023
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
WHY THEY FAILED IN SECURITY WHY

1024
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
OUR STRATEGY ON TERRORISM IS

1025
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
FAILING.
>> AMBASSADOR RICHARD

1026
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
WILLIAMSON.
FINALLY AS WE END TONIGHT'S SHOW

1027
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WANT YOU

1028

1029

"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE".

1030

LAST NIGHT THEY WERE SINCERE AND

1033
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THEY PLAYED A VERY STRAIGHT

1034
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
TRIBUTE TO ALL OF THE VICTIMS OF

1035
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THE NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT

1036
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
MASSACRE.
