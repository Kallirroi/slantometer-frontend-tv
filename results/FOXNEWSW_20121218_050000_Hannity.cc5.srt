SHOOTING, IT WAS NOT A BIG

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

UP ROOTS AND LEAVE NEW TOWN TO

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000

20 CHILDREN AGES 6 AND 7, AND

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SIX ADULTINGS WERE GUNNED DOWN

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AND THEY WERE BY ALL ACCOUNTS

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO WERE

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
HERORIC IN DEATH AS THEY GAVE

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THEIR LIVES WHO SERVED THE

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THEIR

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CARE.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT CAN

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
RELIEVE THE ORCH WHELMING PAIN

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
AND SORROW THAT THE FAMILY AND

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
VICTIMS ARE FEELING NOW AND

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THAT WILL STAY WITH THEM FOR

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS TO

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
BEYOND MESSAGE.
THIS IS WHAT EVIL DOES.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
AND WE ARE PRAYING FOR THE

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SAID THAT WITHOUT SPECTACULARS

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000

WE'LL SEE AN AVALANCHE OF

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
COMMENTS.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WE ARE FACING A LIBERAL

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
IDEOLOGY THAT WANTS TO UNDO

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THEY

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
ARE EAGER TO ADVANCE THEIR

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CAUSE.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WHAT IS IT FOR US.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THREE DAYS AFTER THE NEWTOWN

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
TRAGEDY.
THINK ABOUT WE ACT AND RESIST

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THE TEMPTATION.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AND JAMMING THROUGH

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO DO

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SOMETHING IF WE DO, DO

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SOMETHING LET'S BE SMART ABOUT

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
IT AND PURSUE POLICILESS THAT

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WORK ASK NOT MAKE THE PEOPLE

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
ON THE LEFT FEEL BETTER.

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
AND WE MIGHT SAVE INNOCENT

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
LIVES.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IF THE LEFT RESPECTS THE

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CONSTITUTIONAL ROITS PERHAPS

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THEY'LL LOOK AT SEARCHING OUR

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
POLICY RELATED TO MENTAL

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
HEALTH AND SCHOOL SECURITY.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL BE

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
EXPOSED FOR CONCLUDING WHAT IS

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HAPPENING.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THEY ARE ADVANCING FOR AGENDA.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000

THEY LOOK LIKE SICK

264
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000

THE QUESTION IS TO GET TO THEM

THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000

So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

340

GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There's something
that works differently

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000

the flu virus at its source.

351

685
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
AND IF WE TAX THE TOP TWO

THE PRIZE.

769
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THE WINNER OF THE MOST BIAG.

770
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I IS THE DOWN WITH JOLE

771
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
OLSTEIN AND

772
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
COPD makes it hard
to breathe,

773
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

774
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

775
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

776
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
significantly improve

777
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
lung function.

778
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

779
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

780
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

781
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

782
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

783
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
for sudden symptoms

784
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

785
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

786
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

787
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

788
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and some eye problems.

789
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

790
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

791
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

792
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

793
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
improve your lung function.

NOTHING YOU COULD SAY TO ME

THESE THINGS .

988
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
OF TIME.

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
AND WORDS CAN'T COMPLESS.

991
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
BUT JUST BEING THERE.

992
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
YOU DON'T NEED TO STAY MANAGE

993
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
AND HAVING PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU

994
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AND KNOWING SUPPOSE.

995
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
>> I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE

996
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
FORGIVING AS A CHRISTIAN.

997
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS PAIN.

998
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
YOU LOSE YOUR CHILD AND

999
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
SOMEONE KILLS YOUR KID.

1000
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I KNOW WHAT JESUS DID ON THE

1001
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
CROSS, BUT I AM NOT JESUS AS

1002
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
AWE LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW.

1003
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I AM SHOWERS, I DON'T KNOW HOW

1004
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
YOU DO THAT.

1005
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
>> SEAN, YOU NEVER WERE IN

1006
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
THUATION AND YOU DON'T HAVE

1007
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
THE GRACE AND FATHOM THAT.

1008
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARED ARE

1009
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000

1010
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
ASK ONE SAID WE HAVEN'T WE ARE

1011
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
JUST TOO SAD.

1012
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IF I WOULD ANGRY, TOO.

1013
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I WOULD LOSE MY MIND.

1014
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
THERE ARE PHASES OF THE ANGER

1015
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
AND GRIEF AND YOU DEALT WITH

1016
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
PARENTS THAT LOST THEIR KIDS.

1017
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
>> IT IS UNNATURAL.

1018
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
YOU DON'T EXPECT TO LOSE YOUR

1019
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
CHILD .

1020
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
YOU GO THROUGH THE PAIN.

1021
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
AND THE THING YOU DO IS GET

1022
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
STUCK IN ONE AREA.

1023
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL FIPED THE

1024
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
SUPPORT.

1025
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

1026
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
IF THAT CHILD COULD COME BACK.

1027
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THEY WOULD NOT WANT THAT CHILD

1028
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
STUCK.
MY ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE

1029
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
PARENTS IS IT IS HARD AND

1030
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
COULD TAKE YEARS AND YEARS AND

1031
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
IF YOU WANT TO GET CLOSE TO

1032
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
YOUR CHILD.

1033
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
GET CLOSE TO GOD.

1034
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
YOUR CHILD IS WITH GROD GOD.

1035
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
>> YOU MARRIED UP.

1036
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
AND THAT IS -- I GAVE YOU A

1037
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000

BEING A PAIN IN THE NECK.

1042
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> WHAT IS THE HARDEST THING

1043
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
TO COUNSEL.
THIS AND THE INDICATING OF A

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS.

1046
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS TO SAY.

1047
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
MOURN WITH THOSE THAT MORN.

1048
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
AND WEEP WITH THOSE THAT WIPE.

1049
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000

YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT A DAY AT A

1051
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
TIME.
