00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
AS HER RELATIVES GRIEVE, THEY

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
ARE ALSO TRYING TO HELP HER

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
BROTHER TRAVIS UNDERSTAND WHY HE

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
CAN'T PLAY WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE IS HIS

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
BEST FRIEND.
WE FOUND OUT JESSICA LOVED

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
HORSES.
SHE LOVED WATCHING HORSE MOVIES,

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
DRAWING HORSES.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
APPARENTLY SHE ASKED SANTA CLAUS

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THIS CHRISTMAS FOR A NEW PAIR OF

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
COW GIRL BOOTS.

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THE FUNERAL HELD AT ST. ROSE OF

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
LIMA CHURCH THERE IN NEWTOWN.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THE FAMILY POSTED A PUBLIC

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
OBITUARY.
THEY CALLED HIM, QUOTE, OUR

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
BELOVED PRINCE.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THEY SAY JAMES LOVED SCHOOL AND

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
SPENT HOURS AND HOURS PLAYING

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
HOCKEY.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
STUDENTS IN NEWTOWN, THEY ARE

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
BACK IN SCHOOL TODAY.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
BUT TO BE CLEAR, NOT THE

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
STUDENTS OF SANDY HOOK

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
STUDENTS AT OTHER SCHOOLS, THEY

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
ARE SEEING MORE POLICE, MORE

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
COUNSELORS ON HAND, JUST BEING

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
IN TOWN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
OFFICERS JUST SITTING IN THE

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
DRIVEWAYS OF A LOT OF THE

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
SCHOOLS HERE, CLEARLY SECURITY

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
BEING BEEFED UP IN THIS TOWN

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
RIGHT NOW.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TEACHERS UNION SAYS CLASSES WILL

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
DISCUSS THE SHOOTING IN AGE

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
APPROPRIATE MANNER.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR YET, THOUGH,

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WHEN SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
SCHOOL WILL RESUME CLASS.

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
BUT WHEN THEY DO, IT WILL

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
CERTAINLY BE AT A DIFFERENT

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
SCHOOL IN THE NEIGHBORING TOWN

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OF MONROE.

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
AND I JUST GOT BACK FROM NEWTOWN

83
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THIS MORNING, AND DURING DINNER

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
TIME LAST NIGHT, I WAS INVITED

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THESE

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
TWO VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS,

87
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THEY'RE WITH NEWTOWN HOOK AND

88
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
LADDER AND THEY WENT INTO

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
EMERGENCY MODE, OF COURSE, EARLY

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
LAST FRIDAY MORNING.

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THEY ARE ROB MANA AND RAY CORBO.

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THEY SERVED THEIR COMMUNITY NOW

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS EACH.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
BUT THE DAY THEY GOT THAT CALL,

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THEY SAY IT WAS LIKE NOTHING

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HOW LONG HAVE YOU ALL BEEN

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
VOLUNTEERING AS FIREFIGHTERS?

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
>> ABOUT 21 YEARS.

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> A LITTLE OVER 25.

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> AND WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY?

102
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
>> I WAS WORKING PROBABLY ABOUT

103
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
2,000 FEET FROM THE SCHOOL, ON A

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
STONE WALL IN BUSINESS DISTRICT

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
IN THE CENTER OF SANDY HOOK.

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SO MY RESPONSE TIME WAS VERY

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
QUICK.
I WAS THERE VERY SOON.

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> SO YOU WERE THERE.

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
>> MM-HMM.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
>> DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YOU WERE WALKING INTO?

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
>> NO.
>> NOT AT ALL.

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
MATTER OF FACT, WE WERE JUST

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WE HAD A FIRE CALL A FEW MINUTES

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AGO AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THAT ON THE WAY BACK.

118
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AND YOU GET THE INITIAL DISPATCH

119
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AND YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
YOU'RE COMING INTO, BUT FOR THE

121
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MOST PART YOU'RE READY FOR IT.

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AND THIS TIME THAT'S NOT THE

123
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
CASE.

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> YOU'RE NEVER READY FOR THIS.

125
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
>> NEVER.

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY -- ANYBODY

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ANYWHERE, IF THEY TELL YOU THEY

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
WERE READY FOR SOMETHING LIKE

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THIS, THEY'RE NOT BEING HONEST
WITH YOU.

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SPECIFICS, BUT HELP US

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
UNDERSTAND, IN THE SCHOOL, WERE

133
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
PEOPLE PANICKED, WERE THEY

134
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SCREAMING, WERE THEY RUNNING?

135
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

136
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> IT WAS VERY CHAOTIC AND VERY

137
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
EMOTIONAL, PROBABLY THE BEST WAY

138
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TO DESCRIBE IT.

139
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> KIDS EMOTIONAL, TEACHERS

140
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
EMOTIONAL.

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> EVERYBODY WAS EMOTIONAL.

142
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> WHAT WERE THEY SAYING.

143
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS PRETTY

144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
EMOTIONAL.
IT WAS EVERYBODY.

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THIS IS AKE EAFFECTED EVERY SIN

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PERSON THAT WAS THERE,

147
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
IMMEDIATELY.

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I SHOULDN'T SAY IMMEDIATELY.

149
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
VERY EARLY ON.

150
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS

151
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD.

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> AND I ALSO ASKED THESE TWO

153
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
MEN ABOUT ONE MOMENT OVER THE

154
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
LAST HOWEVER MANY HOURS THAT

155
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
REALLY SEARED INTO THEIR

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
MEMORIES AND THEY TOLD ME, AS

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
MANY PEOPLE DID, IT WAS THE

158
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
PARENTS, THE PARENTS FRIDAY

159
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
MORNING, THE PARENTS WAITING FOR

160
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THEIR CHILDREN, THE CHILDREN WHO

161
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
WOULD NEVER COME HOME.

162
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>> AS THE CHILDREN WERE COMING

163
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
DOWN THE STREET, YOU KNOW,

164
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
LITTLE BY LITTLE, CLASSROOM BY

165
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
CLASSROOM, HOWEVER THEY WERE

166
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
DOING IT, YOU KNOW, ALL HOLDING

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
HANDS, PARENTS WERE CLAIMING

168
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

169
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, ONCE THEY

170
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CLAIMED THEIR KID, SIGNED THEM

171
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
OUT, I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY

172
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WORKED IT, BUT THEY LEFT, THE

173
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
ONES THAT DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, YOU

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
NOTICED THERE IS SOME THAT ARE

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
STILL STICKING AROUND.

176
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT

177
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE

178
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
LEAVING.
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE

179
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
CONFIRMATION SOON ENOUGH THAT,

180
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

181
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BE GRABBING THEIR CHILD AND

182
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
HUGGING THEM AND TAKING THEM

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
HOME.

184
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THEIR LIFE IS CHANGED FOREVER.

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
>> YOU REALIZED THAT IN THAT

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
MOMENT?
>> YEAH.

187
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT, LIKE I

188
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SAID, A COUPLE OF TIMES WE HAD

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
TO GO BACK DOWN TO THAT STAGING

190
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AREA AND, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK

191
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AROUND AND YOU MAKE SURE THERE

192
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
IS NOBODY ELSE IN DISTRESS THAT

193
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
MIGHT NEED OUR ASSISTANCE, AND

194
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
YOU NOTICE THIS -- PARENTS BEEN

195
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
RIGHT THERE IN THE FRONT OF THE

196
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
LINE FOR TWO HOURS NOW, AND

197
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THERE IS NO MORE KIDS AROUND TO

198
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
TAKE HOME AND, YOU KNOW, YOU

199
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
KNOW THIS IS BAD, THEY'RE NOT --

200
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME BAD

201
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
NEWS.
AND I'M SURE THAT THEY AT THAT

202
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
POINT KNEW IT, BUT THERE IS THAT

203
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
SHRED OF HOPE THERE IS SOMEBODY

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
HIDING IN A CLOSET OR, YOU KNOW,

205
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THEY MISSED, BUT ULTIMATELY THAT

206
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
WASN'T THE CASE FOR ANY OF THEM.

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> AND, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS

208
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
TOUGH FOR THEM TO RECALL THOSE

209
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
MOMENTS, I DO JUST WANT TO LET

210
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LIGHTER

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MOMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
INTERVIEW WHEN THEY TALKED TO ME

213
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS PUTTING

214
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A SMILE ON A LOT OF KIDS' FACES

215
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000

216
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
TEDDY BEARS BY THE TRUCK LOADS,

217
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THEY TOLD ME.

218
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
LOAD, THE TRUCK LOAD, SENT TO

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THEM FROM FIRE AND EMS CREWS

220
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM THEM TO

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
HELP OUT IN NEWTOWN.

222
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
AS FAR AS THIS COMPUTER THAT THE

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
SHOOTER APPARENTLY SMASHED IN

240
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
HIS HOME BEFORE GOING OUT ON

241
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THIS GRIM RAMPAGE ON FRIDAY

242
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
MORNING.
DEB FEYERICK IS LIVE FOR US

243

THERE IN NEWTOWN WITH MORE ON

244
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THAT.

245
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
DEB, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

246
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> Reporter: WELL, BROOKE, WE

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
CAN TELL YOU INVESTIGATORS WERE

248
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
HERE AT THE HOME FOR ABOUT AN

249
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HOUR OR SO THIS AFTERNOON.

250
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THEY PULLED OUT JUST A LITTLE

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WHILE AGO.

252
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THEY HAVE BEEN RETURNING TO THE

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
HOUSE PERIODICALLY AS THEY GET

254
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
NEW LEADS AND AS THEY GET WIND

255
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

256
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THOSE

257
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ARE.
WE CAN TELL YOU WE HAVE

258
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
CONFIRMED WITH THE MEDICAL

259
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
EXAMINER THAT IN FACT TOXICOLOGY

260
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ADAM

261
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
LANZA.

262
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THOSE TOXICOLOGY REPORTS

263
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
EXPECTED BACK IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS

264
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
AND AT THAT POINT, THE DOCTORS

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
WILL KNOW BETTER WHETHER HE HAD

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
ANY SORT OF DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM.

267
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AND WHAT THOSE DRUGS MAY HAVE

268
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
BEEN.
WHETHER HE MAY HAVE BEEN TAKING

269
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ANY SORT OF DRUGS FOR

270
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, OR ANY

271
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ILLEGAL MEDICATIONS AS WELL.

272
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS TOLD BY

273
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
INVESTIGATORS THAT LANZA HAD

274
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME AND THE

275
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER IS TRYING TO

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
REALLY RUN THAT TO THE GROUND TO

277
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SEE WHETHER IN FACT THERE WAS

278
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY HAVE

279
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BEEN GOING ON, SOME OTHER

280
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEM THAT MAY

281
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
HAVE CAUSED THIS VIOLENT SPREE.

282
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THE BODIES OF ADAM LANZA AND HIS

283
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
MOTHER BOTH OF THEM AUTOPSIES

284
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WERE COMPLETED ON THAT.

285
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THE AUTOPSY REPORTS SHOWING THAT

286
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
NANCY LANZA WAS SHOT HERE, IN

287
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
HER HOME, AS SHE SLEPT, IN HER

288
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
BED, FOUR TIMES IN THE HEAD.

289
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AND THEN IT APPEARS THAT ADAM

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
LANZA TRIED TO DESTROY HIS

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
COMPUTER, DESTROY THE EVIDENCE,

292
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THE COMPUTER THAT INVESTIGATORS

293
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
FOUND WAS SMASHED INTO PIECES.

294
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE HARD DRIVE BADLY DAMAGED

295
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ACCORDING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT

296
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SOURCE.
AND THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE

297
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
TRYING TO RETRIEVE SOME OF THE

298
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
INFORMATION OFF OF THAT.

299
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
ALMOST AS IF ADAM LANZA WAS

300
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
TRYING TO ERASE HIS STEPS

301
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
LEADING UP TO THIS CRIME.

302
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
NOW, ALSO, WE'RE TOLD THE

303
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
AUTOPSY SHOWED THAT AFTER THE

304
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HORRIBLE SPREE AT THE SCHOOL,

305
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ADAM LANZA TOOK HIS OWN LIFE, A

306
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
SINGLE GUNSHOT WOUND ALSO TO THE

307
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HEAD.
WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT ALL

308
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
OF THIS IS THAT THE MOTHER,

309
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
NANCY LANZA, WAS IN CHARGE OF

310
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
ANY UNREIMBURSED PSYCHIATRIC OR

311
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPETENCES FOR

312
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HER SON.

313
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SO, AGAIN, ANOTHER INDICATION

314
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE

315
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GOING ON, THAT SHE WAS THE ONE

316
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WHO WAS REALLY TRYING TO MANAGE

317
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
WHATEVER IT WAS HE WAS WRESTLING

318
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WITH, THE DEMONS HE WAS -- HE

319
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
APPEARED TO BE STRUGGLING WITH

320
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST

321
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THREE YEARS.

322
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND, YOU KNOW, BROOKE WHAT IS SO

323
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
ASTONISHING TO ME HAVING COVERED

324
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A NUMBER OF TRAGEDIES, TERRIBLE

325
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, IS THAT

326
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ADAM LANZA, THE LAST THREE YEARS

327
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
OF HIS LIFE, THEY'RE BASICALLY A

328
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MYSTERY TO ALMOST EVERYBODY.

329
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
HE SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED

330
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AFTER COURSES HE TOOK IN 2009 AT

331
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
A LOCAL UNIVERSITY, BUT AFTER

332
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THAT, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN.

333
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THE MOTHER WAS TRYING TO

334
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
MAINSTREAM HIM, MOVING HIM FROM

335
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SCHOOL TO SCHOOL, BUT THE LAST

336
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THREE YEARS, THEY REALLY --

337
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THERE IS JUST -- THERE IS SO

338
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
LITTLE INFORMATION.

339
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
IT IS REALLY LIKE ANY -- IT IS

340
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
UNLIKE ANY OTHER SORT OF

341
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
SHOOTING, SHOOTING, TRAGEDY THAT

342
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'VE REPORTED ON.

343
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> IT IS SO BIZARRE HE'S SUCH A

344
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
MYSTERY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

345
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YEARS.
AND TALKING TO PEOPLE IN AND

346
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AROUND TOWN, SO MANY PEOPLE SO

347
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BADLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF

348
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THERE IS ANY KIND OF CONNECTION

349
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
BETWEEN THE SHOOTER AND THE

350
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SCHOOL.

351
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AND SO FAR, YOU KNOW, SO FAR AS

352
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
YOU'RE SAYING, NOTHING.

353
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I KNOW INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING

354
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
HARD.
DEBORAH FEYERICK, THANK YOU SO

355
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
MUCH.

356
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
WE JUST HAVE NOW --

357
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
>> THE ONE THING --

358
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> DEB, GO AHEAD.

359
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
JUMP BACK IN.
>> THE ONE QUICK THING WE WANT

360
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
TO CLARIFY, AGAIN, THIS IS ALSO

361
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WHAT IS SO FASCINATING, YOU

362
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE AS EASY

363
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
AS GOING TO THE SCHOOL RECORDS

364
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
AND SAYING, YES, OF COURSE HE

365
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
WAS HERE, THE SCHOOL HAS NOT

366
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT,

367
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OFFICIALS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

368
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
CONFIRM IT.

369
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A WOMAN WE SPOKE TO HERE IN TOWN

370
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000

THAT THE PRESIDENT'S LIAISON

517
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000

518
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000

SECURITY CHECKS SMALLER.

524
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
BUT BOTTOM LINE FROM THE

525
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
REPUBLICAN POINT OF VIEW, THEY

526
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
SAY, THE SPEAKER TOLD HIS CAUCUS

527
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
THIS MORNING, THAT THE PRESIDENT

528
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
IS NOT GIVING ENOUGH WHEN IT

529
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
COMES TO SPENDING CUTS AND WHEN

530
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
IT COMES TO REVENUE.

531
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THAT HE WANTS A VIRTUAL ONE TO

532
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ONE RATIO AND THE WAY THEY DO

533
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
THE MATH, THE REPUBLICANS DO THE

534
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
MATH, THEY SAY THEY DON'T THINK

535
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THEY'RE GETTING THAT.
THAT'S WHY HE'S PUSHING THIS

536
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
PLAN B.

537
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
>> SO WALK ME THROUGH PLAN B AND

538
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
WHY.

539
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> Reporter: PLAN B IS THE

540
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
SPEAKER WILL TRY TO CRAFT

541

PUT ON THE FLOOR AS SOON AS THIS

543

THURSDAY, SO IN TWO DAYS, WHICH

544
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
WOULD KEEP TAX CUTS WHERE THEY

545
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000

MILLION A YEAR.

549
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
WHY IS HE DOING THAT?

550
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT IS A

551
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TACTICAL MOVE.
HE AND THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO

552
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
REPUBLICANS TO GIVE LESS, SO TO

556
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SPEAK, ON TAX REVENUE.

557
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
SO IT IS DEFINITELY A TACTICAL

558
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
MOVE.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE LAUGHING IT

559
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OFF, LITERALLY.

560
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'VE HEARD FROM DEMOCRATIC

561
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SOURCES THAT IT IS MORE OF A

562
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
PUNCHLI LINE THAN A COMPROMISE.

563
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
IT IS UNCLEAR FILL IS IT

564
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
REPUBLICANS CAN GET THE VOTES IN

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THE HOUSE AND WE'RE TOLD THAT --

566
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'M TOLD BY REPUBLICAN SOURCES
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE YET

567
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000

CALL, WHIP THE VOTES TO MAKE

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
SURE THEY HAVE THE VOTES FOR

572
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
THIS THERE IS PROBABLY GOING TO

573
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
BE A SERIES OF VOTES ON

574
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THURSDAY, BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE
OF THAT.

575
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SENATE, WHERE

576
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
IT HAS TO GO NEXT, DEMOCRATS WHO

577
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
RUN THE SENATE THERE SAY THEY

578
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
JUST SIMPLY DON'T THINK IT IS

579
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
GOING TO PASS.

580
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000

NOTHING MORE.

585
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000

586
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ONE THING WE CAN AGREE ON, 14

587
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000

SAW A DOG HERE, THEY WERE THE

689
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
FIRST SMILES I SAW ON ANYONE'S

690
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
FACES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

691
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
IT STARTS WITH MAKING EYE

692
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
CONTACT AFTER SEEING THE DOGS

693
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND THE SMILES HAPPEN AND

694
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THEN --

695
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
>> HEY.

696
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
YEAH.
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT SMILE WHEN

697
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
YOU SEE THESE GUYS AND THEY'RE

698
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
SO NICE, EVERYBODY'S PETTING
THEM.

699
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I WANT TO REMIND THE VIEWERS

700
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000

701
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE SPENCER

703
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
AND WENDY COMING TO HELP OUT.

704
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I WANT TO SAY THE KIDS AT

705
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
NEWTOWN SCHOOLS, THEY HAVE

706
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
GOTTEN BACK TO SCHOOL, BUT NOT

707
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOLS.
NOT SURE WHEN THE SANDY HOOK

708
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SCHOOLS WILL GO BACK, BUT

709
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE EXTRA

710
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
COUNSELORS, EXTRA POLICE

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
OFFICERS ON HAND AT SCHOOLS

712
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
TODAY AND UNTIL THEY GO BREAK

713
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
AND ALSO THE TEACHERS UNION HERE

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
PEOPLE TO TALK TO THE STUDENTS,

717
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS AGE

718
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
APPROPRIATE THAT THEY'LL TALK TO

719
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THEM.
BUT, AGAIN, NOT EXACTLY SURE

720
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
WHEN THE SANDY HOOK STUDENTS

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000

722
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000

CALLED "GUARDIAN OF DREAMS,"

727
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
RIGHT?

728
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> YES.
>> WHY IS THIS A GOOD RESOURCE

729
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
FOR KIDS.

730
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SHOW THE BOOK.
>> IT IS A GOOD RESOURCE FOR

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
KIDS BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN

732
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AFTER 9/11 WHEN CHILDREN WERE

733
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
HAVING A LOT OF NIGHTMARES.

734
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000

735
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000

00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
VOLUME AGAIN.

739
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
>> YOU SAID KIDS WHO HAVE DEALT

740
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WITH A LOT OF TRAUMA IN THEIR

741
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
LIVES AND THAT WAS THE IMPETUS

742
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
BEHIND THIS.
THAT'S WHY YOU DID IT.

743
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

744
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>> YOU FIND IT HELPS.

745
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> YES, I HAVE.

746
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF FEEDBACK

747
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
FROM COUNSELORS AND PARENTS WHO

748
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
USED THE BOOK TO HELP THEIR

749
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
CHILDREN DEAL WITH THEIR ISSUES

750
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
AND DISAPPEAR THAT NIGHTMARE WAY

751
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AND CREATE ANOTHER IMAGE IN ITS

752
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
PLACE.
>> YOU'RE A FORMER NEW YORK CITY

753
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
POLICE OFFICER?

754
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> HOW DID YOU PREPARE WHEN YOU

755
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
WERE A POLICE OFFICER FOR

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
TRAUMATIC EVENTS LIKE THIS?

757
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
BECAUSE, BROOKE BALDWIN HAS BEEN

758
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
TALKING TO THE RESCUERS AND THEY

759
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
ARE VERY EMOTIONAL.

760
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY

761
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
SAW.

762
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
SO HOW DID YOU PREPARE WHEN YOU

763
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WERE DOING THAT?
>> IT IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING

764
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YOU CAN PREPARE FOR.

765
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
AND REALLY IT IS THE -- IT IS IN

766
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
THE MOMENT.

767
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT

768
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL -- TO

769
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
EXPRESS YOUR EMOTIONS AT THAT --

770
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IN THAT MOMENT IN TIME.

771
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
IT IS ONLY AFTERWARDS REALLY YOU

772
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
HAVE A CHANCE TO PROCESS IT.

773
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YESTERDAY

774
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
YOU MET WITH GRIEF COUNSELORS AT

775
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
VARIOUS SCHOOLS.

776
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
>> AT THE GRIEVING CENTER, YES.

777
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
>> AT THE GRIEVING CENTER.

778
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

779
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
>> BASICALLY I DONATED SOME

780
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
BOOKS THERE SO THEY HAD THE

781
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT WITH THE

782
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000

783
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
FOR THEM TO USE THE BOOK THAT

784
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000

785
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000

BECAUSE --
>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE HERE.

788
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
IT IS IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO

FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE

790
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO BE

791
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
HELPFUL TO THE COMMUNITY HERE.

792
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> LET'S SEE THE BOOK.

793
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

794
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
IS IT PICTURES OR STORIES OR

WHO WAKES UP FROM A NIGHTMARE.

>> YEAH.

800
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000

807
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
IMPORTANT.

IT'S AMAZING.

813
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I WAS SITTING HAVING LUNCH A

814
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
MOMENT AGO AND SOMEONE WALKED IN

815
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
JUST WITH A BOX OF THESE,

816
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
PRINTED THEM, SAYS WE ARE SANDY

817
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
HOOK, WE CHOOSE LOVE.

818
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I WANT ONE TO PUT IN THE WINDOW

822
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000

AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING

823
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
HERE.

824
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THEY'RE CHOOSING LOVE INSTEAD OF

825

921
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000

922
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
RIFLE, THIS BUSHMASTER RIFLE, IT

923
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
IS OWNED BY A PRIVATE INVESTMENT

924
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
GROUP.
WHAT IS THE STORY HERE?

925
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
>> WELL, BROOKE, THE PRIVATE

926
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
INVESTMENT GROUP IS CALLED

927
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SERBRUS.

928
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO SELL

929
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
THAT WEAPONS COMPANY.

930
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
BUT NOW THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

931
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000

932
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
INVESTOR IN THAT FUND AND MAKING

933
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THEM AN INDIRECT INVESTOR IN THE

934
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MAKER OF BUSHMASTER RIFLES.

935
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS A BIT

936
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
OF AN ISSUE HERE.

937
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I WANT TO GO TO DON PRIMAC OF

CALIFORNIA TEACHERS UNION BECOME

941
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
INVOLVED IN THIS SORT OF

942
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
INVESTMENT THING WITH A COMPANY

943
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THAT MAKES BUSHMASTER RIFLE?

944
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
>> THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

945
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
PENSION, THE LARGEST PENSION FOR

946
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS IN

947
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
AMERICA, IT INVESTS A LOT IN

948
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS THAT DO

949
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH CARE TO

950
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
RETAIL TO MANUFACTURING.

951
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
SERBRUS IS A DIVERSIFIED FUNDS.

952
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
THOSE FUNDS INVESTED IN FREEDOM

953
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
GROUP OR CREATED FREEDOM GROUP,

954
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
THEY BOUGHT BUSHMASTER AND

955
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
STARTED ADDING ON, ADDING ON TO

956
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
MAKE WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE

957
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LARGEST U.S. GUN MANUFACTURER.

958
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> SO, DAN, IS THIS LIKE WHEN

959
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
YOU INVEST IN YOUR 401(k) OR

960
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
WHATEVER, WHATEVER INVESTMENT

961
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
YOU MIGHT HAVE, AND IT IS IN A

962
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
MUTUAL FUND AND YOU DON'T KNOW

963
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
WHICH COMPANIES ARE IN THAT

964
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
MUTUAL FUND.

965
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
IS THAT HOW IT IS OR DID THEY

966
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS

967
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
COMPANY WAS A MAKER OF THESE

968
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
RIFLES?

969
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
>> NO, IT IS DIFFERENT.

970
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
FIRST OF ALL, IT IS DIFFERENT

971
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
BECAUSE OF THE LONG-TERM

972
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
INVESTMENT.
UNLIKE YOUR 401(k), IF YOU

973
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
WANTED TO PULL YOUR MONEY OUT,

974
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
YOU CAN'T.

975
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU'RE IN,

976
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
UNLESS YOU DID A PRIVATE SALE

977
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

978
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
BUT THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN IT.

979
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THESE ARE LARGE TRANSACTIONS,

980
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AND FOR CALLISTERS WHICH

981
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
COMMITTED $500 MILLION TO ONE OF

982
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THESE FUNDS THEY DON'T GIVE A

983
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
$500 MILLION CHECK UP FRONT.

984
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THEY SAY WE'LL GIVE YOU THIS

985
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
MONEY AND EVERY TIME THEY DO A

986
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
DEAL, IT ASKS FOR A PIECE OF THE

987
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
MONEY TO DO THE DEAL, IN THE

988
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
CASE OF FREEDOM GROUP, THEY

989
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR MONEY TO DO

990
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
BUSHMASTER AND SO ON.

991
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
PLUS, FREEDOM GROUP FILED TO GO

992
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
PUBLIC IN 2009.

993
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
CALLISTERS WOULD HAVE KNOWN
ABOUT THAT AND GOTTEN QUARTERLY

994
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
UPDATES FROM THE FIRM.
>> SO, DAN, LET ME ASK YOU, WHY

995
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
IS CERBERUS SELLING THE COMPANY

996
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THAT MAKES THE GUNS AND THE

997
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
AMMUNITION?
>> THEY HAVEN'T EXACTLY

998
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
EXPLAINED IT.

999
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THEY PUT OUT A STATE THIS

1000
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
MORNING SAYING THEY FEEL WHAT

1001
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN, IS A,

1002
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
QUOTE, THEIR TERM, A WATER SHED

1003
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
EVENT AND CAUSED THEM TO

1004
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
RECONSIDER.
IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT

1005
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DECISION.
IN ALL MY TIME COVERING PRIVATE

1006
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
EQUITY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I

1007
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
BELIEVE I'VE SEEN A PRIVATE

1008
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
EQUITY FIRM DECIDE TO SELL A

1009
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
COMPANY, A LARGE COMPANY, FOR

1010
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
SOMETHING OTHER THAN INVESTMENT.

1011
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
BECAUSE CLEARLY THIS IS NOT A
GOOD TIME TO SELL A GUN COMPANY.

1012
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THEY CLEARLY BELIEVE THAT

1013
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
WHETHER IT IS FROM PRESSURE FROM

1014
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
INVESTORS LIKE THE TEACHERS

1015
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
PENSION, WHICH APPARENTLY CALLED

1016
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
CERBERUS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

1017
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
AFTER OUR ORIGINAL REPORT OR

1018
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
OTHER INVESTORS, THEY'RE GETTING

1019
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
PRESSURE ON THIS FUND AND
THEY'RE PROBABLY CONCERNED THEY

1020
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
WON'T BE ABLE TO RAISE MORE

1021
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
MONEY IN THE FUTURE FROM THESE

1022
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
PENSIONS AND THESE ENDOWMENTS IF

1023
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THEY DON'T DO SOMETHING HERE.

1024
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
PLUS, ONE FINAL THING, THE

1025
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
FOUNDER AND CEO, STEVE FEINBERG,

1026
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000

IF THEY HAVE INVESTMENTS IN
THESE COMPANIES AND AS YOU SAID,

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
NOT A GOOD TIME NOW TO HAVE --

1035
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
TO BE A COMPANY THAT MAKES GUNS,

1036
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000

THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

1066
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We were going through so much
of the bargain detergent.

1067
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And the clothes
didn't look as good.

1068
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But since we switched to Tide
we use much less.

1069

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
RICHARD ENGLE AND HIS TEAM WERE

1276
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
MISSING.
NBC NEWS ASKED US NOT TO REPORT

1277
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
THE NEWS AND, OF COURSE, WE

1278
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
COMPLIED WITH THAT REQUEST.

1279
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
CNN HAS COMPLIED WITH SUCH

1280
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
REQUESTS BEFORE AND LIKELY WILL

1281
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
AGAIN.
OFTENTIMES IN FIRST COUPLE OF

1282
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
DAYS AFTER A NONCOMBATANT GOES

1283
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
MISSING, BE IT A JOURNALIST, A

1284
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
MEMBER OF A NONGOVERNMENT

1285
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ORGANIZATION OR A COMPANY

1286
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
EMPLOYEE, CNN IS ASKED, AS ARE

1287
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, TO

1288
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
DELAY REPORTING THE STORY.

1289
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
THE REASON IS SO THAT FACT

1290
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
FINDING AND NEGOTIATIONS TO FREE

1291
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THEM CAN TAKE PLACE BEFORE THEIR

1292
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
CAPTURE BECOMES A WORLDWIDE NEWS

1293
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
EVENT.

1294
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS SAY THAT

1295
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
ONCE THE GLOBAL SPOTLIGHT IS ON

1296
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THE MISSING, THE HOSTAGES

1297
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
VALUE -- THE VALUE OF THESE MEN

1298
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
AND WOMEN MAKING IT MUCH, MUCH

1299
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
MORE DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE

1300
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THEIR FREEDOM.

1301
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
>>> HAWAII AND THE REST OF THE

1302
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000

1303
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000

1310
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
DEATH YESTERDAY.

1311
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
HAWAII'S DANIEL INOUYE RANKED

1312
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
THIRD IN THE LINE OF

1313
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
HE WAS THE SENATE PRO TEM, THE

1314
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
SENIOR MEMBER OF THE SENATE'S

1315
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
MAJORITY PARTY, HAVING SERVED 50

1316
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
YEARS DURING HIS HALF CENTURY IN

1317
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
OFFICE.
INOUYE MADE MANY, MANY FRIENDS,

1318
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
LOTS HAPPEN.

1319
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
BUT MADE REMARKABLY LITTLE

1320
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
NOISE.
INITIALLY BARRED FROM SERVING IN

1321
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
WORLD WAR II BECAUSE OF HIS

1322
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
JAPANESE ROOTS, HE PETITIONED TO

1323
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
GET HIMSELF INTO THE ARMY, WOUND

1324
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
UP LOSING AN ARM, FOUGHT WITH

1325
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
SUCH DISTINCTION THAT HE EARNED

1326
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THE MEDAL OF HONOR.

1327
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
HE WAS FIRST ELECTED TO CONGRESS

1328
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
BACK IN 1959, THE YEAR HAWAII

1329
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BECAME A STATE.

1330
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
AND EARNED SUCH RESPECT HE WAS

1331
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
NAMED TO COMMITTEE THAT

1332
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
INVESTIGATED WATERGATE,

1333
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
INVESTIGATED THE IRAN/CONTRA,

1334
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
ALSO ROSE TO THE TOP OF THE

1335
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
POWERFUL SENATE APPROPRIATIONS

1336
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000

STEER FEDERAL DOLLARS TO HIS

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
BELOVED HAWAII.

1339
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
HE DIED OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE.

1340
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
HIS OFFICE SAYS HIS FINAL WORD

1341
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
WAS, ALOHA.

1342
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
>>> AND BACK TO NEWTOWN,

DON LEMON STANDING BY.

1344
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
HEY, DON.

1345
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000

1346
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME THINGS

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.

1348

SOME LADIES SHOWED UP AND

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THEY'RE PUTTING CANDLES IN THE

DIRT, STICKING THEM DOWN IN THE

1351

GROUND.

1352
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
PEOPLE ARE WRITING CARDS AS WELL

1353
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
AS THEY DROP OFF TEDDY BEARS.

1354
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
HERE IS ONE TO CATHERINE

1355
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
HUBBARD, ONE OF THE VICTIMS, ONE

1356
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
FOR EMILIE PARKER.

1357
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I CAN SEE INSIDE, WITHOUT EVEN

1358
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OPENING IT, I CAN SEE THERE SAY

1359
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
SNOWMAN ON IT, A CHRISTMAS CARD

1360
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
FOR THEM.

1361
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ONE FOR BENJAMIN WHEELER AS

1362
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
WELL.

1363
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
ONE OF THE VICTIMS AS WELL.

1364
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
AND THERE IS ALSO -- MORE THINGS

1365
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
IN THERE, NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT

1366
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
IT IS AND I'M NOT THE ONE TO

1367
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
OPEN IT UP.

1368
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'M SURE ALL OF THIS, IF THE

1369
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
RAIN DOESN'T TAKE IT WAY, WILL

1370
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
BE GIVEN TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS

1371
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN TIME, IN TIME.

1372
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO TAKE A

1373
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
WHILE BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN BE

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
ABLE TO ACCEPT AND RECEIVE ALL

1375
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
OF THIS.

1376
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE FROM

TONIGHT OUR GUEST,

1385
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
PROFESSOR SARGENT,
CAN YOU TELL ME

1386
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
WHAT CD RATES WILL
BE IN TWO YEARS?

1387
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
NO.

1388
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
IF HE CAN'T, NO ONE CAN.

1389
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THAT'S WHY ALLY HAS
A RAISE YOUR RATE CD.

1390
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
ALLY BANK.

1391
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
YOUR MONEY NEEDS AN ALLY.

1392
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
>>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING

1393
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THE MOST FROM YOUR MONEY.

1394
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WE ALL WANT TO DO THAT.

1395
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
WITH ME THIS HOUR, LYNETTE C

1396
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
CALFAWNY COX AND DAVID NOVAK.

1397
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
>> WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET

1398
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
10% ON MY MONEY?

1399
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
>> WOULDN'T WE ALL LIKE TO KNOW?

1400
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
WOULDN'T WE ALL LIKE TO KNOW?

1401
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
>> TALL ORDER.

1402
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'LL BE NICE.

1403
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE REALISTIC

1404
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
EXPECTATIONS, SO FAR.

1405
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I SAW HE WAS AN ELDERLY

1406
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
GENTLEMAN.
IF YOU'RE USED TO GETTING A

1407
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS, YOU

1408
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
HAVE TO TAKE ON MORE RISK.

1409
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THERE IS NO WAY TO DO THAT.

1410
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
AND IT IS NOT GUARANTEED.

1411
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE STOCKS,

1412
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
GROWTH STOCKS, MUTUAL FUNDS ARE

1413
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
AN OPTION, OF COURSE.

1414
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
BUT RECOGNIZE THERE REALLY IS A

1415
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RISK AND

1416
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
REWARD.
THE HIGHER THE RETURNS THAT YOU

1417
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WANT TO GENERATE, 10% IS PRETTY

1418
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
HIGH IN THIS MARKET, THE MORE

1419
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
RISK YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO

1420
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
TAKE ON.
>> MAYBE HE'LL GET 10% ON 25% OF

1421
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
HIS INVESTMENTS AND BE

1422
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
CONSERVATIVE WITH THE REST.

1423
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
>> RIGHT.

1424
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
>> THAT'S AN OPTION.

1425
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO BE

1426
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
CAREFUL ABOUT IS IF HE REALLY

1427
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WANTS TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND

1428
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
INVEST IN STOCKS, HE NEEDS TO

1429
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS SOMETHING

1430
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THAT HAS TO BE FOR THE

1431
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
LONG-TERM.
AND THAT HE NEEDS TO HOLD IT AND

1432
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE GOING UP

1433
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
AND DOWN A BIT IN A GIVEN YEAR,

1434
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
IF HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH THAT,

1435
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET CLOSER TO

1436
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
WHAT HE WANTS.

1437
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
IF HE'S NOT, IT IS PROBABLY NOT

1438
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
LIKELY.
>> APPRECIATE IT.

1454
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
MEMORIAL HONORING VICTIMS, A

1455
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
FORMER SCHOOLMATE OF THE ALLEGED

1456
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
KILLER.
WHEN YOU THINK OF THIS, DOES

1457
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
YOUR MIND GO TO YOUR FRIEND?

1458
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
>> OBVIOUSLY IT DOES BECAUSE,

1459
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
YOU KNOW, HE'S A VERY BIG PART

1460
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
IN THIS EVENT.

1461
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO

1462
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THINK OF IT.

1463
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
>> Reporter: SADLY HE'S THE

1464
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
REASON FOR IT.
>> YEAH.

1465
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
>> Reporter: ALAN DIAZ MAY HAVE

1466
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
BEEN AS CLOSE AS ANYONE COULD

1467
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
COME TO BEING A FRIEND OF ADAM

1468
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
LANZA WHEN HE WAS A SOPHOMORE AT

1469
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL AND DIAZ WAS

1470
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
A FRESHMAN IN 2008.

1471
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON, HE

1472
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
REALLY WAS.

1473
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THE WAY HE ACTED AROUND OTHER

1474
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
PEOPLE WAS JUST VERY WITHDRAWN

1475
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
AND REALLY QUIET.

1476
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
>> Reporter: A LITTLE DIFFERENT?

1477
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
>> YEAH.

1478
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> Reporter: THEY WERE IN THE

1479
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
HIGH SCHOOL TECH CLUB TOGETHER,

1480
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON

1481
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
COMPUTERS.
ADAM HAD HIS OWN STYLE OF

1482
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
DRESSING.

1483
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
>> HE HAD THE STEREOTYPICAL NERD

1484
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
LOOK, LIKE, KHAKI PANTS, BELT,

1485
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
TUCKED IN SHIRT, EVEN HAD A

1486
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
LITTLE COMPUTER CASE, LIKE A

1487
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
BRIEF CASE INSTEAD OF A BACKPACK

1488
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

1489
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
HE EVEN HAD A LITTLE POCKET

1490
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
PROTECTOR HE HAD PENS IN.

1491
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
>> Reporter: HE DOESN'T KNOW

1492
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
WHETHER LANZA WAS BULLIED.

1493
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

1494
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
>> WE ALL KIND OF KNEW THAT,

1495
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE HAD PROBLEMS

1496
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SOCIALLY.
AND WE KIND OF HAD A FEELING

1497
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1498
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM, BUT WE

1499
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
NEVER ASKED, NEVER THOUGHT IT

1500
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WAS OUR PLACE TO DO SO.

1501
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
>> Reporter: BACK THEN HIS

1502
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
SCHOOLMATE'S MOM ONCE INVITED

1503
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
ALL HIS FRIENDS TO THE HOUSE TO

1504
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

1505
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
ONE WAS STAR CRAFT, KIND OF A

1506
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
WAR GAMES IN SPACE.

1507
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
ANOTHER WAS WAR CRAFT 3, WHERE

1508
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
AS THE AD SAYS, SURVIVAL IS A

1509
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
MATTER OF STRATEGY.

1510
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
>> THE BURNING SHADOW COMES TO

1511
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CONSUME US ALL.

1512
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> WAR CRAFT 3 WAS REALLY FUN.

1513
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
SO, YOU KNOW, HE WAS REALLY INTO

1514
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
GAMES AND IF I RECALL HE

1515
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
ACTUALLY PICKED UP ON STAR CRAFT

1516
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
REALLY QUICKLY.

1517
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
>> Reporter: WHEN LANZA LEFT

1518
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS HOME

1519
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
SCHOOLED, DIAZ LOST TOUCH.

1520
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
BUT HE RAN INTO LANZA'S MOTHER

1521
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
NANCY ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

1522
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> I REMEMBER HER, LIKE,

1523
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
MENTIONING THAT HE STARTED GOING

1524
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
TO THE SHOOTING RANGE WITH HER

1525
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
AND MY INITIAL RESPONSE TO THAT

1526
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
WAS, I NEVER REALLY IMAGINED

1527
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
ADAM ONE TO EVER EVEN HOLD A

1528
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
GUN.
>> Reporter: WHY DO YOU SAY

1529
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1530
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
MAYBE BECAUSE IN MY MIND I DON'T

1531
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
IMAGINE SHY, QUIET PEOPLE, YOU

1532
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
KNOW, GOING TO A SHOOTING RANGE.

1533
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I NEVER REALLY CAN MAKE THAT

1534
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
ASSOCIATION.
>> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS ARE

1535
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
TRACKING HOW OFTEN LANZA HAD

1536
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
BEEN TO GUN RANGES.

1537
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THEY DON'T YET KNOW HOW MANY SO

1538
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
FAR.

1539
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THEY HAVE PROVEN HE'S BEEN TO

1540
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
TARGET PRACTICE ABOUT SIX MONTHS

1541
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
AGO.

1542
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS MOTHER AND

1543
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
SON WENT AT LEAST ONCE TOGETHER.

1544
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
ALAN'S OLDER SISTER WENT TO

1545
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
SCHOOL WITH THE SHOOTER'S OLDER

1546
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
BROTHER.
AND SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH HER

1547
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
MOTHER WHO WENT TO HER BRIDAL

1548
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
SHOWER LAST YEAR.

1549
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
>> WHY HER?

1550
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
SHE WAS JUST -- IT WAS A SHOCK.

1551
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS A HAPPY PERSON.

1552
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
>> Reporter: DO YOU NOW THINK OF

1553
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
HIM AS AN EVIL PERSON?

1554
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID?

1555
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
>> AT ONE POINT HE WAS A GOOD

1556
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
KID.
THE EVENTS THAT HE DID THAT DAY

1557
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
MAY HAVE BEEN EVIL, BUT BEFORE

1558
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THEN, HE WAS JUST ANOTHER KID.

1559
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
>> Reporter: UNTIL SOMETHING

1560
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
MADE HIM SNAP.

1561
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN, NEWTOWN,

1562
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
CONNECTICUT.

1563
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
>> ALL RIGHT, SUSAN.

1564
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
AND, BROOKE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE,

1565
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THE MORE THEY HEAR ABOUT THE

1566
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
SHOOTER, THE MORE DETAILS, EVEN

1567
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
US, WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

1568
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
WHY.

1569
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
BEFORE I GO BACK TO YOU IN

1570
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
ATLANTA, I WANT TO SAY YOU SAW

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
WALKING UP TO US AND YOU WALKED

1573
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
UP TO US.
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

1574
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
>> JAMIE.

1575
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
>> YOU'RE OVERCOME.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN OUT HERE?

1576
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
>> I'VE BEEN OUT HERE ALL DAY.

1577
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
JUST TRYING TO LEAVE A LITTLE

1578
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SOMETHING AT EACH MEMORIAL FOR

1579
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
THE KIDS.

1580
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
AND FOR THE VICTIMS.

1581
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
>> YEAH.

1582
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY TO US?

1583
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
>> I JUST -- I JUST CAN'T

1584
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
BELIEVE THAT THIS KIND OF A

1585
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
TRAGEDY COULD HAPPEN.

1586
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
AND JUST WALKING THROUGH THE

1587
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
TOWN, I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS SO

1588
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
BEAUTIFUL.

1589
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
AND THERE IS SO MUCH LOVE HERE.

1590
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
BUT IT'S SO HARD.

1591
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT LIVE

1592
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
HERE.
AND THANK GOD THEIR KIDS ARE

1593
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
OKAY.

1594
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BUT THIS IS JUST MIND BLOWING.

1595
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
AND THE MOST THAT I CAN DO IS

1596
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
JUST COME DOWN AND SHOW SUPPORT

1597
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
FOR ANYBODY WHO NEEDS ANYTHING.

1598
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
>> WELL, THANK YOU.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1606
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's hard to see opportunity

1607
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
in today's challenging
environment.

1608
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Unless you have the right
perspective.

1609
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management
has the vision

1610
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000

the obvious.

1611

We'll uncover opportunities,
find hidden risk,

1612
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and make success a reality.

GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

MORE YOUNG VICTIMS ARE BEING

>> JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE, I

1783
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000

IS THAT A PROTECTIVE MEASURE?

1804
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
IS THAT THE NEW NORMAL?

1805
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
NORMAL.
IT MAY BE THE WAY WE HAVE TO

1812
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
TAKE ACTION IN THE FUTURE.

1813
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
>> SO, KATE, WHEN IS THE SCHOOL

1814
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
GOING TO BE READY?

1815
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
DO WE KNOW?
>> THAT'S BEEN A QUESTION AS

1816
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
WELL.
WE SPOKE WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL

1817
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
FOR AN UPDATE.

1818
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
ORIGINALLY YESTERDAY THEY

1819
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
BELIEVED THE BUILDING COULD BE

1820
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
READY AS EARLY AS TODAY.

1821
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
AND THEN UP TO NEWTOWN SCHOOL

1822
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
OFFICIALS WHEN THEY'RE READY TO

1823
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
START CLASSES.
BUT THE UPDATE IS THEY'RE STILL

1824
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
WORKING ON GETTING THE BUILDING

1825
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
RECERTIFIED, GETTING THINGS LIKE

1826
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
FIRE ALARMS, DOOR LOCKS,

1827
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS UPDATED TO BE
READY FOR THE KIDS.

1828
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
AND THE BUILDING WILL BE READY

1829
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
MORE LIKELY TOWARD LATER IN THE

1830
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
WEEK BUT WE KNOW WHEN THEIR

1831
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
START DATE IS, THE BUILDING WILL

1832
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
BE READY FOR SANDY HOOK AT THE

1833
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.
>> LET'S STEP OUT HERE AND TALK

1834
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
AND LET THE PHOTOGRAPHER GO

1835
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
OVER.
YOU CAN SEE -- LOOK AT THE

1836
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
EXPENSIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND SOME

1837
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
MONKS HERE ON THE SCENE.

1838
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
WE'LL SEE MORE PEOPLE SHOW UP

1839
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING FROM

1840
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
WORK.
IN A MOMENT OF TRANSPARENCY, IT

1841
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
HAS BEEN NOTHING NEARLY AS TOUGH

1842
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
AS WHAT THE FAMILIES ARE DEALING

1843
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
WITH HERE.

1844
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
BUT OUR COLLEAGUE, WOLF BLITZER,

1845
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
SUCH AN AMAZING MAN, HE KNEW

1846
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
THIS WAS VERY STRESSFUL FOR ALL

1847
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
OF US.

1848
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
TOOK US TO DIFFERENT LAST NIGHT.

1849
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
WE WERE AT DINNER AND WE WERE

1850
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
TALKING JUST ABOUT HOW TOUGH IT

1851
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
IS SEEING THESE FAMILIES AND

1852
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
EVEN THE RESCUE WORKERS.

1853
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
AS YOU'VE BEEN AROUND TOWN TODAY

1854
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
AND THE FUNERALS STARTED

1855
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
YESTERDAY, AND TWO TODAY, WHAT

1856
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
HAS BEEN YOUR BIGGEST

1857
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
IMPRESSION?
>> MY BIGGEST IMPRESSION THE

1858
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
ENTIRE TIME WE HAVE BEEN HERE,

1859
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
YOU SEE IT HERE AND YOU SAW THE

1860
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
MEMORIAL STARTED AS SMALL

1861
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
MEMORIAL TO THE VICTIMS, AND

1862
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
LOOK WHAT IT HAS GROWN INTO.

1863
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
AN ENTIRE BLOCK AT THIS POINT.

1864
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
IT CONTINUES TO GROW.

1865
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
MY BIG IMPRESSION AS WE HAVE

1866
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
BEEN HERE AND I'M HONORED TO BE

1867
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
HERE WITH THIS COMMUNITY IS HOW

1868
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
CLOSE THE COMMUNITY IS.

1869
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'VE HEARD MORE AND MORE OFTEN

1870
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
THAN NOT THAT SANDY HOOK, THE

1871
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
TOWN, DOES NOT WANT TO BE

1872
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
REMEMBERED AS THE TRAGEDY.

1873
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THEY WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS

1874
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
THE COMMUNITY THAT CAME TOGETHER

1875
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
AND THEIR STRENGTH AND THEY

1876
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE EVIL AND

1877
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
THE TRAGEDY AND THEY WERE

1878
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
TOGETHER AND THEY BECAME

1879
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
STRONGER AND HEALED ALL TOGETHER

1880
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
FOR IT.
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW,

1881
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
IT HAS BEEN REAL.

1882
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING -- I'VE BEEN

1883
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
ON THE VERGE OF TEARS AND CRIED

1884
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
PRIVATELY.

1885
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
BUT TODAY, AS I WAS COMING IN, I

1886
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
TOLD OUR VIEWERS EARLIER, I

1887
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
PASSED A FUNERAL PROCESSION.

1888
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
AND HAD TO PULL OVER AND STOP.

1889
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH ONE OF

1890
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
THE PRODUCERS AND I JUST STOPPED

1891
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
AND PUT PHONE DOWN AND SEE THE

1892
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
FACES OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE OF

1893
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
THE CARS IN THE FUNERAL

1894
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
PROCESSION.
STANDING HERE EARLIER IN THE

1895
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
BACK, I KNOW IS TERRIBLE TO SAY,
BUT JUST A LITTLE WHITE CASKET

1896
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
AND YOU REALIZE HOW -- IT IS

1897
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
UNFATHOMABLE.
>> AND YOU REALIZE THAT AT

1898
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
VARIOUS DIFFERENT STEPS, IT HIT

1899
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
ME WHEN I SAW A MOTHER AND HER

1900
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
CHILD IN A CAFE AND SAW THIS

1901
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
SMALL CHILD, THE SAME AGE AS THE

1902
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
KIDS THAT WERE IN THE CLASSROOM,

1903
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
AND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE SMALL,

1904
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
SMALL CASKETS, IT IS, YOU KNOW,

1905
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
IT IS ONE REMINDER AFTER ANOTHER

1906
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
OF JUST HOW HORRIFIC AND WE

1907
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
HEARD IT ON AIR, WE HEARD IT

1908
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
FROM EVERYONE WE TALKED TO,

1909
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS AND THAT IS

1910
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
THE TRUTH.

1911
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
>> YEAH.

1912
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
BROOKE, I'M SURE THE SAME

1913
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
SENTIMENT AS YOU'RE WALKING

1914
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
AROUND, BROOKE, YOU HAD A VERY

1915
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
MOVING PIECE WITH SOME OF THE

1916
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
RESCUE WORKERS AND YOU SEE

1917
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
THESE, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING,

1918
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
THESE BIG LUG OF A GUY WILL COME

1919
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
UP TO YOU AND SAY, OH, MY GOD,

1920
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
AND BARELY GET THEIR WORDS OUT

1921
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
AND THEY START CRYING.
>> A LOT OF THEM DON'T WANT TO

1922
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO FORCE WORDS OUT

1923
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
OF THEM RIGHT NOW.

1924
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

1925
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I FLEW BACK THIS MORNING, SPENT

1926
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
DINNER TIME WITH TWO VOLUNTEER

1927
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
FIREFIGHTERS ACTUALLY WHO, YOU

1928
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
KNOW, FRIDAY MORNING, THEY WERE

1929
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
IN THEIR DAY JOB MODE, HEARD

1930
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
WHAT HAPPENED, CALL CAME IN AND

1931
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
WENT INTO FIREFIGHTER MODE.

1932
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
ROB AND RAY.

1933
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
THEY SERVED THE COMMUNITY IN

1934
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
NEWTOWN FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS

1935
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
EACH.

1936
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
BUT THE MORNING THEY GOT THE

1937
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
CALL, THEY SAID NOTHING,

1938
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
NOTHING, NOTHING COULD HAVE

1939
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
PREPARED THEM FOR WHAT THEY SAW.

1940
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
HOW LONG HAVE YOU ALL BEEN

1941
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
VOLUNTEERING AS FIREFIGHTERS?

1942
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
>> I'VE GOT 21 YEARS IN.

1943
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
>> ALMOST 25.

1944
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
>> AND WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY?

1945
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
>> I WAS WORKING PROBABLY ABOUT

1946
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
2,000 FEET FROM THE SCHOOL, ON A

1947
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
STONE WALL, IN THE BUSINESS

1948
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
DISTRICT IN THE CENTER OF SANDY

1949
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
HOOK.
SO MY RESPONSE TIME WAS VERY

1950
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
QUICK.
I WAS THERE VERY SOON.

1951
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
>> SO YOU WERE THERE.

1952
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
>> MM-HMM.

1953
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
>> DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

1954
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
YOU WERE WALKING INTO?

1955
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
>> NO.
>> NOT AT ALL.

1956
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
MATTER OF FACT, WE WERE JUST

1957
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
TALKING ABOUT THAT, WE HAD A

1958
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
FIRE CALL A FEW MINUTES AGO, AND

1959
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT ON

1960
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
THE WAY BACK, AND WE WERE -- YOU

1961
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
GET THE INITIAL DISPATCH AND YOU

1962
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

1963
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
COMING INTO.

1964
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
BUT FOR THE MOST PART, YOU'RE

1965
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
READY FOR IT.

1966
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
AND THIS TIME, THAT'S NOT THE

1967
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
CASE.
>> YOU'RE NEVER READY FOR THIS.

1968
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
>> NO.

1969
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
NOBODY -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY,

1970
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
ANYBODY ANYWHERE, IF THEY TELL

1971
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
YOU THEY'RE READY FOR SOMETHING

1972
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
LIKE THIS, THEY'RE NOT BEING

1973
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
HONEST WITH YOU.

1974
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
>> DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

1975
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
SPECIFICS, BUT HELP US

1976
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
UNDERSTAND IN THE SCHOOL, WERE

1977
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
PEOPLE PANICKED, WERE THEY

1978
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
SCREAMING, WERE THEY RUNNING?

1979
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

1980
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
>> VERY CHAOTIC AND VERY

1981
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
EMOTIONAL PROBABLY THE BEST WAY

1982
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
TO DESCRIBE IT.
>> KIDS EMOTIONAL.

1983
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
TEACHERS EMOTIONAL.

1984
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
>> EVERYBODY WAS EMOTIONAL.

1985
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
>> WHAT WERE THEY SAYING?

1986
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
>> THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS

1987
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
PRETTY EMOTIONAL.

1988
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
IT WAS EVERYBODY.

1989

01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
REMARKS, REMARKS LIKE, WELL, WE

2167
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
SHOULD JUST ARM THE PRINCIPALS

2168
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
AND TEACHERS ARE PROBABLY NOT

2169
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
APPROPRIATE.
AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

2170
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
NEXT YEAR ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION

2171
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
ABOUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE.

2172
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
>> INCLUDED HERE TODAY, TEXAS

2173
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000

HE CAME DOWN IN FAVOR OF THE

2177
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
RIGHT TO CARRY A LEGALLY

2178
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
PURCHASED CONCEALED WEAPON

2179
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF TEXAS.

2180
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

2181
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
>> IF YOU GO THROUGH THE

2182
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
PROCESS, AND YOU HAVE BEEN

2183
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
DUALLY BACKGROUNDED AND TRAINED

2184
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
AND YOU ARE A CONCEALED HANDGUN

2185
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
LICENSED CARRYING INDIVIDUAL,

2186
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY YOUR

2187
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
HANDGUN ANYWHERE IN THIS STATE.

2188
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
>> WE'RE LEARNING TODAY THAT THE

2189
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
INVESTORS WHO OWN THE COMPANY
THAT MAKES THAT BUSHMASTER RIFLE

2190
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
USED IN CONNECTICUT, THEY WANT

2191
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
TO DUMP THEIR INVESTMENT.

2192
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
THIS IS AN UNUSUAL MOVE IN A

2193
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
HIGHLY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY WHERE

2194
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
PUBLIC OPINION RARELY AFFECTS

2195
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
BUSINESS DECISIONS.

2196
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
CHRISTINE ROMANS, LET ME BRING

2197
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
YOU IN HERE.

2198
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
AND JUST TELL ME WHY THIS -- WHY

2199
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
DOESN'T BUSHMASTER'S PARENT

2200
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
COMPANY, WHY DON'T THEY WANT TO

2201
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
OWN THIS GUNMAKER ANYMORE?

2202
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
>> THEY SAY THIS IS A WATER SHED

2203
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
EVENT AND THERE WILL BE A

2204
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THE NATION

2205
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
FEELS ABOUT THE GUNMAKERS.

2206
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS WILL

2207
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
SELL THE COMPANY.

2208
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
BUSHMASTER MANUFACTURED THAT GUN

2209
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
USED TO KILL THE TEACHERS AND

2210
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
CHILDREN IN CONNECTICUT AND NOW

2211
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
IT SAYS, IT IS APPARENT THAT THE

2212
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
SANDY HOOK TRAGEDY WAS A WATER

2213
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
SHED EVENT THAT RAISED THE

2214
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
NATIONAL DEBATE ON GUN CONTROL

2215
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
TO AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL.

2216
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
IT IS NOT OUR ROLE TO TAKE

2217
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
POSITIONS OR ATTEMPT TO SHAPE OR

2218
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
INFLUENCE THE GUN CONTROL POLICY

2219
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
DEBATE, THERE ARE, HOWEVER,

2220
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
ACTIONS THAT WE AS A FIRM CAN

2221
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
TAKE.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, BROOKE,

2222
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
MAKING GUNS AND AMMUNITION IS

2223
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
QUITE PROFITABLE.

2224
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
BUSHMASTER'S PARENT COMPANY IS A

2225
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
COLLECTION OF TEN GUN AND AMMO

2226
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
MAKERS, EARNED $232 MILLION

2227
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
PROFIT LAST YEAR.

2228
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
THESE ARE THE FASTEST GROWING

2229
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
PARTS OF THE GUN MARKET AND, BY

2230
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
THE WAY, THE RIFLES THAT

2231
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
BUSHMASTER MAKES, THEY'RE ALSO

2232
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
THE PREFERRED WEAPON OF MEXICAN

2233
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
DRUG CARTELS.

2234
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
ONE OF THE PREFERRED WEAPONS.

2235
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
IT IS RARE FOR A PRIVATE EQUITY

2236
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
TO DUMP OUT OF AN INVESTMENT

2237
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
LIKE THIS, BROOKE, BUT TODAY,

2238
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
CERBERUS IS SAYING THEY WILL

2239
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
SELL BUSHMASTER, THE PARENT

2240
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
COMPANY THAT MADE THAT GUN.

2241
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
>> THIS IS THE MILITARY-STYLE

2242
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
RIFLE, ONE OF SEVERAL THAT THE
SHOOTER HAD FRIDAY, KILLING THE

2243
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
STUDENTS, KILLING THE TEACHERS

2244
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
AND IN A TWIST HERE, IT TURNS

2245
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
OUT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS,

2246
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
THEY'RE INVESTORS IN BUSHMASTER,

2247
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2248
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
IT IS TRUE.
THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS

2249
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
RETIREMENT SYSTEM INVESTED

2250
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CERBERUS.

2251
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
CERBERUS FORMED FREEDOM GROUP,

2252
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
THE GROUP OF TEN COMPANIES

INCLUDING BUSHMASTER, OTHER AMMO

2254
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
AND ACCESSORYMAKERS TOO, VEST

2255
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
MAKERS, THAT MEANS LOOK AT THE

2256
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
FLOW OF MONEY.
THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

2257
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
RETIREMENT FUND OWN 2ZS 2.4% OFE

2258
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
FREEDOM GROUP.

2259
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
THEY'RE REVIEWING THAT

2260
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
INVESTMENT, CALIFORNIA IS
REVIEWING THAT INVESTMENT, THE

2261
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
CALIFORNIA TREASURER WANTS TO
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO PUBLIC

2262
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
SECTOR WORKERS MONEY THAT IS

2263
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
SITTING THERE IN INVESTMENTS IN

2264
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
GUNS.

2265
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
BUT, CLEARLY, THE OPTICS OF A

2266
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
TEACHERS RETIREMENT FUND

2267
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
INVESTING IN A COMPANY THAT

2268
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
MAKES A PRODUCT THAT WAS USED TO

2269
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
KILL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, THE

2270
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
OPTICS ARE PRETTY DIFFICULT.

2271
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
WE'RE ALSO TOLD RIGHT NOW AS

2272
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000

OFF THEIR WEBSITES AS WELL.

2286
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000

CLOSEST TO NEWTOWN WHERE YOU

THE RETAILER SAYS WHAT THIS IS

2301
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
IS A SHOW OF RESPECT DURING THIS

2302
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000

01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000

RETAILERS WANTING TO DISTANCE

WE'RE SEEING SEVERAL SHARES

2331
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
FALLING.

2332
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
GUN STOCKS.

2333
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
ANYWHERE FROM 8% TO 10%.

2334
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
THE BIG WORRY HERE IS THAT NOT

ONLY WILL YOU SEE BIG

2336
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
REGULATIONS GO ON GUNS, BUT

2337
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
PEOPLE WILL START TO SHY AWAY

2338
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
FROM BUYING THEM AS WELL.

2339
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
AS FAR AS INVESTORS FEEL AS FAR

2340
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
AS BECAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY THAT

2341
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
HAPPENED.

2342
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
YOU LOOK AT SMITH & WESSON,

2343
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
STURM RUGER & COMPANY, THE

TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THE LAST FIVE DAYS WERE VERY

2399
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
DIFFICULT.
WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE OUT.

WE APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP.

AND BUNCH OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

2408
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
FIRST, WHEN DID ENGEL AND HIS

2409
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
TEAM GO MISSING AND DO WE KNOW

2410
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
WHO HIS KIDNAPPERS WERE?

2411
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
>> WE HEARD FROM HIM DIRECTLY A

2412
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
FEW HOURS AGO.

2413
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
HE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO SPEAK

2414
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
LIVE WITH HIS COLLEAGUES IN NEW

2415
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
YORK ON THE "TODAY" SHOW.

2416
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
WE GOT A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED

2417
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
TO HIM, WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN

2418
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
EXTREMELY TERRIFYING ORDEAL FOR

2419
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
THEM.

2420
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
THEY WERE IN NORTHWESTERN SYRIA,

2421
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
TRAVELING WITH REBELS.

2422
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
AT ONE POINT MORE THAN A DOZEN

2423
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
ARMED GUNMEN, RICHARD ENGEL,

2424
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
SAID AMBUSHED THEM AND TOOK THEM

2425
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
INTO CUSTODY, THREW THEM IN THE

2426
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK AND DROVE

2427
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
THEM TO A LOCATION.

2428
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
THEY WERE BLINDFOLDED.

2429
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
THEY WERE BOUND FOR SEVERAL

2430
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
DAYS.
THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO MOCK

2431
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
EXECUTIONS.
THEY WENT THROUGH REALLY A

2432
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
TERRIBLE TIME.

2433
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
AND THIS IS PART OF WHAT RICHARD

2434
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
TOLD HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE

2435
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
"TODAY" SHOW, A FEW HOURS AGO,

2436
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
ABOUT WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH
WHILE THEY WERE IN CAPTIVITY.

2437
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
LET'S LISTEN.

2438
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
>> AND THEY TOOK US TO A SERIES

2439
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
OF SAFE HOUSES AND INTERROGATION

2440
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
PLACES.

2441
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
AND THEY KEPT US BLINDFOLDED,

2442
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
BOUND.

2443
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
WE WEREN'T PHYSICALLY BEATEN OR

2444
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
TORTURED.

2445
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
IT WAS A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

2446
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
TORTURE.

2447
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
THREATS OF BEING KILLED.

2448
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
THEY MADE US CHOOSE WHICH ONE OF

2449
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
US WOULD BE SHOT FIRST.

2450
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
WHEN WE REFUSED, THERE WERE MOCK

2451
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
SHOOTINGS.
THEY PRETENDED TO SHOOT GHAZI

2452
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
SEVERAL TIMES.

2453
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
WHEN YOU'RE BLINDFOLDED, AND

2454
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
THEN THEY FIRED THE GUN UP IN

2455
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
THE AIR.

2456
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
IT CAN BE VERY TRAUMATIC

2457
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
EXPERIENCE.
AND AT END OF THIS, WE WERE

2458
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
BEING MOVED TO YET ANOTHER

2459
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
LOCATION IN THE -- AROUND 11:00

2460
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
LAST NIGHT LOCAL TIME.

2461
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
AND AS WE WERE MOVING ALONG THE

2462
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
ROAD, THE KIDNAPPERS CAME ACROSS

2463
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
A REBEL CHECKPOINT.

2464
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
SOMETHING THEY HADN'T EXPECTED.

2465
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
AND SO WE WERE IN THE BACK OF,

2466
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
LIKE, WHEN YOU THINK OF AS A

2467
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
MINIVAN, AND AS WE WERE DRIVING

2468
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
ALONG THE ROAD, THE KIDNAPPERS

2469
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
SAW THIS CHECKPOINT, STARTED A

2470
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
GUNFIGHT WITH IT, TWO OF THE

2471
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
KIDNAPPERS WERE KILLED, WE

2472
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
CLIMBED OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND

2473
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
THE REBELS TOOK US.

2474
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
WE SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THEM.

2475
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
WE DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

2476
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
>> WELL, BROOKE, YOU HEARD IT

2477
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
THERE.
ESSENTIALLY THEY WERE -- THEY

2478
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
WERE RESCUED BY REBELS, CLOSE TO

2479
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME.

2480
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLY LUCKY

2481
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
ESCAPE.
LET'S BE HONEST HERE.

2482
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
IT COULD HAVE GONE HORRIBLY

2483
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
WRONG, A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS,

2484
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
HELD CAPTIVE, KIDNAPPED, IN A

2485
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
HOUSE, TRANSPORTED TO A SECOND

2486
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
LOCATION.
AT THAT POINT, RUNNING INTO A

2487
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
REBEL CHECKPOINT COMPLETELY BY

2488
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
ACCIDENT.
AND GETTING INTO A GUNFIGHT

2489
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
WHERE TWO OF THE KIDNAPPERS ARE

2490
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
KILLED AND YET RICHARD ENGEL AND

2491
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
HIS CREW ARE ABLE TO GET OUT.

2492
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I WANT TO TELL OUR VIEWERS ABOUT

2493
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
WHO RICHARD SAYS HE BELIEVES

2494
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
WERE HIS KIDNAPPERS.

2495
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
BECAUSE FOR SEVERAL DAYS,

2496
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
BROOKE, WE THOUGHT ESSENTIALLY

2497
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
PERHAPS IT WAS A REBEL UNIT, A

2498
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
JIHADI UNIIT.

2499
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
HE BELIE

2500
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
HE BELIEVES IT IS THE PRO

2501
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
GOVERNMENT MILITIA, WHO ARE

2502
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
REALLY MAKING NO SECRET OF THEIR

2503
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
SYMPATHY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF

2504
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
BASHAR AL ASSAD.

2505
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER LAYER OF

2506
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
DANGER TO REPORTING OUT OF THAT

2507
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
COUNTRY.
>> JUST TO BE BLINDFOLDED, TO

2508
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
THINK YOU'RE BEING EXECUTED

2509
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
MULTIPLE TIMES AND NOT

2510
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
HAPPENING, THEY ESCAPE.

2511
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
IT IS A TERRIFYING ORDEAL AND

2512
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
UNDERSCORES THAT REALLY, YOU

2513
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
KNOW, THESE CORRESPONDENTS AND

2514
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
THE CREW S AND RADIO AND TV AND

2515
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
THE WRITERS, EVERYONE RISKING

2516
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
THEIR LIVES TO GET INTO SYRIA TO

2517
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
TELL THE STORY OF THE SYRIANS

2518
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
BEING SLAUGHTERED MONTH AFTER

2519
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
MONTH.
>> AND THERE ARE MORE IN

2520
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
CAPTIVITY AND ORDINARY SEERIANS

2521
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
BEING SUBJECTED TO KIDNAPPINGS

2522
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
FOR RANSOM.

2523
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
THE SITUATION IS DETERIORATING

2524
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
RAPIDLY.

2525
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
>> HALA GORANI, THANK YOU SO

2526
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
MUCH.

2527
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
WE'LL STAY ON IT AND WATCH WHAT

2528
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
HAPPENS IN SYRIA.

2529
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
>>> ONE MAN ACROSS THE UNITED

2530
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
STATES FOUND A UNIQUE WAY TO

2531
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
HONOR THE VICTIMS IN NEWTOWN.

2532
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
YOU'LL MEET HIM NEXT.

2533
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

2534
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh...there you go.

2535
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

2536
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I'm gonna stand
up to her!

2537
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
No you're not.

2538
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I know.

2539
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You know Ronny folks who save
hundreds of dollars

2540
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

2541
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

2542
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Happier than a witch in
a broom factory.

2543
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

2544
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

2545
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
TO THE BEST VACATION
SP(ALL) THE GULF!

2546
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH OF
OUR GREAT STATES FOLKS VISIT.

2547
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
MISSISSIPPI,

2548
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
ALABAMA,

2549
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
LOUISIANA

2550
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
OR FLORIDA,

2551
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

2552
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
SHAUL, YOUR ALABAMA
HOSPITALITY IS INCREDIBLE.

2553
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
THANKS, KAREN.

2554
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
LOVE YOUR MISSISSIPPI OUTDOORS.

2555
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I VOTE FOR YOUR
FLORIDA BEACHES, DAWN.

2556
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
BILL, THIS LOUISIANA
SEAFOOD IS DELICIOUS.

2557
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
WE'RE HAVING SUCH A
GREAT YEAR ON THE GULF,

2558
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT
ASIDE OUR RIVALRY.

2559
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO
VISIT ANYONE OF OUR STATES.

2560
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

2561
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

2562
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE
AND WILDLIFE TO PHOTOGRAPH.

2563
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
AND THERE'S WORLD CLASS DINING
WITH OUR WORLD FAMOUS SEAFOOD.

2564
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
SO FOR A GREAT VACATION
THIS YEAR, COME TO THE GULF.

2565
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
ITS ALL FABULOUS BUT
I GIVE FLORIDA THE EDGE.

2566
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
RIGHT AFTER MISSISSIPPI.

2567
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
YOU MEAN ALABAMA.

2568
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
SAY LOUISIANA OR
THERE'S NO DESSERT.

2569
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
THIS INVITATION IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY BP

2570
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
AND ALL OF US WHO
CALL THE GULF HOME.

2571
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
>>> "THE SITUATION ROOM" WITH

2572
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
WOLF BLITZER COMING UP AT THE

2573
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
TOP OF THE HOUR.

2574
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
>> I WENT OVER TO THE

2575
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

2576
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
HEADQUARTERS 45 MINUTES OR SO,

2577
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
ARRIVED FROM WHERE WE ARE HERE

2578
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
IN NEWTOWN.

2579
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO

2580
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE.

2581
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
HE'S BECOME THE FACE OF THIS

2582
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
INVESTIGATION.
HE'S BEEN DOING DAILY BRIEFINGS.

2583
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
DOESN'T DO THEM ANYMORE, HE

2584
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
WANTS TO HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT.

2585
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I DID GO TO HIS OFFICE.

2586
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
WE HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN IN

2587
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
HIS OFFICE, TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

2588
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
GOING ON.

2589
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I ASKED HIM SOME SENSITIVE

2590
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
QUESTIONS, WE WALKED AROUND A

2591
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
LITTLE BIT, CONTINUED THE

2592
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
CONVERSATION, HOW THIS IS

2593
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
AFFECTING HIM PERSONALLY.

2594
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
LISTEN TO THIS ONE EXCHANGE.

2595
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
WAS THERE ONE MOMENT THAT STANDS

2596
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
OUT IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU'LL

2597
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
NEVER FORGET THE REST OF YOUR

2598
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
LIFE?
>> I THINK THE CRIME SCENE

2599
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

2600
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK IN ALL OF

2601
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
OUR MINDS.

2602
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL

2603
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET.

2604
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
>> SOUNDS LIKE IT IS WEIGHING ON

2605
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
HIM.
>> THAT CRIME SCENE.

2606
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
WHEN HE WENT INTO THAT SCHOOL,

2607
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND SAW

2608
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
WHAT HAD HAPPENED, MOMENTS AFTER

2609
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
IT OCCURRED, AND HE SAW THOSE

2610
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
BODIES OF THE YOUNG KIDS, SAW

2611
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
THE TEACHERS, HE SAYS IN ALL OF

2612
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
THE 39 YEARS HE'S BEEN A POLICE

2613
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
OFFICER, LAW ENFORCEMENT, STATE

2614
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
TROOPER, HE'S NEVER SEEN

2615
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND IT WILL

2616
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
WEIGH WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF

2617
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
HIS LIFE.

2618
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
LIKE EVERYONE.
HE'S BEEN MOVED.

2619
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
AND HE ALSO TOLD ME SOMETHING I

2620
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
DIDN'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

2621
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
KNEW THIS, BUT THE CONNECTICUT

2622
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
STATE POLICE, THEY ASSIGNED A

2623
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
TROOPER, ONE TROOPER TO EACH

2624
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
FAMILY OF THE 26, SO THAT THAT

2625
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
TROOPER WILL PROVIDE

2626
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
INFORMATION, FOLKS WON'T HAVE TO

2627
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
LEARN SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM

2628
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
THE MEDIA, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'LL

2629
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
BE BRIEFED AND THEY'LL HAVE A

2630
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

2631
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE

2632
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
IMPORTANT, LOOK, YOU'LL NEVER

2633
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
GET OVER THIS IF YOU'RE A

2634
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
SURVIVING FAMILY OF WHAT

2635
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
HAPPENED, BUT THEY'RE DOING THE

2636
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
BEST THEY CAN.
>> I WAS TELLING KATE, LISTEN,

2637
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
THE FAMILIES ARE JUST DEALING

2638
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
WITH TREMENDOUS PAIN RIGHT NOW.

2639
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
AND JOURNALISTS, PEOPLE COVERING

2640
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
IT, THE RESCUE WORKERS, WE'RE

2641
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
NOT DEALING WITH ANYTHING LIKE

2642
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
THAT.

2643
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
BUT JUST LIKE TO BE TRANSPARENT

2644
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
IN ALL HONESTY, YOU WERE KIND

2645
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
ENOUGH, BECAUSE YOU KNEW LAST

2646
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
NIGHT THAT WE WERE ALL AFFECTED

2647
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
BY THIS AND YOU TOOK A BUNCH OF

2648
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
US OUT TO DINNER LAST NIGHT TO

2649
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
GIVE US A BRIEF MOMENT TO TALK

2650
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
ABOUT IT AND TO SIT DOWN WITH

2651
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
EACH OTHER AND COMMUNE AND THAT

2652
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
REALLY HELPED, JUST TALKING

2653
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
ABOUT IT.
>> IT HAS BEEN TOUGH ON NOT ONLY

2654
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
THE FOLKS HERE AND THIS

2655
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE COMMUNITY, BUT

2656
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
TOUGH ON EVERYBODY.

2657
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, OBVIOUSLY THE

2658
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
FAMILIES, TOUGHEST ON THEM.

2659
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO THINK

2660
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

2661
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN AFFECTED.

2662
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
ALL OF US WILL BE AFFECTED THE

2663
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
REST OF OUR LIVES BY WHAT WE

2664
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
HAVE SEEN.
>> YOU'VE BEEN IN WAR ZONES

2665
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
BEFORE.
I'VE COVERED SOME REALLY

2666
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
HORRIFIC STORIES.

2667
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
NATURAL DISASTERS, WHATEVER.

2668
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT 20

2669
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
LITTLE, REALLY BABIES, KIDS, HOW

2670
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
DOES THAT --

2671
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
>> YOU SEE THE LITTLE PICTURES

2672
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
OF THOSE KIDS, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

2673
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
EVEN LOOK ANYMORE.
IT IS SO HARD.

2674
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
>> A SCHOOL BUS WENT BY AND WE

2675
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
SAW KIDS ON IT AND ONE OF THE

2676
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
KIDS IN THE FRONT CRYING, JUST A

2677
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
MOMENT AGO, AND AS A SCHOOL BUS

2678
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
IS GOING BY, THE MOVING TRUCKS

2679
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
WITH THEIR THINGS TO TAKE TO THE

2680
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
OTHER SCHOOL GOING IN THE

2681
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
OPPOSITE DIRECTION, AND SAME

2682
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
THING WITH THE FUNERAL

2683
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
PROCESSION, MOVING TRUCKS GOING

2684
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
BY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

2685
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
>> LITTLE WHITE COFFINS, YOU

2686
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
KNOW, THAT ARE BURYING THESE

2687
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
KIDS.
IT IS AWFUL.
>> IT IS.

2688
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
>> BROOKE, WE'LL TOSS IT BACK TO

2689
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
YOU.
YOU SAW SOME OF IT, THE FIRST

2690
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
TWO FUNERALS WERE YESTERDAY AND

2691
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
YOU WERE HERE FOR THAT AS WELL.

2692
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
YOU SAW SOME OF THE PROCESSIONS.

2693
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO

2694
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
DESCRIBE IT, HORRIFIC, HEART

2695
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
BREAKING.

2696
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
>> IT IS.
NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE YOU TWO

2697
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000

2699
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
HAD BEEN A FIREFIGHTER WITH

SANDY HOOK SINCE HIGH SKOOCH.

2701
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I STARTED TALKING TO THEM.

2702
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
THEY HAD BOX AFTER BOX AFTER BOX

2703
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
THEY WERE OPENING.

2704
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
INSIDE ALL THESE BOXES, THESE

2705
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
CARDBOARD BOXES WERE WREATHS.

2706
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000

2707
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
FIREHOUSE IN SANDY HOOK, BY A

2708
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
STRANGER.

2709
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WREATHS?

2710
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
JUST PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW,

2711
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
SENDING YOU ALL THESE WREATHS TO

2712
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
PUT UP IN YOUR TOWN?

2713
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE

2714
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
OF PORTLAND, OREGON?

2715
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
>> THANK YOU.

2716
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000

01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
PEOPLE THAT FAR AWAY CARE ABOUT
US.

2719
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
>> WREATHS SENT ALL THE WAY FROM

2720
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
OREGON.

2721
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
SO WE ACTUALLY WENT BACK TO

2722
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
THOSE BOXES THERE, AND THE TOWN

2723
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
SQUARE, JUST TO SEE WHO WAS THE

2724
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
KIND SOUL TO SEND THEM.

2725
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
AND WE FOUND HIM.
HE IS LARRY TWOFIL JOINING ME ON

2726
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
THE PHONE.

2727
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
HE OWNS TWOFIL FARM IN OREGON.

2728
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
LARRY, WHY DID YOU DO IT?

2729
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
>> IT WASN'T JUST ME.

2730
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
IT WAS OUR FAMILY, EMPLOYEES, A

2731
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
GROUP OF US GOT TOGETHER ON

2732
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000

01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000

2735
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
DESCRIBE THIS.

2736
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
AND WE JUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO

2737
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE WERE

2738
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
HURTING AND WE KNEW THAT THERE

2739
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
WAS PEOPLE HURTING THERE.

2740
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
AND WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

2741
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE

2742
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS THAT WE

2743
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
CARED.
AND OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN MAKING

2744
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
WREATHS FOR OVER 100 YEARS.

2745
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
IT IS SOMETHING WE DO, SOMETHING

2746
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT.

2747
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
AND WE FELT THERE WAS A DIRE
NEED TO DO THIS.

2748
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
SO WE GOT TOGETHER AS A FAMILY,

2749
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
AS A COMPANY, FIRST THING

2750
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
SATURDAY MORNING WE WENT TO WORK

01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
ON THIS LITTLE PROJECT AND GOT

2752
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
IT DONE.

2753
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
>> DO YOU HAVE FIREFIGHTERS IN

2754
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
YOUR FAMILY?
HE TOLD ME THAT BASICALLY, YOU

2755
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000

2756
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
FROM U.P.S. OF ALL THESE

2757
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
WREATHS.
WHAT SPECIFICALLY WAS IT OR

2758
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING?

2759
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
PERHAPS IT WAS SIMPLY THE STORY

2760
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
THAT TOUCHED YOU SO MUCH.

2761
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
>> WELL, IT JUST -- JUST REALLY

01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000

01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
AND THERE IT IS SO HARD TO

2767
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
DESCRIBE, HARD TO IMAGINE.
I HAVE KIDS OF MY OWN.

2768
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
OUR FAMILY ALL RAISED KIDS IN

2769
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
SCHOOLS AND JUST -- IT IS JUST

2770
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE.

2771
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
SO WE JUST WANTED TO LET PEOPLE

2772
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000

2773
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000

2774
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.

2775
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
SO THAT WAS OUR WAY OF SENDING A

2776
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
MESSAGE.

DAYS BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER.

2832
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INSISTING

2833
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
ON LETTING TAXES RISE ON THOSE

2834
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
MAKING MORE THAN $250,000 A

2835
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
YEAR.
THE TOP 2% OF EARNERS.

2836
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
BOEHNER AGREED TO LET TAXES RISE

2837
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
ON PEOPLE MAKING A MILLION OR

2838
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
MORE A YEAR AND THE PRESIDENT'S

2839
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
COUNTEROFFER, RAISE TAXES ON

2840
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
THOSE MAKING MORE THAN $400,000

2841
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
A YEAR.
FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE, THE TOP 1%

2842
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
OF EARNERS IN THE UNITED STATES

2843
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
MAKE $375,000 OR MORE A YEAR.

2844
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
>> I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

2845
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
EVERY INCOME TAX FILER IN

2846
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
AMERICA IS GOING TO PAY A HIGHER

2847
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
RATE COME JANUARY 1st UNLESS

2848
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
CONGRESS ACTS.

2849
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

2850
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
WE PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

2851
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

2852
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

2853
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE A

2854
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS.

2855
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
AND HAVE ALL OF THEIR CURRENT

2856
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
RATES EXTENDED.

2857
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
>> PLAN B IS THE IDEA THAT

2858
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
THEY'LL PUT THROUGH LEGISLATION.

2859
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
WHILE SPEAKER BOEHNER SHOULD BE

2860
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
COMMENDED FOR CONSIDERING TAX

2861
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
HIKES ON A TOKEN FEW, WHAT

2862
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
SHOULD WE MAKE OF ARGUMENTS FROM

2863
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
HIS REPUBLICAN BASE WHICH SAY

2864
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
ANY TAX HIKE ON THE RICH WILL

2865
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
HURT THE ECONOMY?

2866
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
WELL, CONSERVATIVES INSIST THAT

2867
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
ONCE TAXES ARE RAISED, THE

2868
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
WEALTHY WON'T USE THEIR

2869
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
DISPOSABLE INCOME ON SPENDING IN
A WAY THAT STIMULATES THE

2870
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
ECONOMY.

2871
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
WE ALL LOSE, THEY SAY, I'VE GOT

2872
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
NEWS FOR THEM, DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER YOU RAISE TAXES ON

2873
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
INCOMES OF A MILLION A YEAR OR

2881

I MEAN, IT'S HORRIBLE.

3053

BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NO, I

3054
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
DON'T THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO
DO WITH THEM.

3055
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000

3056

3057
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000

3058
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
SIGNIFICANT AND DANGEROUS ASPECT

3059
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
IS THE SENSE OF -- THE

3060
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
SENSATIONISM OF IT AND MOVIES
DON'T SENSATIONALIZE.

3061
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
THEY JUST TELL IT IT.
WHO SENSATIONALIZES IT?

3062
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
THE MEDIA?

3063
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:07,000
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM

3064
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
SEPARATELY AND NOT MUDDLE IT ALL

3065
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000

I'm breathing better.

So now I can be in

3151

ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

3152
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
significantly improve

3153
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
lung function.

3154
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

3155
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

3156
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

3157
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

3158
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

3159

for sudden symptoms

3160
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000

than twice a day.

People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

3163
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

and some eye problems.

3165
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

3166
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

3167

If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

3168
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000

ADVAIR could help
