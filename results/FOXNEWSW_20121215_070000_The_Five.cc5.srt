WHAT IS THE LATEST THAT YOU

239
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000

BREAK THEY WRAPPED UP THE

POLICE TAPE AND IT IS

242
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
GENERALLY A QUIET SCENE BEHIND

243
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ME AND A VERY DIFFERENT SCENE

244
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
HERE AND PART OF THAT

245
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
CONFUSION LIKELY STEMMED FROM

246
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THE FACT THAT RYAN LANZA ID

247
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
WAS FOUND ON ADAM LANZA.

248
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
YOU MENTIONED THAT HE IS

249
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
SPEAKING WITH POLICE.

250
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
THAT IS THE CASE.

251
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED A SUSPECT

252
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
NEITHER HE OR HIS GIRL FRIEND.

253
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THEY ROLLED UP HERE EARLIER

254
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
THIS AFTERNOON AND A

255
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
RELIRADIABLE SOURCE SAID THEY

256
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
SAW POLICE SURROUNDING THE

257
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
BUILDING AND RYAN WAS HAND

258
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
CUFF TAKEN AWAY.

259
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE A

260
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
SUSPECT HOWEVER.

261
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
THERE WERE ALL THE SORTS OF

262
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
CONFLICTING REPORTS.

263
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THEY THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS

264
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
MURDERED INSIDE OF THE

265
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
APARTMENT BUILDING BEHIND ME

266
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
OR THE FATHER.
THE FATHER IS COOPERATING WITH

267
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
THE FBI AND THEY ARE REALLY

268
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
TALKING TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS,

269
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WE ARE LEARNING THAT ADAM

270
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
LANZA LIKELY HAD SOME FORM OF

271
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
AUTISM AND A PERMANENT

272
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
DISORDER.

273
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
BACK TO YOU.
>>> IS IT TRUE THAT RYAN HAD

274
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
NOT SPOKEN WITH ADAM IN TWO

275
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
YEARS,?

276
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
>>> WELL, SEAN I CAN TELL YOU

277
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
WE HEARD THE REPORTS, BUWE

278
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM.

279
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
>>> THARCHING YOU.

280
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AND IN THE AFTER MATH OF

281
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
TODAY'S TRAGEDY THERE WERE

282
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
REPORTS EARLIER THIS YEAR THE

283
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

284
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
IMPLEMENTED SAFETY PROCEDURES

285
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
AND SO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT

286
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
ELSE CAN SCHOOLS DO TO PREVENT

287
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN

288
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THE FUTURE?

289
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
JOINING ME IS DIRECTOR OF SAFE

290
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
HAVENS INTERNATIONAL.

291
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I WAS PEEKING TO FRIENDS OF

292
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
MINE THAT ARE IN THE

293
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
EDUCATIONAL WORLD AND THEY ARE

294
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
VERY CLEAR, THIS SCHOOL WENT

295
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
ABOVE AND BEYOND TO GET BOO

296
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
SCHOOL, YOU HAD TO BE

297
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
IDENTIFIED, AND THEN BUZZED

298
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
IN.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IN THIS

299
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
CASE.

300
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING

301
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
RIGHT, WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT

302
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
STEP?
>>> SURE, THANKS FOR HAVING ME

303
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
ON.

304
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
AND WANT EXPRESS CONDOLENCES

305
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
TO THE COMMUNITY AND FAMILY.

306
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I AM HEARING A NUMBER OF

307
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
INDICATIONS OF GOOD THINGS
THAT WERE IN PLACE IN THE

308
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
SCHOOL.

309
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
BUSECURITY IS ONLY STRONG AS

310
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
YOUR WEAKEST LINK.

311
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
YOU BUZZ THEM AND SCREEN THEM,

312
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
WE ARE COMMONLIED TO TEST

313
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
SECURITY AND CAN BREACH

314
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SECURITY AND WE HAVE TO HAVE

315
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
GOOD TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAVE

316
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
EXCELLENT TECHNOLOGY TODAY AND

317
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
MAKE SURE WE ARE USING WHAT WE

318
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
KNOW ABOUT HOW PEOPLE CAN BE

319
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TRAINED TO DETECT SUBTLE SIGNS

320
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
OF DANGER.

321
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>>> DOES THAT MEAN.

322
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
>>> NO APPROACH IS FOOL PROOF.

323
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>>> THAT'S THE POINT.

324
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THE SON OF A TEACHER AT THE

325
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
SCHOOL WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO

326
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WOULD PROBABLY BE LET IN AND

327
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW AND THIS IS

328
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
IT A TOWN OF 27,000.

329
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WELL-TO-DO COMMUNITY.

330
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WALK IN AND GET FRISKED.

331
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
IS ANOTHER STEP THAT EVERY

332
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
COOL HAS ARMED GUARDS.

333
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THEY CAN GET IN THERE FAIRLY

334
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
EARLY.
>>> THERE ARE OTHER TECH

335
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED .

336
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
WE HAVE HAD SHOOTINGS IN THE

337
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
SCHOOLS WITH METAL DETECTORS.

338
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
THERE ARE LIMITS TO THE

339
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
TECHNIQUES.
BUTHERE ARE THINGS IN TERMS OF

340
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TRAINING OF STAFF AND PATTERN

341
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
MATCHING AND RECOGNITION AND

342
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
BASED AND STAFF IS TRAINED TO

343
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
PICK UP ON SUBTLE DIFFERENCES

344
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
WE SEE IT WHEN WE BUZZ IN THE

345
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
SCHOOLS TO TEST THEM.

346
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I HAVE BEEN STOPPED BECAUSE

347
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
THEY DETECT SOMETHING IS NOT

348
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
RIGHT TO USE ABOUT THE STORE

349
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
TORE TO GET IN.

350
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
IF THE PERSON IS NORMALLY

351
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
COMING AND GOING FROM THE

352
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
SCHOOL IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC

353
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
TO EXPECT THEY WOULD NOT BUZZ

354
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
THE SCHOOL INFORM WE'LL NOT

355
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
KNOW UNTIL THERE IS

356
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
INVESTIGATION .

357
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
A LOT OF SCHOOLS AND

358
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
ORGANIZATIONS PUT IN GOOD

359
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
TECHNOLOGY BUDON'T NECESSARILY

360
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
BACK TUP WITH GOOD TRAINING.

361
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
THE HUMAN BRAIN IS IT THE

362
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
GREATEST DEFENSE MECHANISM AND

363
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
STUR VIVAL MECHANISM KNOWN TO

COLLEAGUE I RESPECT GREATLY.

366
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
HE'S RIGHT.
IF WE PROGRAM THE BRAIN AND

367
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
TEACH PEOPLE THERE ARE A

368
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE

369
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
BEEN STOPPED THROUGH

370
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
TECHNIQUES.
BUNOTHING IS 100%.

371
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000

EVERYONE STARTED PANICKING AND

PARENTS OUT BUYING CHRISTMAS

417
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000

422
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

423
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
>>> WELL, THERE IS NOTHING YOU

424
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
CAN TELL A PARENT THAT LOST

425
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THE CHILD.
THEY NEED THEIR FRIENDS AND

426
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
FAMILY.

427
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IN OUR CASE, WE MADE CHOICES.

428
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WE MADE THE CHOICE NOT TO BE

429
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ANGRY AND BETTER BUT TO

430
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
CELEBRATE RACHEL'S LIFE AND

431
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000

A LOT OF THE ANSWERS ARE LONG

439
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000

THEY ARE NOT JUST A KNEE JERK

440
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
REACTION OR MORE LAWS AND

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
REGULATIONS .

442
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
BUT WE HAVE TO BE A KINDER

443
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
NATION AND TAKE TIME TO LISTEN

444
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000

RIGHT.

449
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MY SON CRAIG WAS IN THE

450
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
LIBRARY AND HE CAME WITHIN A

451
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000

TO RECOVER.

464
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL

465
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THIS PAIN.

466
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO

467
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
TURN THE CORNER A LITTLE BIT.

468
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
>>> HONESTLY, YOU NEVER

469
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
TOTALLY HEAL.

470
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
THERE IS ALWAYS A HOLE IN YOUR

471
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HEART WHEN YOU LOSE A CHILD.

472
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
WE HAVE CHILDREN AND GRAND

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
EMOTIONS AND THE INITIAL STING

479
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
IN THE FIRST TWO OR THREE

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
SHOOTER AND EVEN FRACTIS AND

487
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR THOSE

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
PARENT TO HEAR BUT WE CHOSE TO

489
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
FORGIVE AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
DO THAT.

491
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FORGIVENESS AND FOCUSING ON

492
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000

PEOPLE.

499
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
NAND THE SHOTTER MAY HAVE

500
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
SUFFERED FROM A PERSONALITY

501
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
DISORDER.

502
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
JOINING ME NOW ABOUT THE

503
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SHOOTER'S MENTAL CONDITION.

504
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
WE HAVE DOCTORS HERE PART OF

505
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THE FOX MEDICAL TEEM.

506
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
WE HEARD PERSONALITY DISORDER.

507
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I HEARD THE TERM AUTISM AND

508
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
ASBERGER'S SYNDROME.
OBVIOUS LOW THE KID AT THIS

509
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
AGE SHOOTING HIS MOTHER AND

510
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
GOING INTO SHOOT WITH ABANDON

511
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
ALL OF THESE KIDS.

512
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
WOULD ANY OF THOSE CONDITIONS

513
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
TELL YOU THAT CAN HAPPEN?

514
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
>>> HE IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH

515
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
REALITY.
IF HE HAD ASBERGER'S HE MAY

516
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
HAVE HAD ONGOING MELT DOWNS

517
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENT

518
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
BEHAVIOR.
IT IS POSSIBLE HE WAS ON

519
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
MEDICATION AND IT WAS NOT

520
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
WORKING AND HE DIDN'T HAVE

521
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
EMPATHY AND HAD SOCIAL

522
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PROBLEMS.

523
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN

524
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
EVERYTHING AND GIVEN THE AGE

525
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
OF 20, THAT HE BECAME PSCOTIC

526
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
AND HE HAD A DELUSIONAL SYSTEM

527
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
THAT LED TO A HEINOUS CRIME.

528
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
>>> IS IT ALWAYS A MEDICAL

529
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
CONDITION.

530
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
IF SOMEONE IS DISCONNECTED

531
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
FROM ROLIT AND NO SIM THEE OR

532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
CONSCIOUSNESS AND NO SOUL,

533
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
THERE IS HUMAN EVIL, I MEAN

534
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
SOMEBODY CAN KILL INNOCENT

535
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
CHILDREN LIKE IT SEEMS TO ME

536
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THAT IS IT EVIL.

537
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
>>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

538
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
DOCTOR'S OPINION IS ON I DON'T

539
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
LET POEM OFF OF THE HOOK AND

540
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SAY IT IS IT A MENAL

541
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
CONDITION.

542
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
IT IS AN ISSUE OF EVIL HERE AS

543
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
WELL.
>>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK >>>

544
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR.

545
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
LACK OF EMPATHY.

546
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
YOU CAN'T WALK UP TO THE CHILD

547
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
AND KILL IT AND SIGH THE CHILD

548
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
FALL TO THE GROUND OR SLUMP

549
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
OVER AND MAINTAINING ANY

550
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
EMPATHY.
WHY CAN YOU LOSE HUMAN

551
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
EMPATHY.
YOU CAN BE DELUSIONAL AND

552
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
WORKING ON A DELUSIONAL

553
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
SYSTEM.

554
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
BUT YOU COULD BE IF YOU THINK

555
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I DO THIS I SAVE THE WHOLE

556
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WORLD.
AND THAT IS ONE LEVEL.

557
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AND SURE PERSONALITY DISORDERS

558
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
CAN DO THIS AND OTHER

559
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
CONDITIONS LIKE DRUG ABUSE

560
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
COMBINED WITH EITHER A MOOD

561
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
DISORDER OR PERSONALITY OR ALL

562
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THREE.

563
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
BUT IS IT A MENTAL ILLNESS.

564
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OF COURSE IT IS.

565
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT LACK OF EMPATHY DOESN'T

566
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
COME FROM NO WHERE.

567
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
AND IN 20 YEARS SEAN I NEVER

568
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000

THROUGH HELL IN A WAY THAT

571
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
CREATES MENTAL ILLNESS.

572
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000

636
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
WENT ON THE SCHOOL RAMPAGE.

AND THAT IT IS GOING TO BE

670
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
OKAY.

671
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE LAST

00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THING WE WERE GOING TO HEAR

GOING TO DIE .

675
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS OKAY,

676
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
TEACHERS, BUT I WANTED THEM TO

677
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
KNOW I LOVED THEM AND THAT

678
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
WOULD BE ONE OF THE LAST

679
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
THINGS THEY HEARD AND NOT THE

680
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
GUN FIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

681
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000

GETTING HEALING IS MOST

698
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
IMPORTANT.

699
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO FOR THE

PROVIDE THEM WITH STRUCTURE.

704
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
STRUCTURE IS VERY COMFORTING

705
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
AND NOT OVERWHELM THEM WITH

706
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TOO MUCH INFORMATION BUT BE A

>> IT DEPENDS ON THE KID AND

711
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
THE SITUATION.
IF THEIR CHILD LOST A GOOD

712
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
FRIEND IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO

713
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
TAKE THEM TO THE FUNERAL.

714
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
IT WOULD BE OKAY.

715
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
AND THEY DON'T GET FRIGHTENED

716
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
AND IT IS OKAY TO HAVE A

717
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
BROADRANGE OF E.

718
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
- EMOTION .

719
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> I HAVE SIX CHILDREN AND

720
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
1984, WE HAD THE PALM SUNDAY

721
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
MASSCURE.
THIS MAN WENT IN A HOUSE AND

722
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
SHOT AND KILLED 10 KIDS.

723
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THEY WERE ALL SITTING AROUND

724
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
AND NO ONE RAN AWAY.

725
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
IT IS IT A FREEZE THING.

726
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
WHEN SOMEONE IS SYSTEMATICALLY

727
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
SHOOTING PEOPLE KIDS FREEZE.

728
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
IT IS LIKE THEY WERE ALL 12

729
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
AND UNDER.

730
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
SIX YORE OLD AND FIVE YORE OLD

731
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
AND THESE KIDS WERE ALL

732
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
SITTING AROUND AND ALL HAD

733
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
SHOTS.
>> YOU SAW TEMPERATURE >>

734
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
VIVID IN MY MIND AND THE FIRST

735
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
RESPONDERS I AM SURE THAT WAS

736
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
HORRIFIC.

737
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
10 DAY I SAW AND LARGEST MASS

738
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
MURDER IN NEW YORK HISTORY

739
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
BEFORE 9/11.
THAT IS BURNED IN MY BRAIN.

740
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT THIS

741
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
WAS.

742
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
HOW COME THERE WAS NO

743
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
SURVIVORS.

744
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
THIS PUNK.

745
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
PROBABLY SHOT THEM IN THE HEAD

746
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
AND IF HE SHOT BODY SHOTS, WE

747
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT MORE

748
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
SURVIVORS.

749
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
>> DOCTOR, YOU HAVE SEEN MANY.

750
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
NI DID THE AUTOPSIES ON THOSE.

751
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
>> YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT.

752
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
HOW DO YOU KIND OF, I GUESS IT

753
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
IS LIKE ANY JOB, YOU HAVE TO

754
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
FIND A WAY TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

755
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING OR YOU

756
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
DON'T SURVIVE.

757
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
>> IN A SENSE, THE DECEEDENTS

758
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
ARE OUT OF THE PAIN AND

759
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
MISERY.
IT IS IT THE PARTNERS AND

760
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
FAMILIES.
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A STATE

761
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
THAT WILL LAST A FEW DAYS

762
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
UNTIL THEY GET THEIR BABIES

763
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
BACK.

764
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THE SIVENADULTS WILL BE

765
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AUTOPSIED ESPECIALLY THE

766
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
PERPETRATOR.
BUT THE CHILDREN HAVE TO BE

767
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
EXAMINED AND THEY HAVE

768
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
DOCUMENT THE INJURIES ON THE

769
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
CHILDREN AND IF THERE ARE

770
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
BULLETS IN THE BODIES THEY

771
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HAVE TO BE REMOVED.

772
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TO MATCH IT UP TO THE WEAPONS

773
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
AND MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOT A

774
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
WEAPON THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

775
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
IT TAKES TIME.

776
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
>> IT COMES BACK.

777
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

778
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
THIS SAFE SCHOOL THING AND SEE

779
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
SOMETHING NOTIFY.

780
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
AND CALL NUMBER THERE.

781
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
AND IT IS COMING DOWN.

782
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I GET CALLS IN THE OFFICE.

783
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
SCHOOLS NOW ARING FOR OFF DUTY

784
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
COPS WITH A GUN.

785
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
LET'S BE HONEST IF A GUY HAD A

786
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
GUN, HE MIGHT HAVE KILLED SOME

787
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
PEOPLE YOU WOULD AT LEAST BE

788
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
ABLE TO LIMIT IT.

789
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

790
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
>> THAT'S WHY THEY TARGET

791
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
>> IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO

792
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
IT.

793
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
THESE ARE PRECIOUS THINGINGS.

794
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
WE'LL PAY FOR A RETIRED COP

795
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
WITH A GUN SO ONE OF THESE

796
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
PUNKS COME IN.

797
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
HE WILL NOT HAVE FREE WILL.

798
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
IF HE HAD MORE BULLETS AND

799
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
TIME, HE COULD HAVE KILLED

800
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
MORE UNTIL THOSE COPS GOT

801
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
THERE.

802
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
IT IS HORRIFIC.

803
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
>> I THINK WE ARE HEADED THERE

804
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
ESPECIALLY COPS IN NEW YORK.

805
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
>> I THINK IT IS IT GREAT.

806
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
BUT THE GOOD NEWS, KIDS ARE

807
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
RE
