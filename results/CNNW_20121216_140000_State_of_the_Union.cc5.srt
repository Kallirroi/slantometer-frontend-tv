DOWN LEADS THAT THEY HAVE

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
LOOKING INTO WHAT IS BEING TOLD

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
TO ME, DESCRIBED TO ME AS THE

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ACTIVITIES OF THE SHOOTER.
THEY'RE NOT GIVING A TIME FRAME.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLY

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS OR

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ALL OF THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER'S

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ACTIVITIES.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
MOTIVATED HIM TO CARRY OUT THIS

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OBVIOUSLY SENSELESS CRIME AND

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
HOW IT WAS THAT HE GOT HIS HANDS

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
ON THOSE GUNS THAT CAME FROM HIS

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
MOTHER'S HOME THAT WERE LEGALLY

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PURCHASED BY THE MOTHER

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
WE ALSO KNOW THEY HAVE COMPLETED

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
THE TRACES ON THOSE THREE GUNS

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT,

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THE TWO HANDGUNS AS WELL AS THE

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE CALLED THE

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
BUSHMASTER.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THE

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THEY WERE ALL FOUND IN THE

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CLASSROOM WITH THE SHOOTER AND

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THEY KNOW WHICH ONE HE USED TO

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
KILL HIMSELF AND DID NOT REVEAL

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THAT.
BACK TO TODAY'S ACTIVITIESES

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TERRITORY TO

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
COVER.

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'M TOLD THERE ARE AT LEAST 400

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
GUN DEALERS IN THIS FOUR-COUNTY

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AREA AS WELL AS 30 GUN RANGES

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
AND THEY PLAN TO MAKE CONTACT

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND THERE ARE ONLY 30 AGENTS

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
WORKING AT TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THAT VERY DIFFICULT TASK.

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
SO CANDY, THEY HAVE A LOT OF

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WORK TO DO TO GET DOWN TO THE

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
BOTTOM OF WHAT STARTED THIS,

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WHERE THOSE GUNS CAME FROM, HOW

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
HE GOT HIS HANDS ON THEM,

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WHETHER HE TRAINED ON THOSE

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WEAPONS.
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THEY'RE ASKING.

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
WIRE TRYI

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HE

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
LEFT BEGINNING BEHIND WRITTEN

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
DOWN.
SO FAR I'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
BACK TO YOU, CANDY.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
>> THANKS.

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION OF

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THIS HORRIFIC CRIME FOR US AT

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CNN, I SPOKE A SHORT WHILE AGO

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WITH CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
US HERE.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
LET ME JUST FIRST ASK YOU ABOUT

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WHAT DO WE NOW KNOW AND WHERE

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
ARE WE IN THE INVESTIGATION?

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
>> FIRST AND FOREMOST, THAT'S

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THE STATE POLICE HANDLING THAT

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
INVESTIGATION.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I THINK WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
IS MOST IMPORTANT.
WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A SINGLE

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
SHOOTER.
THAT THAT SHOOTER IS DEAD.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WE KNOW THAT HE WAS A TROUBLED

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
INDIVIDUAL AND THAT HE WENT TO

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE SCHOOL WITH A NUMBER OF

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
WEAPONS, WHICH HE USED ON HIS

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
VICTIMS AND ULTIMATELY USED ON

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
HIMSELF.

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THIS OTHER

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
STUFF WILL PLAY OUT OVER A

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PERIOD OF TIME.
I'M SURE WE'LL COME TO KNOW MORE

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
P HIM, HIS PROBLEMS AND HIS

152
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
FAMILY.
YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS MOVE ON.

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THIS INVESTIGATION WILL TELL US

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THOSE THINGS, BUT, YOU KNOW, I

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT.
>> SO TELL ME, LET ME GO BACK TO

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A COUPLE THINGS YOU JUST SAID.

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE FIRST IS THE WEAPONRY.

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
SO FAR AS YOU KNOW, WERE THESE

160
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WEAPONS LEGALLY OBTAINED BY THE

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MOTHER, WHICH WE'RE LED TO

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BELIEVE THEY WERE HER WEAPONS?

163
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
>> THE MOTHER PURCHASED THEM.

164
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THEY HAVE THE PATINA OF LEGAL

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PURCHASES.

166
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WAS

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SHE PURCHASING THEM FOR HERSELF,

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHICH IN THAT CASE IT WAS LEGAL.

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
IF SHE WAS PURCHASING THEM FOR

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, HER SON,

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEN THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THAT PURCHASE.

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> DO WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
INDICATES THAT?
>> THE OTHER THING IS THIS

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
ASSAULT WEAPON.
CONNECTICUT HAS A PRETTY AGGR  S

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AGGRESSIVE LAW PROBABLY OF THE

MOST AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO

LIMIT ACCESS TO THESE KINDS OF

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
WEAPONS.

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ABSENCE OF A

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
BRADY BILL, IN THE ABSENCE OF

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
FEDERAL LEGISLATION, PEOPLE USE

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
NOT HAPPEN IF WE HAD FEDERAL

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
LEGISLATION ON THIS ISSUE.

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THESE ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS.

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
YOU DON'T HUNT DEER WITH THESE

192
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THINGS.
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

194
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
HAVE TO RESOLVE THEIR OWN MINDS.

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WHERE SHOULD THIS LINE GET

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
DRAWN?
>> SO AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU'RE SAYING, THERE WAS A SEMI

198
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
ASSAULT WEAPON BUT NOT

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
NECESSARILY ONE BANNED BY

200
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
CONNECTICUT, WHICH HAS A STATE

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
LAW BANNING CERTAIN KINDS OF

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS?
>> THAT BEGS THE QUESTION, WAS

203
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THIS A WEAPON THAT SHOULD HAVE

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BEEN BANNED, AND BECAUSE OF HOW

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE MANUFACTURER DECIDED TO

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
DESCRIBE IT GOT AROUND THAT LAW?

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> LET ME GO BACK TO A COUPLE

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THINGS YOU SAID.
THE FIRST IS, IS THERE ANYTHING

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THAT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE SHE

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
MIGHT HAVE PURCHASED THEM FOR

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HER SON, OR IS THAT JUST HERE

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> HERE ARE THE POSSIBILITIES.

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THEY'RE LIVING TOGETHER.

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THEY'RE IN THE HOME.
HE ENDS UP WITH THE GUNS, SO

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THERE MAY BE AN EXPLANATION.

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
>> THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE OTHER ISSUE DESCRIBED HIS AS

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
TROUBLED, WHICH WE KNOW FROM

220
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WHAT HE DID.

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
IS THERE OTHER EVIDENCE AS

222
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THEY'VE GONE IN ABOUT TROUBLED

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
HOW?
>> YOU KNOW, CLEARLY, HE WAS

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
TROUBLED.

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
YOU HAVE TO BE DERANGED TO CARRY

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
OUT THIS KIND OF CRIME.

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN A POSITION

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THAT I SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

229
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SOMEONE ELSE'S FAMILY.

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THAT INFORMATION WILL COME OUT

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
IN DUE COURSE, BUT THIS WAS

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
CLEARLY A TROUBLED PERSON.

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
MENTALLY DISABLED IN SOME WAY?

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
MENTALLY DISABLED BY THE ACTS

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THAT HE COMMITTED.

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ONE DOESN'T SHOOT THEIR

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
MOTHER --

240
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> NOTHING BEHIND THAT THAT YOU

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
FIND IN THE INVESTIGATION THUS

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
FAR?

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
>> THERE ARE -- AS HAS BEEN

244
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ATTESTED TO ALREADY BY FAMILY

245
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
MEMBERS AND OTHERS IN THE

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
NEWSPAPERS, THIS WAS A TROUBLED

247
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
INDIVIDUAL.

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> OKAY.

249
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AS FAR AS THE GUNS ARE

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
CONCERNED, DO THEY COME OUT OF

251
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THE HOME?

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IS THAT WHERE THEY -- WERE THEY

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SECURED IN THE HOME?

254
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> YES, THAT'S OUR BELIEF.

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> LET ME MOVE YOU ON TO YOUR

256
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ROLE NOW.

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THERE ALWAYS COMES THIS POINT

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WHERE THE INVESTIGATION IS

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ONGOING.

260
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THIS INCREDIBLE GRIEF THESE

261
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
FAMILIES MUST BE AND ARE

262
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SUFFERING IS GOING ON.

263
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?

264
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, CANDY, I WAS WITH

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

266
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
FAMILIES FRIDAY MORNING, AND

267
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ULTIMATELY I HAD TO BREAK IT TO

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
ASSEMBLED AT THE FIREHOUSE THAT

270
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THEIR CHILDREN OR LOVED ONE IN

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THE CASE OF THE ADULTS WERE NOT

272
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
COMING HOME.

273
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AND THAT'S AN EXERCISE THAT I

274
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WILL LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MY LIFE.

276
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE

277
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PREPARED FOR, AND YOU GO ON.

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, I'M THE

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

280
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
CONNECTICUT.

281
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

282
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WE HAVE TO PICTURE PEOPLE AND

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
HELP PEOPLE RECOVER AND MOVE ON

284
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AND GET CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL

285
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE

286
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
BROADER SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY

287
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THESE CHILDREN AT THIS SCHOOL

288
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BACK TO SCHOOL -- A SCHOOL AS

289
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

290
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
>> TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD YOU

291
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
CORRECTLY.
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT INITIALLY

292
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HAD TO TELL THE FAMILIES

293
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
GATHERED IN THAT ROOM WHAT MANY

294
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
FEARED OR SINCE SOME OF THEM

295
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
MIGHT HAVE ALREADY KNOWN AT A

296
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GUT LEVEL, YOU WERE THE ONE THAT

297
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FINALIZED IT FOR THEM?
>> YES.

298
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> TELL ME P ABOUT THAT MOMENT.

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING

300
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
TO DO.

301
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THESE PARENTS HAD BEEN GATHERED

302
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS CLINGING

303
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
TO HOPE.

304
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
NEWS REPORTS WERE SWIRLING

305
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AROUND THEM OUTSIDE THE

306
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BUILDING.
SOMEONE HAD TO DECIDE HOW TO

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
HANDLE THAT SITUATION.

308
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ULTIMATELY IT FELL UPON ME TO DO

309
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THAT.

310
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN NEVER BE

311
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
PREPARED FOR THAT, TO TELL 18 OR

312
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
20 FOLKS OR ACTUALLY FAMILIES

313
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THAT THEIR LOVED ONE WOULD NOT

314
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BE RETURNING TO THEM THAT DAY OR

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
IN THE FUTURE IT IS A TOUGH

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
ASSIGNMENT.

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE

318
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SCHOOL ITSELF.
WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BUZZ-IN

319
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SYSTEM.

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AS YOU LOOK AT THAT AS A

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
GOVERNOR, KNOWING THE TIMES WE

322
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LIVE IN, THE SORTS OF THINGS

323
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THAT HAPPEN, AS FAR AS I KNOW,

324
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, WE'VE

325
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
YET TO TURN UP A HISTORY OF

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN TERMS

327
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
OF GOING TO A PSYCHIATRIST OR

328
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF, YOU KNOW,

329
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'M GOING TO GO DO A HORRIBLE

330
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THING.
WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THESE

331
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WHERE THERE'S NO KIND OF HISTORY

332
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
TO IT.

333
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SO WE KNOW THAT IF SOMEONE IS

334
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DETERMINED AND IT'S A FIRST-TIME

335
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THING THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS

336
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
CAN UP HAPPEN.
DO YOU LOOK AT SCHOOLS IN

337
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
CONNECTICUT NOW AND THINK, WE

338
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
HAVE TO DO BETTER IN SECURITY,

339
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
OR WE NEED A SECURITY PERSONNEL

340
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
AT THESE SCHOOLS?

341
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WHERE DO THE TIMES TAKE US IN

342
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
TERMS OF PROTECTING WHAT WE

343
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
ALWAYS ASSUMED WERE SACRED

344
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
GROUND, WHICH IS SCHOOLS?

345
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> WHAT WE KNOW IS HE SHOT HIS

346
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WAY INTO THE BUILDING, SO HE

347
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
PENETRATED THE BUILDING.

348
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HE WASN'T BUZZED IN.

349
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HE PENETRATED THE BUILDING BY

350
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
LITERALLY SHOOTING AN ENTRANCE

351
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
INTO THE BUILDING.

352
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THAT'S WHAT AN ASSAULT WEAPON

353
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
CAN DO FOR YOU.

354
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
YOU KNOW, WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY A

355
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
VIOLENT SOCIETY.

356
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
32,000-PLUS DEATHS AS A RESULT

357
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
OF GUNS BEING USED, 18,000 OF

358
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THOSE WERE SELF-INFLICTED.

359
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THIS IS A VIOLENT WORLD.

360
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WE ARE A PARTICULARLY VIOLENT

361
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
COUNTRY WITHIN THAT WORLD, AND

362
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO AN ACT

363
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
LIKE THIS, THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

364
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A WAY TO DO IT IF IT'S NOT IN A

365
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BUILDING, IT COULD BE OUTSIDE A

366
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
BUILDING.
>> SURE.

367
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THEN DO YOU LOOK AT SECURITY IN

368
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THAT BUILDING AND SAY, THEN WE

369
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HAVE TO HAVE WHATEVER IT COSTS,

370
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SECURITY GUARDS OR SOMETHING, AT

371
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THE DOORS OF SCHOOLS?

372
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> I READ A QUOTE THE OTHER DAY.

373
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
SCHOOLS ARE NOT VAULTS.

374
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THEY'RE NOT BANKS.

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO COME AND GO.

376
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
YOU BUILD THE BEST SYSTEM THAT

377
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
YOU CAN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

378
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
CHALLENGES ARE.

379
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SOME BUILDINGS BECAUSE OF THE

380
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SIZE OF THE STUDENT BODY ARE

381
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO LOCKDOWN.

382
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ALL OF THAT WILL BE TAKEN A LOOK

383
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
AT, JUST AS WE DID IN THE

384
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WAKEFUL COLUMBINE.

385
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC SERVICE FOR

386
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
A LONG TIME.

387
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I WAS A MAYOR THROUGH THE

388
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE

389
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
CENTER IN A NEARBY CITY WHERE WE

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
LOST A NUMBER OF OUR CITIZENS

391
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
AND HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE THROUGH

392
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A NUMBER OF THESE TYPES OF

393
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
EVENTS.
YOU ATTEMPT TO LEARN EVERY

394
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
LESSON YOU CAN FROM EACH ONE OF

395
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THESE, AND IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
TO SAY WHAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY

396
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
FROM THIS.

397
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

398
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
IN THE SENSE THAT TO THE BEST OF

399
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
MY KNOWLEDGE IN SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

400
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WE HAVEN'T HAD PEOPLE SHOOT

401
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEIR WAY INTO A BUILDING.

402
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> RIGHT.

403
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
GOVERNOR, LET ME ASK YOU JUST

404
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
EXTRAPOLATING FOR WHAT YOU'RE

405
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SAYING, YOU WANT STRICTER

406
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
FEDERAL GUN LAWS BECAUSE NO

407
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
MATTER HOW STRICT YOUR STATE LAW

408
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
IS, YOU FEEL YOU NEED AN OVERLAY

409
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
OF A FEDERAL LAW, IS THAT RIGHT?

410
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

411
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THAT WAS IN

412
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES, TO

413
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
HAVE ALLOWED THAT TO GO AWAY OR

414
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
DISSIPATE, IT'S THE STATE'S

415
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ABILITY TO ENFORCE THAT BECAUSE

416
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
GUNS MOVE ACROSS STATE LINES.

417
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
IN FACT, A LOT OF GUNS USED IN

418
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
CRIMES IN CONNECTICUT WERE

419
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
PURCHASED AT -- WE KNOW BECAUSE

420
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
WE CAN TRACK THEM.

421
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
THEY WERE PURCHASED AT GUN SHOWS

422
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
IN OTHER STATES PARTICULARLY

423
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
DOWN IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF

424
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THE UNITED STATES.

425
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THEY WORK UP COAST AND GET HERE.

426
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN THIS

427
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
SITUATION.

428
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THE BRADY BILL WAS A PIECE OF

429
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
LEGISLATION THAT MADE A LOT OF

430
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SENSE AND STILL DOES, AND ONE

431
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
CAN ONLY HOPE THAT WE'LL FIND A

432
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
WAY TO LIMIT THESE WEAPONS THAT

433
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
REALLY ONLY HAVE ONE PURPOSE.

434
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
>> GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

435
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000

436
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
>> THANK YOU.

437
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
WITH WE RETURN, WILL THE GUN

438
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
DEBATE LEAD ANYWHERE THIS TIME?

439
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'LL TALK TO THE GOVERNOR OF

440
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000

RELIEVER BY ORTHOPEDIC DOCTORS.

>>> IT'S NOT JUST A FEELING BUT

450
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
A FACT.

451
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE.

FIVE OF THE 12 DEADLIEST MASS

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SHOOTINGS IN U.S. HISTORY HAVE
HAPPENED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

454
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000

455
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
FAR TOO MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000

BE OUR OWN.

WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER, AND

467
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

468

MEANINGFUL ACTION TO PREVENT

GOVERNOR SAID STRICTER GUN LAWS

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

IN AURORA, THE GOVERNOR SAID, A

492
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
GREAT DEAL OF THAT DAMAGE WAS

493
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FROM THE LARGE MAGAZINE ON THE

494
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
AR-15 RIFLE.

495
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

496
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
DISCUSSION AND SAY, WHERE IS

497
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000

JOINING ANY NOW IS THE GOVERNOR

498
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000

499
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY.

500
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I THINK THAT THINGS ARE SO FRESH

501
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT, BUT YOU

502
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HAVE BEEN DEALING FOR SEVERAL

503
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
MONTHS WITH THE AFTERMATH OF

504
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN AURORA.

505
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I WONDER IF YOU HAVE -- IF I AM

506
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
MISINTERPRETING YOU OR

507
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
INTERPRETING YOU CORRECTLY THAT

508
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME SLIGHT

509
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
EVOLUTION ON WHAT OUGHT TO BE

510
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
DONE IN TERMS OF LAWS INVOLVING

511
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
GUNS OR AMMUNITIONS.

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> FIRST, LET ME JUST SAY THAT,

513
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THE HEART OF EVERY PERSON IN

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
COLORADO GOES OUT TO EVERY

515
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
PERSON IN CONNECTICUT.

516
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
WATCHING GOVERNOR MALLOY

517
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
NAVIGATE, AND I THINK DONE A

518
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
REMARKABLE JOB, BUT WE WOULD --

519
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
YOU KNOW, OUR HEARTS ARE

520
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
BREAKING THERE FOR THEM.

521
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY FEEL.

522
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING AND EVEN

523
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
AS THEY STRUGGLE TO PROCESS THIS

524
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WE'VE HAD THAT DISTANCE SINCE

525
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
THE SHOOTING IN AURORA.

526
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'VE REALLY TRIED TO LOOK AT

527
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT COULD

528
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND HOW

529
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
SHOULD WE BEGIN THIS

530
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
CONVERSATION?

531
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
THINGS LIKE HIGH CAPACITY

532
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
MAGAZIN

533
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
MAGAZINES CERTAINLY HAVE -- THAT

534
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

535
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
AGAIN.

536
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THE EXPANDING BACKGROUND CHECKS

537
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT GUNS DON'T END

538
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
UP IN THE WRONG PEOPLE'S HANDS.

539
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
WE HAD PLANNED A PRESS

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
CONFERENCE FOR TUESDAY WHERE WE

541
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF EFFORTS,

MORE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH

545
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, TO MAKE SURE WE

546
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
HAVE A 24-HOUR HOT LINE TT

547
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
SOMEONE CAN CALL IN IF THEY

548
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
THINK SOMEONE APPEARS UNSTABLE,

549
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND

550
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
OTHERS.

551
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
MAKE SURE WE EXPAND CAPACITY IN

552
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES

553
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
ACROSS THE STATE.

554
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
THAT WE HAVE A PLACE TO

555
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
STABILIZE PEOPLE IF THEY APPEAR

556
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
LIKE THEY'RE A THREAT TO

557
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

558
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I MEAN, THAT WHOLE PROGRAM WAS

559
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ALL IN PLACE, AND THAT'S

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SOMETHING WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY

561
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
WITHOUT GETTING INTO SOME OF THE

562
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
BATTLES OF GUN LEGALIZATION OR

563
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
GUN -- RESTRICTING ACCESS TO

564
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
GUNS IN SOME WAY.

565
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THAT DISCUSSION OF GUN SAFETY IS

566
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
GOING TO CONTINUE.

567
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
>> I THINK ALSO, GOVERNOR, THAT

568
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

569
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
SOMEONE THAT ISN'T IN A MENTAL

570
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
HEALTH SYSTEM AND A NUMBER OF

571
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
FOLKS -- YOURS WAS THE EXCEPTION

572
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
IN THE BEGINNING.

573
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE, I THINK,

574
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
PARTICULARLY IN TUCSON, HAD NOT

575
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
SOUGHT OUT ANY KIND OF MENTAL

576
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
HEALTH HELP.

577
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

578
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
CAUGHT UP IN A SYSTEM THAT

579
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
NECESSARILY WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT

580
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THAT IN THE PURCHASE OF GUNS.

581
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GUNS ARE

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
READILY AVAILABLE EVEN IF YOU

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
DON'T PURCHASE THEM LEGALLY.

584
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I THINK WE TALKED THAT TIME

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
ABOUT THE CULTURE OF GUNS AND

586
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
KIND OF THE CULTURE THAT WE LIVE

587
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
IN NOW AND THAT THERE'S VERY

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
LITTLE YOU CAN DO TO STOP A

589
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
DETERMINED PERSON.
DO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

590
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK

591
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THAT'S TRUE.

592
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T REALLY ARGUE

593
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
THOSE FACTS.

594
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS EXPAND THE

595
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
CAPACITY, YOUR FRAMEWORK WITHIN

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
A STATE OR WITHIN THE COUNTRY TO

597
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
HAVE MORE PEOPLE PAYING

598
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ATTENTION AND TRYING TO DETECT

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
FOLKS THAT ARE UNSTABLE ON THE

600
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
VERGE OF REAL TROUBLE, TRYING TO

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
CATCH THEM AT A SOONER LEVEL.

602
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
CERTAINLY THE CULTURE OF

603
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
VIOLENCE -- LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF

604
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
VIOLENCE IN OUR MEDIA, VIDEO

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
GAMES, THE DEPICTION OF THESE

606
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS AGAIN AND AGAIN,

607
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THERE MIGHT WELL BE SOME DIRECT

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO

609
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
HAVE MENTAL INSTABILITY, AND

610
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
WHEN THEY GO OVER THE EDGE THEY

611
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
TRANS THEMSELVES AND BECOME

612
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
PARTS OF THE VIDEO GAMES AND

613
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY ALL THESE

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE USED.

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
>> GOVERNOR, LET ME ASK YOU.

616
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
HAVE YOU -- FIRST OF ALL, I

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN

618
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OR COMMUNICATED WITH THE

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT.

620
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
WHAT DOES THIS TOWN, THIS STATE,

621
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
IF YOU WILL, GO THROUGH NOW?

622
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
YOUR INCIDENT HAPPENED IN JULY.

623
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
IT WAS HORRIFIC.
YOU'VE SORT OF SEEN THE

624
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
EVOLUTION OF THE MONTHS.

625
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WHAT'S NEXT, AND WHAT KIND OF

626
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR THE

627
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR?

628
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
>> WELL, I'M NOT SURE HE NEEDS

629
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
ADVICE FROM ME.

630
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WHAT I REMEMBER --
>> YOU'VE BEEN THERE.

631
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

632
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I REMEMBER THE -- HOW SURREAL IT

633
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
WAS.
IT SEEMED LIKE THIS COULDN'T BE

634
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
HAPPENING.

635
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
AS YOU TALKED TO ONE FAMILY

636
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
AFTER ANOTHER, THEY'RE ALL

637
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
DEALING WITH SOMETHING BEYOND

638
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
ANYTHING THEY COULD HAVE

639
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
IMAGINED.

640
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE WORST THING

641
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THEY WILL SEE IN THEIR LIVES,

642
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
ONE PERSON AFTER ANOTHER AFTER

643
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
ANOTHER.

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
IT DOES -- I THINK GOVERNOR

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
MALLOY IS, AGAIN, THE RIGHT

646
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
PERSON AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR

647
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
CONNECTICUT.

648
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
YOU CAN ALREADY SEE HE HAS THAT

649
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
COURAGE, BECAUSE HE HAS TO GO

650
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OUT TO FAMILIES AGAIN AND AGAIN

651
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
AND TRY TO BE THERE WITH THEM

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
AND HELP THEM GET THROUGH THIS

653
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
AND PROCESS IT.

654
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
IT IS.

655
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
IT'S JUST UNSPEAKABLY HARD.

656
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
YOU CAN'T -- THERE AREN'T WORDS.

657
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT IN

658
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
WORDS.

659
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>> YOU KNOW, AS A GOVERNOR THESE

660
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ARE CONSTITUENTS BUT NOT

661
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
NECESSARILY FAMILIES YOU KNEW,

662
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND YET, YOU'RE KIND OF PLAYING

663
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THIS KEY ROLE.

664
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SO IN THE MONTHS SINCE THE AA  R

665
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
AURORA THEATER SHOOTING, DOES

666
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
YOUR OFFICE CONTINUE TO SPEAK

667
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
AND TRY TO HELP THOSE FAMILIES

668
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AND WHAT ARE THOSE NEEDS IN

669
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
THERE?

670
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
>> WELL, IN VARYING DEGREES

671
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
CERTAINLY THERE WAS A FUND SET

672
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
UP TO TRY AND PROVIDE SUPPORT

673
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
AND RESOURCES TO THE FAMILIES OF

674
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THE VICTIMS AND TO THE WOUNDED

675
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
VICTIMS.

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
THAT PROCESS WAS CHALLENGING

677
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
ITSELF.
MONEY CAN'T REPLACE ESPECIALLY

678
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

679
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
IT'S SO INSUFFICIENT, AND YET,

680
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IT BECOMES THIS SYMBOL.

681
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WE WERE CHALLENGED AT EVERY STEP

682
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ALONG THAT WAY.

683
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
REALLY, A LOT OF THE FAMILIES

684
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
JUST NEED SOMEONE THEY CAN TALK

685
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
TO, THAT THEY CAN RELATE TO IN

686
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THOSE DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

687
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
TRAGEDY, IN A NUMBER OF CASES I

688
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
FELT LIKE I WAS PART OF THE

689
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
FAMILY.

690
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
YOU'RE BROUGHT IN IN A VERY

691
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
INTIMATE LEVEL, AND AGAIN HAVING

692
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT PEOPLE

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
ARE REVEALING THEMSELVES AND

694
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THEIR RESILIENCE.

695
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE THIS AWFUL

696
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THING AND FIND A WAY TO MAKE

697
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THEIR LIFE HE BETTER.

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE MOST

699
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
CHALLENGING TIMES THAT I'VE EVER

700
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
BEEN THROUGH.

701
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
>> HAVE YOU FOUND, GOVERNOR, AS

702
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
A FINAL QUESTION, THAT THOSE

703
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
FAMILIES OR THE PEOPLE IN AURORA

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OR THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO

705
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
PRESSURE YOU NOW MORE FOR SOME

706
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SORT OF GUN CONTROL?

707
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
DO YOU THINK THE TIME HAS COME

708
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

709
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
ALTHOUAT

710
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
LEAST HAVE THAT CONVERSATION?

711
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

712
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
TO BE DONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

713
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
IN TERMS OF A LAW BANNING

714
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES OR,

715
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
AGAIN, REINSTITUTING THE BAN ON

716
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS?

717
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR THAT,

718
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
OR AT LEAST A CONVERSATION ABOUT

719
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK THE ACCESS TO

720
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
GUNS IS GOING TO GET DISCUSSED

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
AND CERTAINLY I THINK

722
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AS

723
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
PEOPLE ARE DISCUSSING THIS.

724
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
WE ARE -- I MEAN, OUR COUNTRY IS

725
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
BASED ON THAT SECOND AMENDMENT.

726
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
IT'S BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY IT

727
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
DOES PROTECT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO

728
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
BEAR ARMS, TO HAVE GUNS.

729
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
YOU KNOW, MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT

730
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
ME HOW TO SHOOT AND CLEAN A 12

731
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
GAUGE SHOTGUN AND SHOWED ME HOW

732
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
TO HUNT, AND I'VE SHOWN MY SON.

733
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THAT TRADITION IS VERY POWERFUL

734
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY.

735
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
>> SURE.

736
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE DISCUSSIONS

737
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
AROUND ASSAULT WEAPONS AND

738
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND

739
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
WHO -- YOU KNOW, WHAT TYPE OF --

740
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SHOULD THERE BE A WAIT?

741
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IN

742
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
COLORADO IS EXPANDING THE TIME

743
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
IF SOMEONE HAS HAD A MENTAL

744
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
ILLNESS HOLD, EXPAND THE TIME

745
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THEY HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE THEY

746
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
CAN GET ACCESS TO A FIREARM.

747
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, I THINK

748
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING TO

749
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
HAPPEN, I HE MEAN, IN REAL TIME

750
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS.

751
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
>> GOVERNOR HICKENLOOPER, WE

752
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS

753
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
MORNING.

754

>> THANK YOU.

755
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
>> SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY HAD

756
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SECURITY MEASURES, BUT THEY WERE

757
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
NOT ENOUGH TO STOP A KILLER.

758
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'LL TALK WITH A MAN THAT

759
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
STUDIES SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND ASK

760
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
HIM IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN

761
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
DO TO FIND AND STOP THE NEXT

793
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

794
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE

795
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000

SO FOR A GREAT VACATION
THIS YEAR, COME TO THE GULF.

797
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
ITS ALL FABULOUS BUT
I GIVE FLORIDA THE EDGE.

798
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
RIGHT AFTER MISSISSIPPI.

799
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
YOU MEAN ALABAMA.

HAD ISSUES WITH LEARNING AND

DESCRIBED HIS AS, QUOTE,

819
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
DEFINITELY THE CAL LENG OF THE

820
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
FAMILY.
THEY SAY SHE BATTLED WITH THE

821
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000

822
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000

JOINING ME NOW WITH INSIGHT ON

824
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
PROFILING A KILLER IS FORENSIC

826
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SKAUL YIS MA HANLDY.

827
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
IT'S SO FAR OUT OF THE REALM OF

828
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
MAINSTREAM THINKING YOU DON'T

829
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK.

830
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
WHAT DRIVES THE KIND OF -- I'M

831
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ASSUMING IT'S ANGER THAT CAUSES

832
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SOMEONE WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD

833
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
TO JUST POP LIKE THIS AND DO

834
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC?

835
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
>> WELL, TYPICALLY THERE IS A

836
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
LOT OF ANGER WITH A PERSON LIKE

837
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THIS.
ON TOP OF IT, AN OBSESSION WITH

838
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
POWER OBTAINED THROUGH VIOLENCE.

839
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
THE IDEA THAT ONE CAN HAVE

840
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
OMNIPITENT POWER AND CONTROL AS

841
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE

842
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
POWERLESSNESS THEY EXPERIENCED

843
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
IN LIFE IN OTHER WAYS.

844
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THERE ARE COMMONALTIES IN THE

845
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
INDIVIDUALS.

846
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
HOPELESSNESS, DESPERATION,

847
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
USUALLY SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS,

848
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
AND OFTENTIMES USUALLY, IN FACT,

849
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS THAT ARE

850
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THERE TO BE DISCOVERED, THAT CAN

851
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
BE REPORTED.
THIS KIND OF LEAKAGE CAN ENABLE

852
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
US TO DISRUPT AN UNFOLDING

853
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
VIOLENT PATHWAY.

854
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
>> NOW, LISTENING TO SOME OF THE

855
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
WHAT THE AUNT SAID DESCRIBING

856
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
LANZA AS DEFINITELY THE

857
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
CHALLENGE OF THE FAMILY, I'M NOT

858
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
SURE I KNOW A PARENT WHO CAN'T

859
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
SAY THAT ABOUT A PARTICULAR

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
CHILD.

861
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
A CHALLENGE, HOW DO YOU KNOW

862
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
WHEN A CHALLENGE TURNS INTO A

863
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
DANGER?

864
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
WHAT ARE THOSE SIGNS?

865
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
>> THE CHALLENGE IS A VERY

866
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
GENERAL WORD, BUT WHAT WE'RE

867
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
LOOKING FOR ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

868
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
TALKING ABOUT VIOLENCE IN A WAY

869
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE

870
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
IDENTIFYING WITH OTHER SHOOTERS,

871
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
PEOPLE THAT ARE TALKING MAYBE

872
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ABOUT THEIR OWN DEMISE, PEOPLE

873
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
OVERLY INTERESTED IN OTHER

874
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED,

875
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
MASS SHOOTINGS, AND MAYBE ARE

876
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
INVOLVED WITH RELATING TO

877
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
FIREARMS WEAPONRY IN A WAY THAT

878
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IS OBVIOUSLY -- IT USUALLY IS

879
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
OBVIOUS.

880
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OBVIOUSLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

881
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
SO CHALLENGE IN THESE SITUATIONS

882
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
USUALLY DISTINGUISHES ITSELF AND

883
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
FAIRLY OBVIOUS TO AN OUTSIDER

884
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
LOOKING AT IT.

885
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
IT CREATES DISCOMFORT IN THE

886
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS REALLY

887
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
OFF AND WRONG, AND THOSE KINDS

888
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
OF SITUATIONS CAN BE REPORTED TO

889
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY CAN BE

890
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
REPORTED IT TO SCHOOL

891
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
AUTHORITIES WHO NOW ARE MORE

892
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
OFTEN CREATING THREAT ASSESSMENT

893
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
TEAMS THAT CAN LOOK AT

894
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE THEY

895
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
HAPPEN, INVESTIGATE, ASSESS, AND

896
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DISRUPT THEM.

897
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
WE'VE BEEN HAVING GREAT SUCCESS

898
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
IN MANY CASES YOU DON'T HEAR

899
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
ABOUT WHERE THIS LEAKAGE HAS

900
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
BEEN REPORTED BY PEOPLE IN

901
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
COMMUNITIES, PARENTS OF KIDS WHO

902
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
ARE CONCERNED, CLASSMATES, THE

903
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
OPPORTUNITY IS NEARLY ALWAYS

904
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THERE TO DISCOVER AND DISRUPT.

905
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THAT'S THE TAKE-AWAY MESSAGE
HERE.

906
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>> RIGHT.

907
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, AT LEAST I

908
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS YOUNG MAN

909
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
WAS 20 WAS ACTUALLY IN SCHOOL

910
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
AND THAT HE WAS SORT OF

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
DESCRIBED AS A LOANER A ELONER

912
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ALONE WITH HIS MOTHER.

913
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I CAN SEE HOW OUTSIDERS BEGAN TO

914
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
SPOT IT.

915
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
SHE'D LIVED WITH THIS CHILD FOR

916
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
20 YEARS SO SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

917
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
UNABLE TO SEE SOMETHING HAD

918
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
CHANGED?
>> MY SUSPICION IS WE DON'T KNOW

919
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
ENOUGH YET.

920
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
IF YOU HAVE A KID WITH

921
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS, THERE'S

922
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
A TENT SEE TO GET INSULATED AT

923
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
TIMES AND FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

924
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
HANDLING IT OR FEEL OVERWHELMED

925
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
AND THE NOT KNOW NECESSARILY

926
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
WHAT TO DO.
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH INFORMATION

927
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ABOUT THAT.

928
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
SUFFICE IT TO SAY, IF YOU HAVE

929
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
INDIVIDUALS UNSTABLE AND YOU
KNOW IT, IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD

930
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
IDEA TO RESTRICT THEIR ACCESS TO

931
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
FIREARMS WITHIN THEIR OWN HOME.

932
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN

933
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW IS

934
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ACCESS TO FIREARMS BY PEOPLE WHO

935
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
REALLY ARE UNSTABLE OR HAVE

936
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
VIOLENT FANTASIES.

937
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS, WE NEED TO

938
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
HAVE A BETTER METHOD OF

939
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
RESTRICTING THEIR ACCESS TO

940
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION.

941
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
>> AND, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW

942
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ENOUGH ABOUT IN YOUNG MAN TO

943
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
KNOW WHAT LED UP TO THIS.

944
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
IN GENERAL HOW DO YOU TREAT THE

945
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
KIND OF ANGER THAT DOES END

946
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
UP -- IN PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN

947
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
IT SEEMS TO ME WITH SORT OF THIS

948
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
UNBRIDLED ANGER.

949
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THERE ARE LOTS OF ANGRY YOUNG

950
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
MEN.

951
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
THEY WRITE NOVELS ABOUT THIS.

952
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
IT'S A PART OF ADOLESCENCE IN

953
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
EARLY 20s, IS IT NOT?

954
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
>> THERE CAN BE SOME OF THAT,

955
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT DO THESE

956
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
KINDS OF ACTIONS TYPICALLY

957
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IMMERSE THEMSELVES IN VIOLENT

958
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
STIMULATION, AND THEY'RE USUALLY

959
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
NOT OVERTLY ANGRY.

960
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THERE'S THESE THEMES OF ANGER

961
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THAT ARE CONVERTED INTO A

962
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
COGNITIVE OR MENTAL FANTASY OF

963
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
REVENGE THAT FINDS ITS WAY INTO

964
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT, WHAT THEIR

965
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
INTERESTED IN, AND IT TENDS TO

966
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
BECOME AN OBSESSION WITH

967
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
VIOLENCE AS BEING THE ANTIDOTE

968
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
OR THE SOLUTION TO THEIR

969
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
PROBLEMS.

970
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
SO WHERE YOU SEE ANGER, THAT'S

971
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
ONE THING.

972
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WHERE YOU SEE IT'S BEING

973
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
CONVERTED INTO AN ACTION PLAN

974
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
AND WHERE THEY START TO TAKE

975
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
STEPS TOWARDS THAT ACTION PLAN

976
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE

977
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
ALL-ENCOMPASSING SOLUTION AND

978
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
DEVELOPING INTO THAT FOR THEM,

979
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM

980
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
AND THE NEED TO STEP IN.

981
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT WHETHER

982
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000

IN A POSITION TO FURTHER

986
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
INVESTIGATE.
THERE ARE EXPERTS THAT MAKE A

987
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000

YOU SAT DOWN, ANDREW, WITH THE

PARENTS OF COLUMBINE KILLER

1105
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
DYLAN KLEBOLD.

1106
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
WHILE EVER OTHER MOTHER WAS

1107
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
PRAYING HER CHILD WAS SAFE, I

1108
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
HAD TO PRAY THAT MINE WOULD DIE

1109
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
BEFORE HE HURT ANYONE ELSE.

1110
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I SAW THE END PRODUCT OF MY

1111
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
LIFE'S WORK.
I HAD CREATED AA MONSTER.

1112
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
THIS IS FROM DYLAN'S MOTHER.

1113
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
THAT MAKES ME -- I MEAN TO PRAY

1114
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
FOR YOUR OWN SON TO DIE.

1115
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
TALKING TO THEM?

1117
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT BEFORE I

1118
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
WENT OUT THERE THAT I WOULD MEET

1119
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
THEM AND UNDERSTAND WHY.

1120
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
IN TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, WHY IS

1121
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THE QUESTION EVERYONE HAS, AND

1122
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
THE BETTER I GOT TO KNOW THEM,

1123
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
THE MORE MYSTIFIED I WAS.

1124
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
THEY'RE KIND, GOOD, ADMIRABLE

1125
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
PEOPLE.

1126
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
SO THEY HAD CREATED THIS CHILD.

1127
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I THOUGHT THAT THAT ILLNESS THA

1128
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THAT CAUSED HIM TO DO THAT WAS A

1129
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
STRANGE AND INEXPLICABLE ILLNESS

1130
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A SUDDEN

1131
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000

I LOVED YOUR BOOKS ON THAT.

1135
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I WONDER IF THAT ISN'T THE

1136
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
CONCLUSION WHEN YOU DO MEET

1137
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
THESE PARENTS AND YOU THINK,

1138
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
WAIT, THAT'S ME.

1139
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000

DID YOU COME AWAY WITH THAT?

1143
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> I DID.

1144
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
AND IT'S GIVEN ME A VERY

1145
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000

HE DO IT AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE

CHEMISTRY.

1159
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WHEN IT GETS MORE SOPHISTICATED

1160
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
WE'LL SEE IN WHAT IS GOING ON IN

1161
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

ROBBIE PARKER COMING OUT AND

1164

TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS.

1165

I WANT TO PLAY THE BRIEF CLIP OF

1166
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
WHAT HE SAID.

1167
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
>> OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

1168
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
OUT TO THEM.
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

1169
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SHOOTER.

1170
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1171
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU.

1172
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR

1173
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
FAMILY AND OUR LOVE AND OUR

1174
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
SUPPORT GOES OUT TO YOU, AS

1175
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WELL.

1176
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
>> THIS, IT WAS AN AMAZING ACT,

1177
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
IN AND OF ITSELF, JUST TO BE

1178
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
ABLE TO WALK OUT AND TALK AND

1179
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER.

1180
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
BUT DOES THAT SORT OF THING

1181
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
HELP?
HOW DID YOU FIND DYLAN'S PARENTS

1182
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
MOVED ON, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.

1183
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I KNOW THEY MOVED AWAY.

1184
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
>> NO, THEY'RE STILL LIVING

1185
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THERE.

1186
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
THEY SAID WE NEEDED TO STAY SOME

1187
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
PLACE WHERE THERE WERE PEOPLE

1188
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
WHO HAD KNOWN AND LOVED US AND

1189
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
PEOPLE WHO HAD KNOWN AND LOVED

1190
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
DYLAN AND THERE'S THE SENSE,

1191
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
SOMEHOW, THAT WE WANT TO BLAME

1192
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
PARENTS.
WE DON'T BLAME PARENTS FOR

1193
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AUTISM AND WE WANT TO BLAME

1194
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
PARENTS FOR THE COMMISSION OF

1195
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
THE CRIMES.

1196
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
FOR TOM AND SUE, WHAT WAS SO

1197
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
DIFFICULT IS THAT THEY HADN'T

1198
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
KNOWN THEIR CHILD AND WHILE ALL

1199
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED

1200
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
LOST A CHILD, I MEAN, ALL THE

1201
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
PARENTS OF THOSE PEOPLE AND THE

1202
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
KLEBOLDS LOST NOT ONLY THEIR

1203
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
CHILD, BUT THEIR UNDERSTANDING

1204
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
OF THAT CHILD.

1205
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
>> AND THEIR SENSE OF WHO THEY

1206
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
WERE.

1207
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
>> EXACTLY.
I REMEMBER SAYING TO THEM, WHAT

1208
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
WOULD YOU ASK DYLAN IF HE WAS

1209
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
HERE RIGHT NOW?

1210
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
HIS FATHER SAID, I WOULD ASK HIM

1211
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING AND HIS MOTHER

1212
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
PAUSED AND SAID I WOULD ASK HIM

1213
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
TO FORGIVE ME FOR BEING HIS

1214
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
MOTHER AND NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS

1215
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
GOING ON INSIDE HIS HEAD.

1216
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
>> YOU TALK TO FORENSIC

1217
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, THEY SAY THERE
ARE SIGNS.

1218
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
HERE PARENTS THOUGHT THEY KNEW

1219
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
THEIR CHILD AND DIDN'T SEE ANY

1220
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
SIGNS.

1221
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
>> DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS.

1222
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I THINK IN LOOKING AT THIS

1223
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
CURRENT SITUATION.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT,

1224
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
THE THING THAT MADE IT INTO HUGE

1225
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
NEWS IS THE GHASTLY UNSPEAKABLE

1226
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
AWFUL HOMICIDE, BUT IT WAS ALSO

1227
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
A SUICIDE.

1228
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

1229
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
THE PEOPLE WHO DO

1230
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
MURDER/SUICIDE, YOU HAVE TO
START WITH THE SUICIDE.

1231
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WHAT WAS IT THAT WAS SO BROKEN

1232
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
IN THEMSELVES THAT THEY WANTED

1233
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
TO DESTROY THEMSELVES AND WHY

1234
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
DID THEY NEED TO DO IT IN SUCH

1235
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
AN AGGRESSIVE, OVERPOWERING AND

1236
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
CRUEL FASHION.
AND WHILE WE'RE ALL MORE WORRIED

1237
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
ABOUT WHY DID HE SHOOT UP THAT

1238
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
SCHOOL, IF WE COULD BEGIN TO

1239
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOT HIMSELF,

1240
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TO

1241
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
GETTING SOME INSIGHT.

1242
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000

1295
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
