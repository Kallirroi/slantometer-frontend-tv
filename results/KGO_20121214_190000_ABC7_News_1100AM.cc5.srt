1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN IN THAT

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
COMMUNITY FOR SEVERAL HOURS NOW,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THIS IS A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE FEAR FOR

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE YET TO

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
REUNITE WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, DAVID,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
TIGHT-KNIT, WORKING-CLASS

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
COMMUNITY, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND THEIR MINDS.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
DIRECTLY INVOLVED YOU'RE GOING

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
TO KNOW SOMEBODY WHO WAS, YOU'RE

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
GOING TO FEEL FOR SOMEONE WHO

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
WAS.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
PAINFUL PLACE FOR PEOPLE.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
YES, THE SCENE OF THE HOSPITAL

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
IS ONE OF ABJECT GRIEF.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
NURSES KRIELG IN HALLWAYS.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
AND AS I SAID BEFORE, INKOLL

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
SABL AND HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TREAT MORE

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
PEOPLE.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
NOT ABLE TO DO MORE FOR THE

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL, THE

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
FACULTY AND THE STAFF.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
VERY, VERY PAINFUL, VERY

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
DIFFICULT PLACE TO BE.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
WE'RE EXPECTING A NEWS

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
CONFERENCE HERE IN THE NEXT HOUR

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
OR SO.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL HAVE DETAILS

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE SOME GOOD

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
NEWS, SOME GOOD NEWS TO BRING

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
YOU ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF THE

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
THREE PEOPLE WHO WERE BROUGHT

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
HERE TO THE HOSPITAL.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
>> IT WOULD BE WELCOMED ON AN

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
AFTERNOON THAT THIS IS PLAYING

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
OUT IN FRONT OF AMERICA.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IT'S 2:02.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
BREAK AND RESET FOR THE COUNTRY.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
FOR MANY OF THE VIEWERS TUNING

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
IN, AROUND 9:30, THE FIRST CALLS

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
CAME IN.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SHOOTING

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
IT TAKES 45 MINUTES TO GET THERE

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
FROM NEW YORK.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WE'RE TOLD AT THIS HOUR THAT

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THERE ARE AT LEAST 27 DEAD.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THE SHOOTER BELIEVED TO BE

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CARRYING FOUR WEAPONS.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
24 YEARS OLD.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
WAS WEARING A BULLETPROOF VEST

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL AND BEGAN

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
FIRING.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THAT SHOOTER IS DECEASED.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS MORE

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THAN ONE SHOOTER INVOLVED.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WE CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW TOO

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
EARLY TO SAY WHAT COULD HAVE

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BEEN THE MOTIVE FOR SUCH A

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
HEINOUS CRIME AND TO PUT THIS

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
INTO PERSPECTIVE, WHAT YOU'RE

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
WATCHING UNFOLD TODAY WILL BE

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THE DEADLIEST SHOOTING AT AN

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN AMERICA

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HISTORY, THE SECOND DEADLIEST

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
SHOOTING BEHIND VIRGINIA TECH,

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
AS YOU REMEMBER, WE ALL FOLLOWED

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THAT CLOSELY.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
MORE THAN A DOZEN SHOT AND
KILLED IN COLUMBINE.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
BUT TODAY, THE NUMBERS ARE

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SIMPLY STAGGERING.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AT LEAST 27 SHOT AND KILLED.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AND MANY OF THE VICTIMS ARE

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
CHILDREN.
I WAS STRUCK BY THE DESCRIPTION

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
EARLIER, SIMPLY REMINDING US OF

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WHAT WE ALL KNOW AS WE TAKE THE

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
KIDS TO SCHOOL, SCHOOLS ARE

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OFTEN MADE UP LONG HALLWAYS WITH

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
CLASSROOM DOORS.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S THE

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
ENTRANCE TO THE CLASSROOM.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUSPECT THAT

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
APPROACHES THAT CLASSROOM DOOR

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AS PERHAPS WAS THE CASE TODAY

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THERE IS JUST VERY LITTLE OTHER

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THAN ASKING THE CHILDREN TO

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
PERHAPS DIVE UNDER THEIR DESKS.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WE DO KNOW THAT PARENTS TELLING

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
US EARLIER IN OUR LIVE COVERAGE

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OF THIS INCIDENT THAT THE

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TEACHERS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
CALM IN TAKING THESE CHILDREN

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
KIDS WERE TOLD TO COVER THEIR

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
EYES.
THEY WERE ALSO TOLD TO GRAB A

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
FRIEND AND LEAVE ALL OF YOUR

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
BELONGINGS BEHIND.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
LOOK AT THIS.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THEIR FACES SAY IT ALL.

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
AND IF YOU NOTICED WHICH I

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
CERTAINLY DID EARLY, NONE OF

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THEM HAVE THEIR COATS ON AS THEY

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WALK OUT OF THAT SCHOOL AND LOOK

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
AT THOSE ADULTS IN THAT FRAME,

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
INTENT ON GETTING THOSE CHILDREN

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TO THAT NEIGHBORING FIRE HOUSE

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THERE IN SANDY HOOK.

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THERE'S A VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
JUST ADJACENT TO THAT SCHOOL AND

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THAT IS WHERE TEACHERS WERE TOLD

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN JUST AS

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SOON AS THEY COULD AND PERHAPS

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
IN A SIGN OF THE TIMES, LOT OF

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THESE PARENTS GOT A REVERSE TEXT

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ALERT ON THEIR CELL PHONES, AND

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
INITIALLY IT DIDN'T EVEN SAY THE

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
NAME OF THE SCHOOL IS WHAT MY

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
UNDERSTANDING IS FROM THE

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
REPORTING HERE TODAY.

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SO, YOU COULD ONLY IMAGINE AS

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
PARENTS WAITING TO HEAR IF IT

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WAS THEIR SCHOOL.

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THEY RECEIVED A REVERSE 911

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TEXT.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TECHNOLOGY THAT ALERTS US IF OUR

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
CHILDREN ARE IN DANGER NOW IN

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AMERICA.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THEY WERE TOLD TO GO TO THAT

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
FIRE HOUSE.

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>>> SECURITY AT SCHOOLS IN

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
AMERICA, AS YOU KNOW, IT'S

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCK UP

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THESE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AMERICA OR MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
HIGH SCHOOLS, IT WOULD SIMPLY BE

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
OVERWHELMING TO DO.
I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE,

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AS YOU WALK INTO THE FRONT DOOR,

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THEY'LL GUIDE YOU TO THE OFFICE,

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
YOU HAVE TO SIGN IN AND MANY

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SCHOOLS HAVE A PASS AND THERE

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
ARE HALL MONITORS, SOMETIMES

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
SECURITY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ONE SUSPICIOUS TO ENTER SCHOOL.

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
TO HAVE A SCHOOL IN LOCKDOWN

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AFTER INCIDENTS LIKE THIS IS

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ALMOST AN UNATTAINABLE GOAL TO

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
HAVE AND NOT ONE THAT WE HAVE IN

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AMERICA.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'M JUST GETTING WORD FROM ONE

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
OF OUR OTHER AFFILIATES WTNH,

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SPEAKING TO A 17-YEAR-OLD, HE

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
HAS A FOURTH GRADER IN THE

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THEY HAVE

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
BEEN REUNITED.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I WANTED TO TAKE A LISTEN HERE

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AND WE'LL TALK HERE ON THE
BACKSIDE.

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
>> MY WHOLE LIFE WAS MY SISTER

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WAS JUST REPLAYING THROUGH MY

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HEAD.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF, I'M

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
SORRY TO WHATEVER I DID.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IT WAS VERY TRAUMATIZINTRAUMATI.

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
TRUTHFULLY, I HAD TO BE CALMED

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
BY OTHER PEOPLE.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
OTHER PEOPLE WERE COMING UP TO

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ME, THEY WERE HUGGING ME.

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
MY MOM WAS CRYING HER EYES OUT.

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
>> NUMBERS OF STUDENTS HAVE LOST

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THEIR LIVES, WHAT DO YOU THINK

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ABOUT THIS, THIS IS HAPPENING

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
QUITE A BIT LATELY?

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
>> IT'S A GROWING TREND.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
LIKE THERE ARE CERTAIN LEN

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
YENSIES IN TERMS OF LAWYERS

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
PERMITTING THIS TO HAPPEN.

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> WE TALKED TO A PARENT

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
EARLIER, WHEN YOU AND YOUR MOM

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
GO TO THE SCHOOL TO PICK UP YOUR

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SISTER ANY GIVEN DAY, IS IT EASY

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE SCHOOL,

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
DO THEY CHECK YOUR I.D.?

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000

YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S

193
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A FAIR COMPARISON, THIS GUY CAME

HOW PEOPLE REACT TO THIS WILL

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
DEPEND ON A LOT ON THEIR AGE,

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THEIR LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT AND

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
HOW MUCH THEY'RE EXPOSED TO

QUITE TRAUMATIC.

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AGE OF

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THE CHILD AND DEAL WITH THEM.

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000

THING THAT HAPPENED, YOUR JOB AS

277
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
A PARENT IS TO KEEP THEM SAFE

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AND THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

279
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THE TEENAGERS, YOU WANT TO

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION, YOU

THINK THIS HAPPENED.

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
AND TRY TO THEM ENGAGE IN A

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
CONVERSATION, SO THEY CAN BEGIN

AS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO

321
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
UNDERSTAND THIS, THIS IS HOW

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
THEY EMPOWER THEMSELVES, WHETHER

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'M GOING TO CALL IT A COSTUME,

327
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE PLAYING A

328
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
DIFFERENT CHARACTER, THEY'RE

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
GOING IN THERE AND THEY DON'T

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
VIEW THESE CHILDREN OR THE

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
ADULTS AS HUMAN BEINGS, THEY

332
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
VIEW THEM AS THE ENEMY, AS

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRONGED THEM FOR

334
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
WHATEVER REASON AND THEY'RE

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
GOING TO SEEK REVENGE.

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS GUY CREATED

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY.

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
CHILDREN, INNOCENT CHILDREN OF

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THIS AGE AS BEING THE ENEMY?

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
>> BECAUSE, THEY DON'T LOOK AT

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
IT AS A CHILD.

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THEY LOOK AT IT AS THEY CAN TAKE

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION, AND

345
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THEY CAN START KILLING PEOPLE

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
AND THAT'S ALL THEY THINK ABOUT.

347
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

348
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ONE THING TO SHOOT 30-YEAR-OLD

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
DOCUMENT, IT'S ANOTHER THING TO

350
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
SHOOT A 7-YEAR-OLD.

351
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THEY HAVE COMPLETELY LOST THEIR

353
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
TOUCH, THEIR EMPATHY, THEIR

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
CARING FOR ANYONE.

355
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IT'S ALL ABOUT ME, IT'S ALL

356
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ABOUT ME GETTING MY FEELINGS

357
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000

358
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GONE ON

359
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
WITH THESE SHOOTERS.

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
YOU GOT SOMEBODY OLDER, MOST

361
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SCHOOLTEACHERS TEND TO BE

362
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
STUDENTS THAT GO BACK, BUT THIS

363
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
WAS AN OLDER PERSON, WAS HE

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WRONGED BY THE SCHOOL?

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ONE THING THAT THE INVESTIGATORS

366
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WILL LOOK AT, IS THERE A BIGGER

367
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AGENDA HERE?

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
>> BRAD, AS ALWAYS THE CASE, YOU

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
UNFATHOMAB

372
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
UNFATHOMABLE.

373
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
THIS IS THE SCHOOL SHOOTING THAT

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
BEGAN THIS MORNING WITH A CALL

375
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SHORTLY AFTER 9:30.

376
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THE FEAR WAS, THAT THIS WAS

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
GOING TO BE SOMETHING BIG.

378
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
HISTORIC IN FACT IN NATURE.

379
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THE WORST SHOOTING AT AN

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THIS

381
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
COUNTRY, EVER, AT LEAST 27 SHOT

382
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
AND KILLED.
WE BELIEVE MANY OF THEM ARE

383
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
CHILDREN, THE SHOOTER, AT LEAST

384
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ONE SHOOTER, THE SHOOTER INSIDE

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THE BUILDING CONFIRMED IS DEAD.

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
BRAD TRIED TO DESCRIBE WHAT

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
COULD HAPPEN IN SOMEONE'S LIFE

388
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
THAT LEAD THEM TO COMMITTING

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I WANT TO BRING IN N.J. BURKETT.

391
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WE JUST GOT WORD OF THE SCHOOL

392
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SECURITY POLICY.

393
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A LETTER WENT OUT TO ALL PARENTS

394
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT.

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
NOT LONG AGO, IN FACT, THEY

396
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
UPDATED THEIR SECURITY POLICY.

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THIS ISN'T GOING TO SOUND UNLIKE

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ANY OTHER SECURITY, EVERY

399
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
VISITOR WILL RING THE BELL.

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
VISITORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO

401
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
REPORT TO THE OFFICE AND SIGNED

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
IN.
WHICH WE PRESUMED WAS THE CASE.

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
SO OFTEN THE PROCEDURE IN

404
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT

405
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
NOW.

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
AS THAT 17-YEAR-OLD PUT IT

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MOMENTS AGO, THIS MAN WAS ARMED,

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
IT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
FOLLOW PROCEDURE, BUT WHAT'S

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
GOING TO BE FRIGHTENING FOR

411
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THESE PARENTS, THE RULES HAD

412
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
BEEN FOLLOWED AND FOR SOME TIME

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
NOW AT THIS SCHOOL.

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, DAVID.

415
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT THEIR

416
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
REACTION IS GOING TO BE AS THIS

417
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
WHOLE STORY UNFOLDS AS FACTS

418
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
COME OUT.

419
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SEVERAL HOURS LATER, WE'RE

420
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT

421
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
POLICIES WERE IN PLACE.

422
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WHAT POLICIES MAY HAVE BEEN

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
FOLLOWED.

424
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IN A LOT OF URBAN SCHOOLS IN

425
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
AMERICA, A LOT OF URBAN SCHOOLS

426
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IN AMERICA, THERE ARE METAL

427
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
DETECTORS, BUT IN A PLACE LIKE

428
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
THIS, YOU DON'T SEE THOSE METAL

429
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
DETECTORS.
YOU DON'T SEE THOSE KIND OF

430
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
SECURITY MEASURES, LOT OF THE

431
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
SECURITY MEASURES GO BACK TO

432
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THAT HORRIFIC SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

433
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
DUNBLANE, SCOTLAND, THAT

434
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
TRAUMATIZED PEOPLE THERE AND

435
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THIS WOULD BE APPEAR TO BE FROM

436
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
WHAT WE'RE HEARING AND SEEING,

437
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
DUNBLANE TIMES TWO.

438
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC.

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I DESCRIBED THE SCENE INSIDE THE

440
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
HOSPITAL, DANBURY HOSPITAL,

441
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WHERE THREE OF THE VICTIMS WERE

442
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
TAKEN.

443
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

444
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE VICTIMS.

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WE'RE HOPING TO KNOW MORE

446
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
SHORTLY.
BUT, THE SCENE INSIDE THE

447
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
HOSPITAL IS JUST ONE OF AS I

448
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
DESCRIBED IT AS ABJECT GRIEF,

449
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
NURSES CRYING IN THE HALLWAYS,

450
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
PEOPLE, EVEN PATIENTS HERE

451
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
INCOLOSABLE TRYING TO WRAP THEIR

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
MINDS AROUND THIS.

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
HOW EVIL DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO DO

454
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

455
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
>> THAT IN FACT IS THE BIG

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
QUESTION.

457
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WE'LL HAVE DAIS TO FIGURE THAT

458
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OUT.

459
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
N.J., ONE THING THAT STOPPED US

460
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
IN OUR TRACKS, YOU'RE AT DANBURY

461
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
HOSPITAL, THAT WAS THE

462
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
DESIGNATED TRIAGE CENTER FOR

463
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THIS TRAGEDY AS IT UNFOLDED

464
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
TODAY BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT

465
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THE TRAGEDY TODAY SO OFTEN, YOU

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
SEE THE GURNEYS BEING RUSHED IN

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WITH THE INJURED, THE NUMBER

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THAT YOU OFFERED, ONLY THREE

469
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL WOULD

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
SAY PERHAPS A LOT OF WHAT

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
UNFOLDED AT THAT SCHOOL.

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> WELL, WITHOUT QUESTION.

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE HERE,

474
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THE DOCTORS, THE NURSES, THE

475
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
STAFF WERE HOPING THEY WOULD BE

476
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
ABLE TO TREAT MORE PEOPLE, THEY

477
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
ONLY GOT TO TREAT THREE PEOPLE

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A DIFFERENT

479
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
SCALE, IT'S A DIFFERENT

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SITUATION, BUT IT WAS

481
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
REMINISCENT TO US THAT COVERED

482
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
9/11 OF THE SCENES OUTSIDE

483
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE

484
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES WERE

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WAITING FOR PATIENTS WHO NEVER
CAME.

486
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING

487
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HERE.
>> N.J., I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

488
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
REPORTING 24 HOURS NOW FOR

489
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
CHANNEL 7 HERE IN NEW YORK.

490
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING TIME TO

491
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
TALK WITH US.

492
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

493
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WATCHING FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE

494
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
COUNTRY, AN IDEA OF WHERE THIS

495
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SCHOOL IS, IT'S NEWTOWN,

496
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
CONNECTICUT, 60 MILES NORTHEAST

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
OF NEW YORK CITY, A 45-MINUTE

498
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
DRIVE OR AN HOUR AT THE MOST IF

499
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
TRAFFIC IS GOOD.

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
AS WE PULL OUT, YOU CAN SEE THE

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
TOWN.

502
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
THAT'S THE HOSPITAL WHERE N.J.

503
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WAS REPORTING JUST MOMENTS AGO.

504
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
NOT FAR FROM THE SCHOOL.

505
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
WHEN THE INITIAL CALL WENT OUT,

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE

507
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
TREATING A LOT OF INJURIES.

508
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
SO FAR, ONLY THREE PEOPLE HAVE

509
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL AND

510
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
WHILE YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE END

511
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
UP IN THE HOSPITAL, THE HOPE AS

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
THIS BEGAN UNFOLD, THE HOPE THAT

513
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
MANY MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL.

514
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THE NUMBER IS SIMPLY STAGGERING.

515
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
AT LEAST 27 DEAD.

516
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THAT'S THE LATEST NUMBER THAT WE

517
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
HAVE.

518
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
WE KNOW MANY OF THEM ARE

519
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
CHILDREN.

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WE KNOW PARENTS ARE ON THE

521
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
SCENE.
MOST OF THE PARENTS WHOSE

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
CHILDREN MADE IT OUT HAVE

523
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
ALREADY BEEN REUNITED.

524
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
YOU CAN SEE AN ADULT WITH THREE

525
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
CHILDREN WALKING OUT THERE.

526
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
CHILDREN HOLDING HANDS.

527
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
DOING WHAT THEY WERE TOLD AND

528
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
DOING WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

529
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
DO AT THE TIME OF THE MORNING.

530
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
SCHOOL WAS UNDER WAY.
IN THAT SMALL, PICTURESQUE TOWN.

531
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THEN THEY SAW THIS, AUTHORITIES

532
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WITH GUNS DRAWN AS THEY WENT CAR

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
TO CAR LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE.

534
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
INITIALLY LOOKING FOR ANYBODY

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
ELSE WHO WHITE HAVE BEEN

536
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
INVOLVED.
THIS IS THE SCENE.

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
AMBULANCES THERE.

538
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
AND THEY WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE

539
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
TO HELP MORE PEOPLE.

540
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
BUT AS WE KNOW NOW, THERE ARE

541
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
MANY VICTIMS INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

542
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND IT'S BELIEVED THOSE VICTIMS

543
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
INCLUDE STAFF AND STUDENTS.

544
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
PERHAPS SOME TEACHERS WHO WERE

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.

546
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AS WE DESCRIBED THE LAYOUT.

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
ON A FRIDAY MORNING, IN THEIR

548
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
CLASSROOM, USUALLY JUST ONE DOOR

549
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
IN, AND IF THAT GUNMAN, THAT

550
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
SUSPECT APPROACHED THAT DOOR,

551
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THERE IS NOT A LOT THAT A

552
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
TEACHER CAN DO ALTHOUGH TEACHERS

553
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
IN THIS SCHOOL TODAY WHO WERE

554
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ACTED WITH

555
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
BRAVERY AND WITH COURAGE AS YOU

556
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
WATCH THEM WALK OUT AND YOU

557
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
COULD SEE IT ON THEIR FACES EVEN

558
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
IN THE STILL IMAGES, CHILDREN

559
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WITHOUT THEIR COATS.

560
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THERE'S A FIRE HOUSE AROUND THE

561
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
CORNER.

562
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BROUGHT

563
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
THE CHILDREN.

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE TASK OF

565
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
GETTING 500 CHILDREN OUT OF THE

566
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SCHOOL?

567
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
NOT KNOWING IF THE INCIDENT HAD

568
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
ENDED AND IF THE SCENE WAS

569
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SECURED?

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE

571
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
THOMAS, OUR SENIOR JOS

572
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
CORRESPONDENT.
PIERRE, WE KNOW THAT VERY EARLY

573
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
ON, THE PRESIDENT WAS NOTIFIED.

574
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
JAKE TAPPER IS IN THE BRIEFING

575
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
ROOM.

576
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, TAKE US

577
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
THROUGH HOW THE PRESIDENT IS

578
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
BRIEFED, HOW QUICKLY THIS

579
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
INFORMATION IS GETTING TO HIM

580
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
AND WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF

581
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
CONNECTICUT NOW BRIEFING THE

582
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
PARENTS.

583
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
>> THE WAY THIS UNFOLDED THE

584
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
FBI, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE LOCAL

585
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,

586
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THE LOCAL FBI OFFICE WAS

587
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
NOTIFIED ABOUT THE SHOOTING,

588
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THEY SENT PERSONNEL TO THE

589
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
SCENE, THEN THAT INFORMATION

590
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
MADE ITS WAY TO THE FBI

591
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
DIRECTOR.

592
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THE FBI DIRECTOR THAN INFORMED

593
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SCALE OF

594
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
THE EVENT AND HOW HORRIFIC IT

595
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
WAS AND THAT'S HOW WE UNDERSTAND

596
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
THIS WENT DOWN.

597
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WE'RE ALSO GETTING SOME

598
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE

599
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE.

600
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT HE'S AN

601
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
IDENTIFIED AS A 24-YEAR-OLD.

602
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
WE'LL BE GATHERING MORE

603
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
INFORMATION TO GIVE TO OUR

604
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
VIEWERS AS WE GET MORE DETAIL.

605
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> PIERRE, I HAVE BEEN HANDED

606
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SOME INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN

607
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SENT OUT FOR OUR VIEWERS, WE

608
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
HAVE AN INTERNAL E-MAIL SYSTEM

609
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THAT WE BRIEF EACH OTHER AND OUR

610
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
UNIT IS TELLING US THAT THIS WAS

611
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A 24-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO OBVIOUSLY

612
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING

613
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
TO INVESTIGATE, TO DETERMINE

614
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS RELATED TO

615
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
SOME WAY TO SOMEONE IN THAT

616
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
SCHOOL.
>> I HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES

617
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
TELLING ME THAT SAME

618
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
INFORMATION.

619
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
24-YEAR-OLD HAS EMERGED AS THE

620
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
LEADING SCHT AS THE PERSON THEY

621
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
BELIEVE DID THE SHOOTING.

622
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
HE'S THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD AN

623
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE AT THE

624
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
SCHOOL.
THIS IS VERY FLUID SITUATION.

625
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THEY'RE DOING A SEARCH AT THE

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
MAN'S HOME.

627
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WE HOPE TO HAVE SOME MORE

628
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SHORTLY.

629
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>>> BRAD GARRETT A FORMER FBI

630
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
PROFILER, HE'S AN ABC NEWS

631
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
ANALYST, HE'S COMING TO OUR

632
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
WASHINGTON BUREAU TODAY, HE WAS

633
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
TRYING TO HELP US FIGURE OUT

634
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SOME REASONING WHY SOMEONE WOULD

635
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
DO THIS.

636
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WE OFTEN POINT TO ILLNESS AFTER

637
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
CASES LIKE THIS.

638
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I WAS STRUCK BY THE AGE, 24

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
YEARS OLD.

640
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
COLUMBINE, VIRGINIA TECH, THEY

641
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
WERE STUDENTS AT THOSE

642
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
PARTICULAR SCHOOLS INVOLVED.

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
BUT THIS WAS AN ELEMENTARY

644
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SCHOOL.
WHEN YOU HEAR 24 YEARS OLD, YOU

645
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IMMEDIATELY THINK, THIS IS A

646
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE

647
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
HAVE SEEN.

648
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

649
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
DAVID, AS WE TALKED ABOUT

650
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
EARLIER, WHAT'S THE CONNECTION

651
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
BETWEEN THE SHOOTER WITH THE

652
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SCHOOL?
IF THERE'S A CHILD, SHOOTER'S

653
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
CHILD, CONNECTED TO THE SHOOTER

654
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
SOME WAY, ONE QUICK SCENARIO, IF

655
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THIS INVOLVES A DOMESTIC

656
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
SITUATION, HE LOST CUSTODY OF

657
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
THIS CHILDREN, IN MURDERS OF

658
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
CHILDREN BY THE FATHERS, IT'S

659
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
MAINLY DRIVEN MANY TIMES BY

660
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
WANTING TO KILL THE MOTHER AND

661
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY

662
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
BELIEVE THE MOTHER PRODUCED THIS

663
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
CHILD AND NO ONE ELSE IS GOING

664
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
TO HAVE THIS CHILD I'M GOING TO

665
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
TAKE THIS CHILD OUT.

666
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO THAT AND

667
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
KILL AOTHER CHILDREN?

668
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THE REAL MOTIVE OF THIS, WE'RE

669
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AND GO,

670
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
HOW IN THE WORLD COULD YOU KILN

671
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
ANYBODY BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
TELLING ME?

673
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
BUT ONCE YOU REACH A POINT WHERE

674
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO RESOLVE

675
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
YOUR SITUATION, AND THE ANGER

676
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
AND RAGE ARE SO GREAT TOWARD

677
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
PERHAPS ANOTHER ADULT, PERHAPS

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
TOWARD A CHILD AT THE SCHOOL,

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THEN YOU GO INTO THIS MODE

680
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
WHERE, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER,

681
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
YOU'RE NOT KILLING HUMAN BEINGS

682
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
YOU'RE JUST INFLICTING RAGE.

683
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AND WITH THAT RAGE, YOU FEEL

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
MORE POWERFUL AT LEAST FOR THE

685
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
MOMENT AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY OF

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THESE SHOOTERS THEY SHOOT

687
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
THEMSELVES OR POLICE SHOOT THEM

688
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
AT THE END OF THE RAM PAGE.

689
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR ALL

690
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THIS ENDED.

691
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THE GUNMAN INSIDE THE SCHOOL IS

692
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
DEAD.
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CARRYING

693
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
FOUR WEAPONS.

694
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
ONE MOTHER WE TALKED TO EARLIER

695
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
DESCRIBED THE GUNMAN INSIDE THE

696
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
BUILDING AS HAVING A MASK ON AS

697
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THIS GUNMAN WENT THROUGH THE

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
BUILDING.

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
AND OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL ALSO BE

700
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE PATH THE

701
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
GUNMAN TOOK TO HELP US DETERMINE

702
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
PERHAPS WHY THIS SCHOOL, WHY

703
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THIS PARTICULARS CLASSROOM, I

704
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WANT TO CHECK IN WITH DAN

705
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
HARRIS.
WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR HOURS ON

706
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THE SCENE.

707
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
HE WAS AT THAT FIRE HOUSE WHERE

708
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THOSE REUNIONS WERE TAKING

709
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
PLACE.

710
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
DAN, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE

711
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SCENE BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR DAN

712
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
MALLOY THERE IN CONNECTICUT AND

713
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
THE PARENTS WAITING TO HEAR.

714
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
>> IT'S GOT TO BE A WRENCHING

715
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
JOB THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IN

716
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
FRONT OF HIM RIGHT NOW.

717
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
WE HAVE SEEN HIM BRIEFLY, WE SAW

718
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
HIM LEAVING THE FIRE HOUSE AND

719
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
WE SAW HIM COMING BACK.

720
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WE KNOW AS HIS SPOKESPERSON SAID

721
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
EARLIER, HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING

722
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
WITH THE PARENTS.

723
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT

724
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
NOW.

725
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
THIS IS THE VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE

726
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
RIGHT DOWN THIS STREET.

727
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

728
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
RIGHT DOWN THIS STREET IS WHERE

729
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS.

730
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE STUDENTS WERE RUSHED OUT OF

731
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE SCHOOL AND BROUGHT TO THIS

732
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
FIRE STATION.

733
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
PARENTS COMING HERE TO REUNITE

734
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

735
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT THINGS

736
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY, ONE OF

737
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THE HORRIFYING THINGS, PARENTS,

738
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
MARRIED COUPLES LEAVING HERE ARM

739
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
IN ARM WITHOUT THEIR CHILDREN.

740
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
