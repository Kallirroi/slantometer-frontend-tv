00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
OF RESETTLING THE STUDENTS AT A

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
NEW SCHOOL.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
20 LITTLE FLAGS DOT THE CURB

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
OUTSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
TEDDY BEARS, ANGELS KEEPING

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
WATCH NEAR THE CENTER OF TOWN

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
AND THE TOWN'S FLAG IN THE

CENTRAL OF MAIN STREET AT HALF

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
TREE HAS A DIFFERENT GLOW

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
SURROUNDED BY MEMORIAL CANDLES

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
AND THE LIGHTS OF THE WORLD'S

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
MEDIA.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THE RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN KNOW IT

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WILL TAKE TIME FOR THIS TOWN TO

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
HEAL BUT THEY ARE ALSO

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
DETERMINED TO SHOW THE WORLD

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THAT NEWTOWN WILL NOT JUST

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
BECOME ANOTHER WORD FOR TRAGEDY.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>> THE TOWN RIGHT NOW IS

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
MOURNING.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
>>> TONIGHT, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
STANDING UP AGAINST GUN

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
VIOLENCE.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> THIS IS THE STRAW THAT BREAKS

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
THE CAMEL'S BACK.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPOND.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
>> TO AN UNPRECEDENTED GATHERING

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
WE THOUGHT AND HOPED WOULD NEVER

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
BE REPEATED.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
TEN FAMILIES FROM THE AURORA

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
SHOOTING, THEY'RE SPEAKING OUT

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
WITH SOLIDARITY.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
PLUS, DR. ROSS TAKES US INSIDE

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THE MIND OF A KILLER.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HE WAS QUIET.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A NICE KID, A GOOD KID.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
>> HOW THIS TIME IT MAY BE

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
DIFFERENT IN CHANGING THE LAW OF

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THE LINE.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
ANYMORE.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
>> THIS IS "PIERS MORGAN

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TONIGHT."

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
>> GOOD EVENING.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
JUST A FEW MINUTES IN THE

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
STUDIO, WE'RE GOING TO DO

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH TEN

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AMERICANS WHO LIVED WHAT WE

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
HOPED MIGHT BE THE LAST MASS

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
SHOOTING IN THIS COUNTRY, THE

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
MASSACRE IN A MOVIE HEATER IN

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AURORA, COLORADO.

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
YOU NEED TO HEAR WHAT THESE

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT GUNS IN

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
AMERICA.

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
>>> BUT FIRST, A PICTURE NONE OF

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
US EVER IMAGINED OR FEARED WE

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WOULD EVER HAVE TO SEE.

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THE FIRST FUNERALS OF THE 20

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED AT THE

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
CONNECTICUT, ON FRIDAY.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
6-YEAR-OLD JACK PINTO WAS LAID

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
TO REST TODAY.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
IN HIS OBITUARY, HIS FAMILY

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
WROTE, "JACK WILL FOREVER BE

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
REMEMBERED FOR THE IMMEASURABLE

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
JOY HE BROUGHT TO ALL WHO HAD

76
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING HIM, A

77
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
JOY WHOSE WIDE REACH BELIED HIS

78
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SIX YEARS."

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
HE WAS BURIED IN THE JERSEY OF

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
HIS FAVORITE TEAM MEMBER OF THE

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
NEW YORK GIANTS.

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
HIS FAMILY SAID HE COULD GET

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WHATEVER HE WANTED JUST BY

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
BATTING HIS LONG EYELASHES.

85
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
LISTEN NOW TO WHAT MAY BE ONE OF

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THE MOST HEARTBREAKING OF ALL IN

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THIS GHASTLY TRAGEDY.

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
PARENTS TALKING ABOUT THE MOMENT

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THEY LEARNED THEIR DAUGHTER HAD

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
DIED IN THE CARNAGE AT SANDY

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
HOOK SCHOOL.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
>> SHE WAS A BALL OF FIRE.

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SHE RULED THE ROOST.

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SHE --

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
>> OUR LITTLE CEO, WE CALLED

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
HER.

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS THE BOSS.

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
>> I GOT TO THE FIREHOUSE.

99
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
>> WE HAD NO IDEA AT THIS POINT.

100
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WE THOUGHT OKAY, THE REPORTS ARE

101
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THAT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE MAY HAVE

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BEEN INJURED.

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> I WALKED AROUND THE

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
FIREHOUSE.

105
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MAYBE SHE IS IN.

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THIS MAYBE SHE IS THERE.

107
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> I MUST HAVE DONE 100 LAPS.

108
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS
WEARING.

109
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I WAS GOING TO SEE HER LITTLE

110
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
PONYTAIL COME AROUND THE CORNER

111
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
AND HER JACKET AND HER BLACK

112
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
GLITTERY UGGS THAT SHE HAD ON

113
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THAT MORNING.

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THEY FINALLY AROUND 1:15 ASKED

115
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN, AND THEY

116
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SAID THAT IT WAS A TRAGIC DAY IN

117
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
NEWTOWN TODAY, AND 20 CHILDREN

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WERE KILLED.

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AND -- TELL ME THAT MY LITTLE

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
GIRL WAS GONE.

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> THERE WAS SO MUCH PAIN AND

122
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
CONFUSION WHEN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS MADE.

123
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THE LIFE WAS JUST SUCKED OUT OF

124
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST

126
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
POINT-BLANK FOUND A STATE

127
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
TROOPER AND ARE THERE ANY

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SURVIVORS?

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT STANDING

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
HERE AS A PARENT, MY CHILD IS

131
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
GONE?

132
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
AND HE SAID YES.

133
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> THE BED SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
OUT OF.

135
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
AND WE JUST STAYED IN BED.

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IT'S STILL NOT REAL THAT MY --

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
MY LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS SO FULL

138
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OF LIFE AND WHO WANTS A HORSE SO

139
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BADLY AND WHO IS GOING TO GET

140
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
COWGIRL BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS

141
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ISN'T COMING HOME.

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
>> SO MANY AWFUL, AWFUL ACCOUNTS

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OF THIS APPALLING TRAGEDY.

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
WHAT WILL AMERICA DO ABOUT GUNS?

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
JOINING ME NOW IS SENATOR DIANNE

146
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
FEINSTEIN.

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SHE IS INTRODUCING AN ASSAULT

148
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WEAPONS BAN WHEN CONGRESS

149
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
RECONVENES IN JANUARY.

150
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
IT'S ALMOST TOO MUCH TO BEAR,

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
ISN'T IT, LISTENING?

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
>> YES, IT IS.

153
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
IT'S VERY HARD.

154
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO IF

155
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
IT WERE MY DAUGHTER.

156
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I JUST -- THIS IS SO BAD.

157
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IT IS SO HORRIFIC.

158
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
YOU KNOW, ONE POINT YOU FEEL

159
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THIS TERRIBLE GRIEF, AND THEN

160
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
YOU FEEL THIS ANGER THAT THIS

161
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
COULD HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY,

162
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHERE CHILDREN SHOULD BE AT

163
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
LEAST SAFE IN A SCHOOL.

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ANYWAY, YES, I'M GOING TO DO AN

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS PIECE OF

166
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
LEGISLATION.

167
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG, AND

168
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
IT'S GOING TO BE DEFINITIVE.

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BAN BY NAME AT

170
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
LEAST 100 MILITARY-STYLE

171
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS.

172
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BAN BIG CLIPS,

173
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DRUMS OR STRIPS OF MORE THAN TEN

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BULLETS.

175
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND IT'S THIS PARTICULAR

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
CATEGORY OF WEAPON WHICH THE

177
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
BUSHMASTER IS.

178
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
IT'S A KILLER WEAPON.

179
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
YOU CAN FIRE IT VERY QUICKLY.

180
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
IT HAS VERY LITTLE RECOIL, VERY

181
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
LITTLE KICK, AND IT'S VERY HIGH

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
VELOCITY.

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG ON THE

184
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
STREETS OF OUR CITY.

185
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG IN A PLACE

186
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WHERE A 20-YEAR-OLD LIKE THIS

187
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
PARTICULAR 20-YEAR-OLD COULD GET

188
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AHOLD OF IT AND GO IN AND DO

189
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHAT HE DID.

190
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
AND THIS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY.

191
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO

192
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SAY I HAVE MY SECOND AMENDMENT

193
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
RIGHTS.

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'M ENTITLED TO BEAR ARMS.

195
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO TAKE

196
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AWAY THAT RIGHT BY REMOVING

197
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THESE KIND OF WEAPONS FROM THE

198
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
STREETS AND FROM THE STORES.

199
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> THERE IS NO SECOND AMENDMENT

200
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
RIGHT TO BEAR EVERY TYPE OF

201
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
WEAPON THAT YOU KNOW OF.
THESE ARE A CERTAIN CLASS OF

202
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WEAPONS.

203
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THEY ARE DESIGNED TO KILL LARGE

204
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN CLOSE

205
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
COMBAT.

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THE SECOND

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AMENDMENT COVERS THEM.

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN

209
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A LONG TIME BEFORE THESE -- THIS

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
CLASS OF WEAPONS WAS FOUNDED,

211
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
MERCHANDISED, AND SPREAD ALL

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OVER OUR COUNTRY.

213
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE HANDS

214
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
OF JUVENILES, GRIEVANCE KILLERS,

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
PEOPLE WHO GO INTO OUR MALLS,

216
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
OUR THEATERS, OUR STORES, OUR

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BUSINESSES, AND NOW OUR SCHOOLS

218
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
AND JUST KILL PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD

219
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
REASON.

220
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

221
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE REACTION

222
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
YOU'VE HAD ALREADY FROM OTHER

223
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
POLITICIANS.

224
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ANY GUN

225
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SUPPORTING POLITICIAN ON THE

226
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHOW.

227
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
AND LIKE MOST SHOWS ON AMERICAN

228
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T

229
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WANT TO COME ON.

230
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THEY'RE HIDING AWAY, AS ARE

231
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
MEMBERS OF THE NRA AND ALL THE

232
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
USUAL SUSPECTS WHEN THESE

233
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.

234
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
ARE YOU DETECTING, SENATOR, THAT

235
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
THERE IS CHANGE IN MOOD?

236
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ARE YOU HOPING THIS IS A TIPPING

237
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
POINT?

238
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
>> YES, I HOPE SO, PIERS.

239
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I HAD TO DO A BRIEF SEGMENT ON

240
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
"MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY

241
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MORNING.

242
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND AFTERWARDS, I PROBABLY GOT

243
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
20 PHONE CALLS AT HOME HERE IN

244
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WASHINGTON.

245
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
VERY UNUSUAL, PEOPLE FROM

246
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA

247
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
CALLING AND SAYING WE WANT TO

248
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
HELP WITH THIS.

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

250
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I EVEN HAD ONE MAN WHO WAS A

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
MEMBER OF THE NRA WHO SAID I

252
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HAVE AN AR-15, AND I'M GOING TO

253
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
GET RID OF IT.

254
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'M A HUNTER, AND I WANT YOU TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE ASSAULT

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WEAPONS.

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SO I'M GOING TO DO MY LEVEL BEST

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TO TRY.

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE IN 1993.

259
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WE SAT DOWN AND WE WROTE A BILL,

260
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
AND THAT BILL PASSED THE SENATE.

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
CHUCK SCHUMER INTRODUCED IT IN

262
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THE HOUSE.

263
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
IT PASSED.

264
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
IT WAS NOT AMENDED.

265
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
IT WAS PASSED.

266
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AND IT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT.

267
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED IT, AND

268
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT WAS THE LAW FOR TEN YEARS.

269
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AND OVER TIME, IT BEGAN TO WIND

270
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
DOWN THE SUPPLY OF THESE

271
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
WEAPONS.

272
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND PARTICULARLY THE CLIPS,

273
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
DRUMS, OR STRIPS OF OVER 100

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
BULLETS.

275
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE

276
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
PERSON THAT WENT INTO THAT

277
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HEATER IN AURORA HAD A DRUM WITH

278
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
100 BULLETS IN HIS ASSAULT

279
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WEAPON.

280
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
FORTUNATELY, THAT DRUM JAMMED OR

281
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ELSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD 100 CLEAR

282
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SHOTS AT PEOPLE SITTING IN SEATS

283
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
IN A MOVIE THEATER.

284
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
NOW, HERE YOU PROBABLY HAD THIS

285
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
MAN FIRE MORE THAN 100 BULLETS.

286
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I MEAN, WE'VE JUST HEARD WHERE

287
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
NO CHILD HAD LESS THAN THREE

288
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
BULLETS IN THEM OF WHAT IS A

289
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
KILLER WEAPON THAT SHOULDN'T BE

290
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITY.

291
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
AND NOW THESE CHILDREN, THIS IS

292
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE

293
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
CAMEL'S BACK.

294
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPOND.

295
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
RIGHTS OF THE MANY TO REMAIN

297
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
SAFE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY

298
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
RIGHT YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE TO

299
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
HAVE A MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT
WEAPON.

300
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I APPLAUD

301
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I WISH YOU

302
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
EVERY SUCCESS.

303
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
>> THANK YOU.

304
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THANK YOU, PIERS, I APPRECIATE

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
IT.

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>>> MY NEXT GUEST IS A GUN

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
RIGHTS ADVOCATE.

308
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HE SAYS THE BUSHMASTER

309
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, THE TYPE OF

310
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
RIFLE ADAM LANZA USED TO KILL 20

311
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
CHILDREN AND SIX MORE ADULTS

312
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SAYS, QUOTE IS A BLAST TO SHOOT

313
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
WITH.

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

315
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
VIRGINIA CITIZENS DEFENSE

316
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
LEAGUE.

317
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I WANT TO READ WHAT YOU SAID ON

318
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
SUNDAY TO THE "WASHINGTON POST."

319
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
YOU SAID I COULD ASK YOU WHEN

320
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
ASKED ABOUT THE USE OF THESE

321
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
TYPE OF WEAPONS WHY SHOULD

322
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
ANYONE WANT A FERRARI?

323
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BUSHMASTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY A

324
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
BLAST TO SHOOT WITH.

325
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THEY'RE FAST.

326
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THEY'RE ACCURATE.

327
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
GUNS ARE FUN.

328
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SOME OF THEM ARE MUCH MORE COOL

329
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
THAN OTHERS.

330
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
IT'S JUST LIKE WE HAVE

331
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
TELEVISION SETS THAT LOOK COOL

332
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
AND OTHERS ARE MUCH MORE BOXY.

333
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ARE YOU PROUD OF WHAT YOU SAID?

334
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
>> IT'S JUST A FACT.

335
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIREARMS.

336
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
PEOPLE -- I'M AN INSTRUCTOR.

337
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND WHEN I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO

338
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
SHOOT, YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR FACE

339
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
LIGHT UP THE FIRST TIME THEY

340
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
SHOOT A FIREARM.

341
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY EXPECTED.

342
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
IT IS A LOT OF FUN.

343
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
IT'S THE NATURE OF GUNS.

344
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
IT'S BEEN A PART OF OUR COUNTRY

345
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
FOR 250 YEARS.

346
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS A TIME

347
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
TO THINK ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN

348
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
WHEN 20 CHILDREN AGED 5 YEARS

349
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
OLD ARE BEING BLOWN TO PIECES BY

350
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A WEAPON THAT IS FREELY

351
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY?

352
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> WELL, YOU NEED TO ASK THE

353
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
REPORTER, BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE

354
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THAT APPROACHED ME WITH THE

355
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS.

356
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I SIMPLY ANSWERED THEM.

357
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO

358
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
UNDERSTAND.

359
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HE WAS NOT A GUN PERSON, DIDN'T

360
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.

361
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
SO I WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

362
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND BE

363
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HELPFUL AND EDUCATE ME.

364
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WHY DOES ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHO

365
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
IS NOT IN THE MILITARY OR THE

366
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
POLICE FORCE NEED A

367
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON THAT CAN

368
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
UNLEASH HUNDREDS OF SHOTS IN A

369
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES AND

370
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT AMERICANS?

371
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> WE DO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A

372
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
MACHINE GUN.

373
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.
>> I DIDN'T --

374
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MACHINE

375
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
GUNS.

376
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> I UNDERSTAND VERY CAREFULLY.

377
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
MY BROTHER IS A BRITISH COLONEL.

378
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I KNOW WHAT WEAPONS ARE.

379
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
IT'S A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

380
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
IT'S THE SAME RIFLE THAT WAS

381
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
USED IN AURORA.

382
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
AND I HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE

383
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
AFFECTED BY THAT TONIGHT WITH ME

384
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
TONIGHT LIVE AFTER THIS.

385
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AND ALSO IN THE OREGON SHOPPING

386
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
MALL SHOOTING.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MACHINE

387
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
CAN DO.

388
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT DID TO

389
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
THESE CHILDREN.

390
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU

391
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

392
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WEAPON AND THE TYPE OF WEAPONS

393
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
LIKE IT SHOULD BE FREELY

394
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AVAILABLE TO AMERICANS WHEN THEY

395
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ARE BEING USED FOR A SERIES, AND

396
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IT ACCEPT DEEM MICK NOW.

397
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SIX OF THE WORST MASS SHOOTINGS

398
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
IN AMERICAN SHOOTINGS HAVE

399
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OCCURRED SINCE 2007.

400
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WHY YOU PERSIST IN WANTING THIS

401
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
TO BE FREELY AVAILABLE TO

402
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
AMERICANS.

403
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> WELL, AUTOMOBILES KILL MORE

404
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS THAN GUNS

405
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
DO, BUT WE DON'T SAY WE

406
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE SOME

407
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
MANIAC THAT IS DRUNK ENDS UP
DRIVING A CAR INTO A FAMILY AND

408
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
KILLING THEM.

409
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THIS WAS A MISUSE OF SOMETHING

410
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
BY CLEARLY SOMEBODY THAT WAS
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

411
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
WHY SHOULD THEN THE REST OF THE

412
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
COUNTRY WITH THE HUNDREDS OF

413
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
MILLIONS OF GUNOWNERS IN AMERICA

414
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG

415
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WITH THEIR GUNS, WHY ARE WE

416
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
TURNING THEM, AS IF THIS WAS

417
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEIR FAULT?

418
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THIS IS NOT THEIR FAULT.

419
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THIS WAS A MANIAC IN A STATE

420
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THAT HAD A LOT OF GUN CONTROL IN

421
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A GUN-FREE ZONE THAT IGNORED

422
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
EVERY LAW THERE WAS AND MURDERED

423
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ALL THOSE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

424
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>> DO YOU WANT ANY MORE FORM OF

425
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
GUN CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY?
YOU'RE QUITE HAPPY WITH WHERE

426
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THINGS ARE?

427
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

428
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
CRIME HAS BEEN FALLING IN

429
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
AMERICA.

430
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
IN FACT, SINCE THE ASSAULT

431
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WEAPON BAN THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE

432
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
YEARS AGO BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN,

433
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
EVEN WHEN AFTER THAT EXPIRED,

434
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
OUR CRIME RATES CONTINUED TO GO

435
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
DOWN IN AMERICA.

436
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IS DOWN.

437
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN DIDN'T

438
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
DO --

439
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE GET KILLED

440
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WITH GUNS, GET MURDERED WITH

441
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
GUNS A YEAR IN YOUR COUNTRY?

442
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
DO YOU KNOW?

443
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> WELL, MOST OF IT IS EITHER

444
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
SUICIDES OR CRIMINAL-ON-CRIMINAL

445
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
SHOOTINGS.

446
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>> THAT WASN'T WHAT I ASKED YOU.

447
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

448
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
>> SOMEWHERE 20,000 --
>> I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT

449
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SUICIDES.

450
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I ASKED YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE

451
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS IN AMERICA ON

452
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
AVERAGE IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE

453
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
YEARS.

454
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DO YOU KNOW THAT FIGURE?

455
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
>> I DON'T BECAUSE THE FBI

456
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
CLUMPS IT TOGETHER WITH

457
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SUICIDES.

458
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
>> THEY DON'T, ACTUALLY.

459
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND.

460
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
IT'S ABOUT 11,000 TO 12,000.

461
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY --

462
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT NUMBER.

463
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THAT MAKES SENSE.

464
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ON
AVERAGE GET KILLED IN BRITAIN OR

465
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
GERMANY OR AUSTRALIA?

466
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AND I PARTICULARLY MENTION

467
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE

468
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
IN 1996 WE HAD A VERY SIMILAR

469
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
ATTACK IN DUNBLANE IN SCOTLAND

470
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THAT KILLED 16 YOUNG CHILDREN.

471
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WE INSTITUTED A HANDGUN BAN.

472
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
IN AUSTRALIA THEY WENT FURTHER.

473
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THEY HAD A GOVERNOR INITIATIVE

474
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
TO BRING BACK GUNS.

475
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THEY WOULD GIVE PEOPLE MONEY IN
RETURN FOR THE GUNS.

476
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THEY BANNED ASSAULT WEAPONS OF

477
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THE TYPE YOU'RE SEEING HERE

478
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CAUSING THIS TRAGEDY.
AND GUESS WHAT?

479
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MORE

480
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN,

481
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
IN DUNBLANE SINCE THAT BAN CAME

482
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
IN.
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO MASS

483
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
SHOOTING IN AUSTRALIA WHATSOEVER

484
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SINCE 1996.

485
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
AND I SAY TO YOU --

486
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> THE CRIME RATES OF GUNS HAVE

487
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
DOUBLED.

488
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> I SAY TO YOU AGAIN, THIS

489
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
STATISTIC OF 11,000 TO 12,000

490
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
MURDERS FROM GUNS, IT IS WAY,

491
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WAY AHEAD OF ANY OF THE

492
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF THIS

493
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WORLD.

494
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
IT IS A DISGRACE TO AMERICA AND

495
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IT'S

496
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
CONTINUED TO HAPPEN.

497
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
AND THE REASONS IT HAPPENS, AND

498
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I SAY THIS WITH RESPECT TO YOU,

499
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
IS YOUR FACETIOUS ATTITUDE

500
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
COMPARING IT TO CARS.

501
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER 20

502
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
CHILDREN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES,

503
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
YOU STILL SEE NO PROBLEM IN THIS

504
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
RIDICULOUS ASSAULT WEAPON BEING

505
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
FREELY AVAILABLE ON THE STREETS

506
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND THAT MAY BE

507
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A LOAD OF OTHER DERANGED YOUNG

508
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
MEN WHO WANT TO MAKE A NAME FOR

509
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THEMSELVES WHO CAN JUST GO AND

510
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
GET ONE AND FIND IT EASIER TO

511
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
BUY ONE THAT IT IS TO BUY A PET.

512
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
THIS IS SHAMEFUL TO AMERICA.

513
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE ALLOWING

514
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
IT TO CONTINUE.

515
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GUNS

516
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
BEING FUN ON ABOUT THIS BEING

517
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS, I SAY TO

518
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
YOU THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK

519
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN.

520
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
>> WELL, TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT

521
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THAT.

522
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHING

523
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
THAT ISSUE, ASKING THESE KINDS

524
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
OF QUESTIONS.

525
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
IF YOU THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE

526
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TALK TO

527
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SOME OF YOUR FELLOW PEOPLE IN

528
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THE PRESS.

529
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE

530
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

531
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'M TRYING TO ANSWER THEM.

532
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
>> THE DAY AFTER 20 CHILDREN ARE

533
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
MURDERED TO COMPARE THESE GUNS

534
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
TO FERRARIS.

535
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
>> HE ASKED ME A SERIES OF

536
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
QUESTIONS.

537
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
MOST DIDN'T GO ON THERE.

538
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS.

539
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE WORDS INTO
YOUR MOUTH.

540
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
>> NO.

541
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> AND I ASKED YOU TODAY IF YOU

542
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
WERE PROUD OF THEM, AND YOU

543
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
STOOD BY IT.

544
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
YOU SAID IT IS THE TRUTH.

545
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> IT IS THE TRUTH.

546
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

547
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS SHOULDN'T

548
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
BE SILENCING --

549
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TRUTH.

550
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
IT'S ABOUT THIS, SIR, WITH

551
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
REPRESENT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SECOND

552
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
AMENDMENT.

553
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BILL OF

554
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
RIGHTS THERE ARE ALREADY

555
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROLS IN THIS

556
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
COUNTRY, EXTENSIVE.

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SHOOTING AT THE EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING.

739
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THEY'RE ALL HERE TO SPEAK OUT IN

740
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF

741
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

742
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
FIRST IN LEE SHULL.

743
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
YOU'RE LEADING A CAMPAIGN REALLY

744
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
FROM NEWTOWN.

745
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
TELL ME ABOUT THIS.

746
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> PIERS, THANK YOU FOR HAVING

747
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ME ON.

748
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY

749
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
CONDOLENCES TO EVERYBODY IN OUR

750
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
COMMUNITY SUFFERING THROUGH

751
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
THIS, NOT ONLY THE 27 VICTIMS,

752
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
BUT THE CHILDREN AND THE

753
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TEACHERS THAT EXPERIENCED THE

754
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
TRAGEDY THEMSELVES.

755
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS AND

756
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
HAVE TO RELIVE THESE EVENTS.

757
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SO OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THEM.

758
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WOULD

759
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
MOST LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN?

760
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY

761
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TALK VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE

762
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
NEED TO DO SOMETHING, THAT DOING

763
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
NOTHING WAS NO LONGER AN OPTION.

764
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
WHAT SHOULD THAT SOMETHING BE?

765
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
>> I THINK IT'S A MULTITUDE OF

766
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THINGS, PIERS.

767
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
IT'S REASONABLE GUN CONTROL.

768
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
IT'S LOOKING AT EMOTIONAL

769
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
INSTABILITY.

770
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
IT'S EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR

771
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEING.

772
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
IT REALLY IS A MULTITUDE OF

773
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THINGS.

774
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
>> IN RELATION TO THE DEBATE

775
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL, IT SEEMS TO

776
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
BE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED NOW ON

777
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THESE SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES AND

778
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

779
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A BAN ON

780
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS, AS SENATOR

781
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
FEINSTEIN IS TRYING TO PUSH

782
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
THROUGH?

783
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
>> YES, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD.

784
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> YOU THINK THE AMERICAN --

785
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> I THINK MOST OF OUR

786
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
COMMUNITY -- EXCUSE ME.

787
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> NO, PLEASE.

788
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
AFTER YOU.

789
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> I THINK MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY

790
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
IS ON BOARD.

791
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I JUST CAME FROM A MEETING, AND

792
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT AN

793
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
IMMEDIATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

794
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
STARTING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

795
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
>> HOW IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

796
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SHE HAS LOST THREE OF HER

797
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
FRIENDS.

798
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY

799
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
TRAUMATIC FOR HER.

800
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
>> WELL, SHE WASN'T CLOSE WITH

801
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO

802
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
DIFFERENT IN AGE.

803
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
BUT THEY ARE FROM HER DANCE

804
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
STUDIO.

805
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
BUT WE HAVE THREE DEATHS WITHIN

806
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

807
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THE SHOOTER LIVED WITHIN MY

808
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

809
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WE LOST OUR FORMER BABY-SITTER,

810
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
LOST HER MOTHER.

811
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
SO IT'S ON MULTIPLE FRONTS.

812
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THE

813
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
COMMUNITY IS DOING THERE?

814
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
>> THEY'RE VERY STRONG.

815
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER.

816
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
IT'S REALLY -- THESE LAST TWO

817
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
DAYS HAVE BEEN A HORROR.

818
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS.

819
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVED TO DO

820
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
SOMETHING AND TO BE CALLED TO

821
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ACTION.

822
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.

823
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
>> AND AS PEOPLE ARE WATCHING

824
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THIS AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY
CAN HELP, WHAT IS THE BEST WAY

825
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF NEWTOWN TO

826
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
CONTRIBUTE?

827
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> WELL, TO CONTRIBUTE I THINK

828
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE IT'S

829
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
REALLY ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, IF

830
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
IT'S ONLY NEWTOWN THAT GOES

831
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
THROUGH THESE CHANGES AND TRIES

832
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
TO EFFECT THESE THINGS, THAT'S

833
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ONE SMALL PART.

834
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
WE ALL HAVE TO -- EVERY

835
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
COMMUNITY IN THIS NATION NEEDS

836
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN

837
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
HAPPEN IF WE HAVE PROLIFERATION

838
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
OF GUNS AND EMOTIONAL

839
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
INSTABILITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY,

840
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THIS CAN HAPPEN.

841
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
AND WE NEED ALL COMMUNITIES,

842
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
BASICALLY, TO RALLY THEIR LOCAL

843
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
AND STATE GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL

844
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
GOVERNMENT, AND GET OUR ELECTED

845
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
OFFICIALS TO HAVE THE MORAL

846
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
COURAGE TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH

847
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
OTHER AND HAVE COMMON SENSE

848
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
DISCUSSIONS AND LISTEN TO EACH

849
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
OTHER AND LISTEN TO THEIR POINTS

850
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
AND FIND SOME MIDDLE COMMON

851
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
GROUND.

852
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>> LEE SHULL, THANK YOU VERY

853
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.

854
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I DO APPRECIATE IT.

855
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
>> THANK YOU.

856
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
>> NOW I WANT TO BRING IN MY

857
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
SPECIAL GUESTS HERE IN THE

858
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
STUDIO, LOVED ONES OF THE

859
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
VICTIMS OF THE AURORA, COLORADO,

860
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SHOOTING, AND A SURVIVOR.

861
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WELCOME TO YOU ALL.

862
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
EVEN WHEN I'VE TALKED TO YOU IN

863
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
OUR GREEN ROOM, A LOT OF

864
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
EMOTION, A LOT OF ANGER, A LOT

865
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
OF GREAT SADNESS.

866
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW

867
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
YOU'VE ALL BEEN HEARING THAT SO

868
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

869
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
AURORA, ARGUABLY AN EVEN WORSE

870
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
TRAGEDY.

871
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
20 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN BLOWN TO

872
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
PIECES.

873
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
STEPHEN, LET ME START WITH THAT.

874
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
YOU WERE A VICTIM IN AURORA.

875
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
YOU WERE SHOT.

876
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
HOW YOU DOING PHYSICALLY, FIRST

877
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
OF ALL?

878
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
>> I'M SLOWLY RECOVERING.

879
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SOME NERVE DAMAGE IN MY LEFT

880
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ARM.

881
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, DOING

882
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
REALLY WELL.

883
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
>> IT'S NEARLY FIVE MONTHS TO

884
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THE DAY SINCE THE MASSACRE IN

885
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THAT MOVIE THEATER.

886
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
AND WE SEE THIS INCIDENT

887
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
HAPPENING IN NEWTOWN.

888
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
IT'S JUST BEYOND GROTESQUE.

889
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS WHEN YOU

890
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
HEARD OF HAD HAPPENED COMING TO

891
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

892
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> YEAH, I SAW THE INITIAL

893
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
REPORTS LIKE EVERYONE DID, THAT

894
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
MAYBE JUST THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN

895
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
KILLED.

896
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT WAS 27

897
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
PEOPLE MURDERED.

898
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
AND GROWING UP, HAVING GROWN UP

899
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
TEN MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD FROM

900
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THAT COMMUNITY, I COULDN'T

901
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
BELIEVE THAT ONCE AGAIN MY LIFE

902
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WAS GOING TO BE AFFECTED IN THIS

903
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
WAY BY SUCH HORRIBLE VIOLENCE.

904
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
>> YOU ACTUALLY LIVE LITERALLY

905
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
TEN MINUTES AWAY?

906
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
>> RIGHT.
THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP MY WHOLE

907
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
LIFE.

908
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>> WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT

909
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
AMERICA THAT YOU'RE ATTACKED IN

910
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
A MOVIE THEATER BY A YOUNG MAN

911
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
WITH AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE AND

912
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THEN TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM WHERE

913
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
YOU LIVE, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

914
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
IS SHOT UP WITH A YOUNG MAN WITH
EXACTLY THE SAME WEAPON?

915
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
>> IT'S CERTAINLY DISCOURAGING

916
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
IN SOME SENSE.

917
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAME AFTER

918
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
AURORA AND WHAT IS COMING AFTER

919
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THIS HORRIBLE EVENT IS COMMUNITY

920
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
COMING TOGETHER, BANDING

921
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
TOGETHER IN AN INCREDIBLY

922
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
POSITIVE WAY.

923
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AND I MEAN, THE SUPPORT I

924
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
RECEIVED FROM STRANGERS AFTER

925
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AURORA IS AMAZING.

926
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AND IT'S CLEAR IN SANDY HOOK THE

927
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SAME THING IS HAPPENING THERE.

928
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
>> THERESA AND DAVE, LET ME

929
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
RETURN TO YOU.

930
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
A.J. BOIK WAS YOUR SON.

931
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HE WAS YOUR NEPHEW, DAVE.

932
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

933
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
STATES SAID LAST NIGHT THAT

934
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THERE ARE FOUR OUTRAGES NOW ON

935
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
HIS WATCH INVOLVING MASS

936
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
SHOOTINGS.

937
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
HE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

938
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I KNOW YOU MET WITH THE

939
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
PRESIDENT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

940
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
AURORA.

941
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU THEN,

942
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
DAVE, AND WHAT HAPPENED?

943
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
>> WE WERE ALL GATHERED IN

944
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
AURORA, AND WE WERE SITTING IN

945
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
THE ROOM, WAITING FOR THE

946
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
PRESIDENT TO ARRIVE.

947
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AND HE WALKED IN AND GRACIOUS.

948
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE MEETING.

949
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
BUT HE STARTED IT OUT WITH I'M

950
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
NOT HERE AS THE PRESIDENT.
I'M HERE AS A FATHER.

951
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'M HERE AS A PARENT.

952
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
MY CHILDREN GO TO THE MOVIES.

953
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

954
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
WE NEED TO BE HOLDING OUR

955
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE.

956
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
WE NEED TO MAKE POSITIVE CHANGE

957
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
BECAUSE IT'S TOO LATE FOR A.J.,

958
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
BUT THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN

959
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
THROUGHOUT THAT ARE GOING TO BE

960
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
AFFECTED IF WE DON'T DO

961
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

962
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
AND TO THROW OUR HANDS UP AND TO

963
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
WALK AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE IS

964
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
LIKE SAYING IT'S OKAY THAT THIS

965
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
HAPPENED.

966
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING

967
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
ELSE ABOUT IT.
WE CAN'T CHANGE IT.

968
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
WELL, THAT'S GARBAGE.

969
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS

970
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

971
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
OUR COMMUNITY BACK.

972
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORLD BACK.

973
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
AND WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS

974
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
UNACCEPTABLE.

975
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT

976
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
SAY IT'S ILLEGAL TO STEAL.

977
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
BUT GUESS WHAT?

978
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
THOSE LAWS ARE STILL THERE

979
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE

980
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
BEHAVIOR.

981
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

982
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
WITH GUNS.

983
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE.

984
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
WE DON'T NEED THIS INDIVIDUAL TO

985
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
HAVE A GUN.

986
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
WE DON'T NEED -- WE NEED TO HAVE

987
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS DONE ON
EVERYBODY THAT PURCHASES A

988
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
FIREARM SO THAT WE CAN STOP

989
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING

990
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
THE GUNS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT

991
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
FOR THEM TO GET THESE WEAPONS,

992
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

993
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
TIME BEFORE THIS WREAKS HAVOC

994
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
AGAIN.

995
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> THERESA, THIS WAS YOUR BOY.
HE WAS 18.

996
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
>> YES.

997
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE

998
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
PARENTS IN SANDY HOOK NOW WHO

999
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
ARE TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH

1000
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THIS?

1001
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
>> WE ARE BEHIND THEM 100%.

1002
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WE KNOW EXACTLY

1003
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

1004
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
IT'S A TERRIBLE CLUB.

1005
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
BUT IT'S -- IT'S THE HARDEST
THING YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GO

1006
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THROUGH.

1007
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
AND YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE TO

1008
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
HAVE FAITH AND PUSH YOUR -- PUSH

1009
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
YOUR -- PUSH THIS LEGISLATION

1010
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
THROUGH.

1011
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
YOU GOT TO CALL YOUR CONGRESS.

1012
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
YOU GOT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW.

1013
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SCREAM IT FROM THE HILLS.

1014
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

1015
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
COLUMBINE SHOULDN'T HAVE

1016
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HAPPENED.

1017
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
AURORA SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

1018
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
VIRGINIA TECH SHOULDN'T HAVE

1019
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
HAPPENED.

1020
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
AND GOD FORBID THIS SHOULDN'T

1021
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
HAVE HAPPENED EITHER AT SANDY
HOOK.

1022
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
IT SHOULD NOT.

1023
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
>> AND CAREN, YOUR SON ALEX, HE

1024
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WAS 24.

1025
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS

1026
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
GIRLFRIEND AND SAVED HER, BUT HE

1027
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
LOST HIS LIFE.

1028
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
A HERO.

1029
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED

1030
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
SO SOON AFTERWARDS, ANOTHER

1031
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
OUTRAGE, MORE FAMILIES

1032
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
DECIMATED.

1033
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
AND YOU SEE THE GUN RIGHTS GUY

1034
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
TONIGHT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO

1035
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
ANYTHING.

1036
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
HE THINKS GUNS ARE FUN.

1037
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
YOU CAN'T PROHIBIT PEOPLE'S

1038
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
RIGHTS UNDER THE SECOND

1039
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
AMENDMENT.

1040
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

1041
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
>> I SAY TO THEM IT'S NOT ABOUT

1042
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1043
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT OUR SECOND

1044
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1045
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
IT'S ABOUT OUR RIGHTS, OUR

1046
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS TO JUST BE

1047
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
ABLE TO GO TO A MOVIE, TO JUST

1048
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
GO TO CHURCH, TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1049
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT IN

1050
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

1051
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
AND I THINK WE AS AMERICANS JUST

1052
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
NEED TO RISE TOGETHER AND SAY

1053
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

1054
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

1055
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
WE -- WE NEED TO REALLY RAISE

1056
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OUR VOICES AND BAND TOGETHER AND

1057
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
LET OUR LEADERS HEAR US.

1058
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
WE CAN'T JUST TURN OFF THE TV

1059
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
AND WALK AWAY.

1060
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
WE HAVE TO BE STRONG TOGETHER

1061
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
LIKE WE ARE TOGETHER.

1062
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000

EACH OTHER.

1065

1066
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
NIGHTMARE YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE.

1067
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AND WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE OUR

1068
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
VOICES HEARD.

1069
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK.
WE'LL COME BACK.

1070
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
MUCH MORE.

THESE INTEREST PEOPLE WHO REALLY

1074

1106
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
HER HOME, ONCE HE GOT HOME, HE

1107
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT TELLING US

1108
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
SOLD HIS RIFLE.

1109
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
>> IT WAS AN AR-15?

1110
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> IT WAS AN AR-15.

1111
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
WHEN HE GOT HOME, HE JUST

1112
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AND

1113
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
WENT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO

1114
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
DO, AND SOLD IT.

1115
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
>> LONNIE, WHEN YOU CAME ON MY

1116
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
SHOW LAST WEEK, AFTER ANOTHER

1117
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
SHOOTING IN THE SHOPPING MALL IN

1118
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OREGON, YOU BOTH ARE SUPPORTERS

1119
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
OF GUNS.

1120
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AND YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BEING

1121
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ANTI-GUN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

1122
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
MYTHS OF THIS DEBATE.

1123
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
IT'S JUST YOU WANT TO GET RID OF

1124
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
ALL GUNS.

1125
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT DEBATE,

1126
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
IT IS?

1127
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
>> NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

1128
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IN THIS CASE, THE SHOOTINGS HAD

1129
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
JUST HAPPENED.

1130
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THIS WOMAN WHOSE SON MURDERED

1131
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
HER AND MURDERED THE CHILDREN,

1132
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
IF SHE HAD BOUGHT MAYBE A GUN

1133
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
SAFE INSTEAD OF THE AR-15, SHE

1134
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE, AND SO

1135
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
WOULD ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

1136
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
WE DO NEED TO CHANGE THE LAWS.

1137
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
IF WE COULD START WITH BABY

1138
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
STEPS EVEN.

1139
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEMAND THAT THE

1140
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
AR-15 WOULD BE BANNED, BUT IT IS

1141
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A GREAT IDEA, AND I'M SURE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

1142
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
BUT YOU USE COMMON SENSE.

1143
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
GUNOWNERS -- I'M A GUNOWNER.

1144
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A

1145
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
GUNOWNER.
I'M GOING TO PROTECT MY HOUSE.

1146
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN -- THE

1147
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
BURGLARS IN TEXAS THAT.

1148
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE GONE BEFORE
THEY BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE,

1149
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
BECAUSE IT'S A FINAL JUDGMENT

1150
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
WHEN YOU GET BLOWN AWAY WITH A

1151
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
SHOTGUN.

1152
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
BUT THE GUN LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY

1153
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
NEED TO BE ENFORCED WHAT WE

1154
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
HAVE.
WE NEED TO IMPROVE THEM.

1155
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
WE NEED, LIKE DAVE SAID, WE NEED

1156
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
TO HAVE A SENSIBLE REGISTRATION.

1157
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE

1158
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
PEOPLE THAT GET AHOLD OF THESE

1159
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
GUNS.

1160
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THE LAST FOUR KILLINGS HAVE BEEN

1161
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
BY UNSTABLE MENTAL PEOPLE.

1162
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
>> LET ME BRING YOU IN HERE.

1163
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
YOU RUN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1164
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
BUT YOU HAVE A CONNECTION.

1165
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
YOUR OWN BROTHER WAS SHOT AT A
SHOOTING OF THE EMPIRE STATE

1166
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
BUILDING IN THE LATE '90s.

1167
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
WE'VE DEBATED THIS A LOT THIS
WEEK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE.

1168
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
IT'S A VERY EMOTIVE DEBATE.

1169
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
DO YOU FEEL THAT WE HAVE GOT TO

1170
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
A TIPPING POINT HERE, THAT THE

1171
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
MOOD HAS CHANGED?

1172
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
BECAUSE I FEEL IT HAS.

1173
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
>> UNDOUBTEDLY.

1174
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
AND THE BIG REASON IS BECAUSE

1175
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THESE VOICES THAT YOU HEAR, HAVE

1176
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
HERE ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT ARE

1177
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
BEING HEARD.

1178
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THESE INTEREST VOICES THAT NEED

1179
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
TO BE HEARD.

1180
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
ONE IN THREE AMERICANS KNOW

1181
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN SHOT.

1182
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
WE'RE NOT AS UNIQUE AS IT MIGHT

1183
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
SEEM.

1184
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
32 PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE

1185
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS EVERY SINGLE

1186
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
DAY, AND THE REALITY IS THE ONLY

1187
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
PLACE WHERE THIS IS A PARTISAN

1188
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN THE HALLS

1189
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
OF CONGRESS.

1190
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
AND WHAT THIS TRAGEDY IS DOING

1191
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
IS IT'S EXPOSING THAT DISCONNECT

1192
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
BETWEEN WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1193
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION WE

1194
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
WANT TO HAVE AND WHAT OUR
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE DOING

1195
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
ABOUT IT.

1196
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
AND TOMORROW WE'RE ALL GOING TO

1197
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO DELIVER 245

1198
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AND THE

1199
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PRESIDENT.

1200
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
>> IT SHOULDN'T BE A POLITICAL

1201
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
ISSUE.

1202
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> NO.

1203
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
>> IN AUSTRALIA AND IN BRITAIN

1204
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WHEN THEY HAD THE SIMILAR

1205
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
OUTRAGES, IT WASN'T ABOUT
POLITICS.

1206
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
IT WASN'T LEFT OR RIGHT.

1207
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> NO.

1208
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> IT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE POWER
GETTING ACTION.

1209
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
JESSICA, LET ME COME TO YOU.

1210
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUITE
EXTRAORDINARY STORY.

1211
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
AND TELL ME QUICKLY THE

1212
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
CONNECTIONS YOU HAVE TO VARIOUS

1213
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1214
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> MY HUSBAND WAS A STUDENT AT

1215
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
COLUMBINE.

1216
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
HE WAS UNINJURED, BUT

1217
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
EMOTIONALLY SCARRED.

1218
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> HE SAW TWO STUDENTS KILLED?

1219
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
>> CORRECT.

1220
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
AND THEN THE LITTLE GIRL I BABY

1221
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
SAT WAS KILLED IN PLATTE CANYON

1222
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HIGH SCHOOL IN BAILEY, COLORADO

1223
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
IN 2006.

1224
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD?

1225
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD.

1226
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AND BY A DERANGED GUNMAN WHO

1227
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
RANDOMLY ENTERED THAT SCHOOL.

1228
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AND THEN MY COUSIN WAS KILLED AT
THE AURORA THEATER.

1229
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
AND SITTING NEXT TO HIM WAS MY

1230
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL

1231
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
CLASSMATE, AND HE WAS SHOT THREE

1232
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
TIMES, BUT SURVIVED.

1233
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> AND JUST PURE CHANCE.
THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1234
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1235
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
>> SO YOU HAVE AN ASTONISHING

1236
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
CONNECTION TO SO MANY OF THESE

1237
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1238
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> YES.

1239
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
>> SO THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE,

1240
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
YOU'VE BEEN TAINTED BY WHAT IS

1241
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
GOING ON.

1242
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
>> UH-HUH.

1243
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> WHY ARE THE AMERICANS SO

1244
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
RELUCTANT TO COLLECTIVELY RISE

1245
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
UP AND DEMAND ACTION, DO YOU

1246
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THINK?

1247
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY

1248
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
TAKES SOMEBODY IN OUR POSITION

1249
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
ONCE WE'VE LOST SOMEBODY, ONCE

1250
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WE'VE KNOWN SOMEBODY WHO IS

1251
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
INJURED AND ARE -- THEY'VE GOT

1252
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
LASTING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

1253
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
SYNDROME TO REALLY SEE THE

1254
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
EFFECTS AND DAMAGES IT CAUSES,

1255
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNFORTUNATELY A
VERY UNIQUE CLUB.

1256
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
>> JERRI, LET ME BRING YOU IN
HERE.

1257
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
YOUR SON MATT, HE WAS 27.

1258
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
HE ALSO DIED SHIELDING HIS

1259
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
GIRLFRIEND, ANOTHER HERO IN

1260
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
AURORA IN THAT MOVIE THEATER.

1261
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT HIS

1262
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE POLICE.

1263
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
AND HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A

1264
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
FAMILY THAT RESPECTED GUNS.

1265
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
>> YES.

1266
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
HE PROBABLY STARTED LEARNING THE

1267
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
RESPECT OF GUNS, LIKE YOU SAID,

1268
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
MY FATHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER

1269
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
FOR 23 YEARS.

1270
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
AND WHEN MY BOYS WERE LITTLE, HE

1271
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
WOULD TAKE THEM TO HIS SHOOTING

1272
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
RANGE ON HIS PROPERTY.

1273
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BUT HE ALSO TAUGHT THEM NOT ONLY

1274
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
HOW TO SHOOT A GUN, BUT HOW TO

1275
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
RESPECT IT.

1276
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AND SO WE'RE NOT -- AS FAR AS

1277
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
OUR FAMILY IS CONCERNED, MY

1278
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
HUSBAND AND I WERE NOT AGAINST

1279
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
GUNS.

1280
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY NEEDS

1281
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
THESE AR-15s.

1282
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HUNT, YOU'RE

1283
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
NOT GOING TO SHOOT.

1284
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
>> THESE ARE MILITARY WEAPONS.

1285
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
>> RIGHT.

1286
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
>> TO FIRE OFF 100

1287
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
MAGAZINE-POWERED GUNS IN THE WAY

1288
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
THAT HAPPENED IN AURORA, NO

1289
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
AMERICAN CIVILIAN NEEDS THAT

1290
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OUTSIDE OF THE MILITARY AND THE

1291
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
POLICE FORCE.

1292
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THAT IS WHAT ANGERS ME.

1293
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THAT'S WHAT THE DEBATE SHOULD BE

1294
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
FOCUSED ON.

1295
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
AMANDA WAS YOUR SISTER, MICAYLA,

1296
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
WHO DIED AT 23 IN AURORA.

1297
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
AND ANITA, YOUR COUSIN.

1298
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
NOT ONLY DO YOU FEEL STRONGLY

1299
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
ABOUT THE FUNDRAISING THAT WENT

1300
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
ON AFTER THIS.

1301
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POURS IN.

1302
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
YOU'RE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENS

1303
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
WITH IT AND PEOPLE TRYING TO

1304
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
HELP WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

1305
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
FAMILIES AT SANDY HOOK.

1306
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
>> WE LEARNED A LOT IN AURORA

1307
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
WITH PEOPLE.

1308
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
AFTER ONE OF THESE NATIONAL

1309
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
TRAGEDIES HAPPENS, THERE IS ALL

1310
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THESE FUNDS STARTING UP THAT

1311
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY

1312
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
GENEROUS AND VERY GRACIOUS.

1313
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
AND THEY DO WANT TO HELP.

1314
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
AND THEY GIVE MONEY, AND THEY

1315
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
GIVE MONEY TO NONPROFITS.

1316
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
AND WHAT WE FOUND IN AURORA IS

1317
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THAT THEY WERE GIVING MONEY TO A

1318
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
NONPROFIT THAT THEN GIVES TO IT

1319
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
OTHER NONPROFITS.

1320
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
WE'VE STARTED AS A GROUP

1321
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
EVERYONE HERE A ORGANIZATION

1322
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
CALLED VICTIMS FIRST.

1323
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
VICTIMSFIRST.ORG.

1324
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE

1325
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THAT THE SANDY HOOK VICTIMS DO

1326
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
NOT GET VICTIMIZED LIKE WE DID

1327
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THIS.

1328
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
HAPPENED TO THE VICTIMS OF 9/11

1329
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WHERE A HANDFUL OF FAMILIES HAD

1330
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
TO STAND UP AND STOP THE MONEY

1331
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
FROM GOING ELSEWHERE.

1332
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
IT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY WITH

1333
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
HURRICANE SANDY.

1334
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
YOU HAD THE STATEN ISLAND

1335
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
BOROUGH PRESIDENT COME OUT AND

1336
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
SAY STOP GIVING MONEY.

1337
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF IT.

1338
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
AND IT'S JUST GOT TO STOP.

1339
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.

1340
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
AND I WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS

1341
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
WITH THAT, AMANDA.

1342
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I CAN SEE YOU'RE VERY DISTRAUGHT

1343
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ABOUT THIS.

1344
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IF THERE IS ONE THING YOU COULD

1345
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SAY TO PEOPLE ABOUT GUNS, WHAT

1346
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
WOULD YOU SAY?

1347
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
>> GOD, PIERS, PUT ME ON THE

1348
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
SPOT HERE.

1349
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'M ABSOLUTELY AGAINST GUNS IN

1350
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
ANY FASHION.

1351
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
HUNT ME SOME DEER, BUT GOD, WE

1352
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
DON'T NEED THEM ON THE STREETS

1353
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
IN ANY FASHION.

1354
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
>> I THINK THE WORDS EVERYONE

1355
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
SHOULD TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY,

1356
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM FAMILIES

1357
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
SUCH AS YOURS.

1358
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

1359
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
JOINING ME.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

1360
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL USE

1361
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO

1362
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
ENSURE THERE ARE NO MORE

1363
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE IN

1364
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CONNECTICUT.

1365
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN THE GUN

1366
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
POLICIES WILL CHANGE.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE

1367
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
COME BACK.

1368
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YOU ARE A BUSINESS PRO.

1369
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
OMNIPOTENT OF OPPORTUNITY.

1370
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
YOU KNOW HOW TO MIX BUSINESS...

1371
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
WITH BUSINESS.

1372
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
AND YOU...RENT FROM NATIONAL.

1373
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
BECAUSE ONLY NATIONAL LETS YOU
CHOOSE ANY CAR IN THE AISLE.

1374
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
AND GO.

1375
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A FULL-SIZE
OR ABOVE.

1376
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
AND STILL PAY
THE MID-SIZE PRICE.

1377
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

1378
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YES, YOU COULD BUSINESS PRO.

1379
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
YES, YOU COULD.

1380
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
GO NATIONAL. GO LIKE A PRO.

1381
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
HURRY IN AND TRY
FIVE SUCCULENT ENTREES,

00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
UNDER 100 CALORIES.

1390
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
NATURE VALLEY GRANOLA THINS.

1391
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID LAST

1392
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
NIGHT IN NEWTOWN HE WAS GOING TO

1393
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
DO SOMETHING.

1394
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL HE DO?

1395
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
JOINING ME IS CHARLES BLOW FROM

1396
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

1397
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED PRETTY

1398
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
FIRED UP AND HE SEEMED PRETTY

1399
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
DETERMINED.

1400
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
IS HE GOING TO DO ANYTHING?

1401
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
AND IF HE DOES, WHAT IS HE GOING

1402
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
TO DO?

1403
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.

1404
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
WE'VE HAD AT LEAST FOR THE LAST

1405
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
FIVE YEARS IF NOT FOR THE LAST

1406
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
TEN IS A DAMPENING DOWN OF KIND

1407
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
OF DISCUSSION OF PEOPLE WHO WANT

1408
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
TO SEE SOME SORT OF SENSIBLE GUN

1409
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
CONTROL RESTRICTIONS.

1410
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
AND IN THAT VOID, THE NRA AND

1411
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
GUN, PRO-GUN ADVOCATES HAVE

1412
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
ACTUALLY GROWN STRONGER.

1413
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
YOU WOW WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MAYBE

1414
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THEY SAW THERE WASN'T AS MUCH

1415
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
OPPOSITION AND DIDN'T HAVE TO

1416
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
SPEND MUCH MONEY.

1417
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
IN FACT, THEIR SPENDING HAS

1418
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
INCREASED.

1419
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
SO NOW YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN

1420
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
CONTROL LOBBY IS PROBABLY ONE

1421
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
PEOPLE KNOW MOST IS THE BRADY

1422
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
CAMPAIGN.

1423
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THE NRA SPENDS ABOUT 66 TIMES AS

1424
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
MUCH ON LOBBYING AS THE BRADY

1425
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
CAMPAIGN.

1426
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
AND THEY SPENT DURING THE

1427
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTING TO

1428
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
CANDIDATES 4100 TIMES AS MUCH AS

1429
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1430
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THIS HAS NOW BECOME A ONE-SIDED

1431
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
DISCUSSION, AND AMERICA DESERVES

1432
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
A DISCUSSION.

1433
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
>> THIS HAS BEEN A TIPPING

1434
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
POINT.

1435
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I THINK IT WAS SO GROTESQUE,

1436
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
COMING ON THE BACK OF AURORA,

1437
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WHICH IN ITSELF WAS HORRIFYING

1438
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
BEYOND BELIEF, A MOVIE THEATER,

1439
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
NOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

1440
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
BARACK OBAMA AFTER BEING

1441
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
REELECTED, HE HAS TO THINK OF A

1442
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
LEGACY NOW.

1443
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
DOES HE WANT HIS LEGACY TO BE A

1444
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
SERIES OF FURTHER MASS SHOOTINGS

1445
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
IN WHICH HE DID NOTHING.

1446
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE

1447
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
MORE MASS SHOOTINGS.

1448
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR ALREADY IN

1449
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF

1450
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
INCREASING APPALLING DETAIL.

1451
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE WORSE.

1452
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
>> I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT IN

1453
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THE SENSE THAT EVERY CAUSE HAS

1454
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
AN INFLECTION POINT.

1455
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
AND THIS MAY BE THE INFLECTION

1456
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
POINT FOR THE CAUSE OF PEOPLE

1457
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
WHO WANT TO AT LEAST SEE A

1458
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
REINSTATEMENT OF THE ASSAULT

1459
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1460
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO

1461
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
DO AS A SOCIETY, AND WHAT I HOPE

1462
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE PREPARED

1463
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
TO DO IS TO SAY WE HAVE TO START

1464
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
ON -- START STOPPING THE

1465
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
PROLIFERATION OF GUNS IN A

1466
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
SOCIETY.

1467
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
WHAT WE'RE FAST APPROACHING AT

1468
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
THE MOMENT IS WHERE WE WILL HAVE

1469
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
MORE GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN

1470
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
WE HAVE HUMAN BEINGS.

1471
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
>> ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE ABOUT 300

1472
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
MILLION GUNS IN CIRCULATION.

1473
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THE POPULATION IS --

1474
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
>> 311, RIGHT.

1475
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
>> HOW MANY CHILDREN.

1476
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> RIGHT.

1477
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
>> YOU ALREADY HAVE MORE GUNS

1478
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
THAN THERE ARE ADULTS IN

1479
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
AMERICA.

1480
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
>> ACCORDING TO GALLUP, 45% OF

1481
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY HAVE

1482
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
A GUN IN THEIR HOME THAT MEANS

1483
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN

1484
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
ONE GUN IN THEIR HOMES.

1485
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE SAY THEY

1486
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
HAVE ACTUALLY FIRED A GUN THIS

1487
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THEIR LIFETIMES.

1488
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THAT MEANS WE AS A CULTURE ARE

1489
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
GETTING TO A SATURATION POINT

1490
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
FROM WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

1491
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
PULL BACK.

1492
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AFTER

1493
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
THESE SHOOTINGS, UNLIKE WHAT WE

1494
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WHERE PEOPLE

1495
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
SAY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

1496
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
ABOUT THIS, WE NEED TO STOP

1497
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
BUYING GUNS.

1498
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
IN COLORADO AFTER THAT SHOOTING

1499
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUNS

1500
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
WENT UP BY MORE THAN 40%.

1501
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

1502
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
STOP, THEY FEEL LESS SAFE AND

1503
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THEY RUSH TO BUY MORE GUNS AND

1504
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
WHAT WE ARE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T

1505
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
HAVE THE ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER

1506
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
SIDE, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SAY

1507
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, I

1508
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO NOT BEAR

1509
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
ARMS, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO

1510
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
FEEL SAFE.

1511
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
WHO IS MY ADVOCATE WHO SAYS THAT

1512
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
FOR THIS PERSON WHO DECIDES THAT

1513
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I DON'T WANT TO OWN A GUN, HOW

1514
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
DO WE MAKE THAT PERSON FEEL SAFE

1515
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
OR DOES THAT PERSON GET TO A

1516
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
POINT WHERE THEY SAY BECAUSE 50,

1517
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
60, WHATEVER IT GETS TO BE,

1518
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS A
GUN, I ACTUALLY NEED TO GET ONE

1519
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

1520
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
>> THE POINT IS THERE IS ALREADY

1521
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROL IN THE

1522
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
COUNTRY.

1523
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
THE GUN LOBBY MAKES OUT THIS

1524
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
HIDEOUS NEW THING DESIGNED TO

1525
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
SHACKLE THEM BUT THIS PARTICULAR

1526
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
TYPE OF RIFLE IS NOW THE

1527
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
PREFERRED MASS SHOOTER'S

1528
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
INSTRUMENT OF DEVASTATING MURDER

1529
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
AND THAT IS WHY IT HAS TO BE

1530
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
TARGETED.

1531
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
THE LAST THREE SHOOTINGS, THE

1532
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
AR-15 WAS USED BECAUSE IT LOOKS

1533
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
AS THE GUNN RIGHTS TOLD ME LIKE

1534
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS.

1535
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
THIS HE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF

1536
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
CIRCULATION.

1537
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
>> YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1538
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
COMMITTING THESE MASS SHOOTINGS

1539
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WITH REGULAR HUNTING RIFLES OR

1540
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
MASS SHOOTINGS WITH REGULAR

1541
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
REINVOLVERS.

1542
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
THESE ARE SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS,

1543
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
AND THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION.

1544
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
A GUEST WAS SAYING THIS IS NOT

1545
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

1546
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

1547
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
DOES.

1548
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE TRIGGER

1549
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
GO -- THAT THE HAMMER GO ALL THE

1550
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
WAY BACK AND YOU SQUEEZE AGAIN

1551
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
REALLY HARD.

1552
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
THE TRIGGERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

1553
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
YOU JUST PULSE THE FINGER.

1554
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
YOU CAN GET OFF THREE TO FIVE

1555
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
ROUNDS IN ONE SECOND.

1556
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1557
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THE POWER OF A AUTOMATIC AND THE

1558
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
AR-15s IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT
EQUIPMENT.

1559
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THAT'S THE REALITY.

1560
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1561
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
A Hybrid? Most are
just no fun to drive.

1562
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Now, here's one that will
make you feel alive.

1563
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Meet the five-passenger
Ford C-MAX Hybrid.

1564
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
C-MAX says ha.

1565
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
C-MAX says wheeee.

1566
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Which is what you get,
don't you see?

1567
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Cause C-MAX has lots more
horsepower than Prius v,

1568
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
a hybrid that C-MAX
also bests in MPG.

1569
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Say hi to the all-new 47
combined MPG C-MAX Hybrid.

1570
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
>>> SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

1571
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
THAT COULD LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1572
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND

1573
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
TO SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1574
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH SHE

1575
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE SHE

1576
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
SHOWED US IS REMARKABLE.

1577
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1578
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I AM SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

1579
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> SPEAKING OVER THE WEEKEND AND

1580
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY GUESTS

1581
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
FOR HE CAN HERE AND WE LEAVE YOU

1582
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
POWERFUL WORDS FROM MR. PARKER.

1583
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
HIS DAUGHTER WAS KILLED AT THE

1584
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY AND HE

1585
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
GAVE US A STATEMENT.

1586
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
THANKING THOSE HE REACHED OUT TO

1587
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
HELP THE FAMILIES AND HE WENT ON

1588
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
TO SAY THIS, REMEMBER THE

1589
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND KEEP THEM

1590
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS AND DO NOT

1591
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
LET THEIR BRIGHT SHANING FIESS

1592
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
BECOME EXTINGUISHED.

1593
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
LET US DO EVERYTHING IN OUR

1594
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
POWER TO ENSURE THEIR LIGHT

1595
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
CONTINUES TO SHINE BRIGHTER AND

1596
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
BRIGHTER IN ALL THAT WE DO TO

1597
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
REMEMBER THEM.

1598
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
THAT'S ALL FOR US TONIGHT.

1599
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
IS SPENDING LESS TIME
LYING AWAKE

1600
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
WITH ANNOYING ACHES AND PAINS
AND MORE TIME ASLEEP.

1601
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
ADVIL PM®. THE DIFFERENCE
IS A BETTER NIGHT'S SLEEP.
