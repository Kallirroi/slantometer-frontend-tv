00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
IT MUST HAVE HAVE BEEN A

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
IT IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OUR TOWN BUT IT WILL NOT

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
DEFINE US.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I WILL THINK OF THOSE 27

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SOULS LOST JUST A FEW DAYS

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000

EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
AND DREAM OF THE LIVES THAT

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND THE

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000

GOD HAS CALLED THEM ALL

FOR THOSE OF US WHO REMAIN,

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
LET US FIND THE STRENGTH TO

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CARRY ON.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
MAKE OUR COUNTRY WORTHY OF

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000

RICK, THE MOTHER NANCY WAS

SHOT FOUR TIMES IN THE HEAD

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
AND FOUND IN HER OWN HOME

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
STILL WEARING HER PAJAMAS

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
AND THAT'S WHERE WE BELIEVE

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL PICK UP

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
TODAY.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
WHAT IS THE FOCUS NOW AS WE

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

INVESTIGATORS IS DETERMINING

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WHAT MIGHT HAVE PROPELLED

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000

DOWN 26 OTHER INNOCENTS.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WE HAVE LEARNED, THROUGH

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT ADAM

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LANZA HAD A FORM OF AUTISM

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
KNOWN AS ASPERGER'S.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THAT HE WAS TROUBLED.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THAT HE SPENT MOST OF HIS

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TIME/8w INSIDE THE FAMILY HOME

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
AND THAT FRIDAY MORNING HE

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WOKE UP, WENT TO HIS

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
MOTHER'S BEDROOM AND SHOT

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
HERSELF TIMES IN THE HEAD
BEFORE TAKING FOUR OF HER

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000

INVESTIGATORS ARE POURING
OVER A SMASHED COMPUTER

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
FOUND IN THE FAMILY HOME.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
ALSO GOING THROUGH PHONE AND

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
CREDIT CARD RECORDS, LOOKING

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
FOR ANY AND ALL TYPES OF

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
CLUES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SOME ANSWERS HERE.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THERE MAY NOT BE ANY AS YOU

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
KNOW, BILL.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE

MOTHER, TOOK HER SON

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SHOOTING.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THAT'S WHERE HE LEARNED HOW

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
TO SHOOT APPARENTLY, THE

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WEAPONS THAT HER MOTHER

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
LEGALLY OWNED.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
BUT BEYOND THAT

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE A LOT OF

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
QUESTIONS STILL TO ANSWER.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
BILL: IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THINK AMOUNT OF DEVASTATION

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
CAUSED IN 10 MINUTES OR LESS

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
ACCORDING TO POLICE.

128
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
POLICE THAT THIS COULD HAVE

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BEEN EVEN WORSE THAN WE KNOW

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
IT TODAY.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE, RICK?

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> Reporter: WELL, HE WAS

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
IT IS AN AR-15 MILITARY

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ASSAULT WEAPON.
IT IS THE MOST POWER GULL

AR-15 ASSAULT TYPE WEAPON.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
IT HAD HIGH CAPACITY

OR IN THAT CLASSROOM THAT

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WENT UNUSED.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
NOW, POLICE HAVE BEEN VERY

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
CAUTIOUS ON THESE PRESS

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
CONFERENCES.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A LOT OF INFORMATION FRANKLY

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WENT OUT ON FRIDAY AND

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000

INFORMATION WAS PULLED BACK.

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I THOUGHT THE INFORMATION

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
THEY GAVE OUT LAST NIGHT WAS

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
PRECIOUS AND FEW.

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WHEN IT CAME TO FACTS.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
DO WE BELIEVE THROUGH THE, I

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
MURDERER THEY ARE ALWAYS

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
FUELED BY WHITE HOT RAGE.

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM SERIAL

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
KILLERS, COOL, PLODDING,

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
STALKING, DRIVEN BY LUST.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
MASS MURDERERS ARE

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
DIFFERENT.
SO SOMETHING TOUCHED OFF THE

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
RAGE AND I THINK IT HAD TO

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
DO WITH SOMETHING ODD IN THE

386
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
MOTHER AND HIM PARTICULARLY

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AS HE IS IS, SHE IS TRYING

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
TO FIND PLACES AROUND THE

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
COUNTRY HE COULD GO TO

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
DIFFERENT COLLEGE.

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
BILL: YEAH.

393
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
BILL, I WANT YOU TO ADD TO

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THAT, BUT I WANT YOU TO

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
CONSIDER THIS AS WELL.

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THE PEOPLE WHO I TALK TO IN

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SANDY HOOK, SAY THIS MOTHER

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING

399
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HUMANLY POSSIBLE SHE COULD

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
TO HELP HER OWN SON.

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND THIS WAS A LIFELONG

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
STRUGGLE FOR HER.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I THINK THERE WERE GOOD DAYS

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
AND FRANKLY THERE WERE BAD

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
DAYS.

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
FRIDAY WAS AN ABSOLUTE AWFUL

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
DAY.

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
QUESTION?

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
>> WELL, BILL, YOU KNOW, YOU

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
CAN ONLY TO A SMALL DEGREE

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAY

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN THAT

414
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
HOME AND, WITH HIM AND HIS

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
CONDITION AND HOW HIS MOTHER

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
WAS TRYING TO WORK WITH HIM.

417
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
WE'RE HEARING NOW SHE TOOK

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
HIM FOR OUTTO THE RANGE TO

419
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
USE, USE A WEAPON, YOU KNOW.

420
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
BUT ONE.

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
OTHER THINGS SHE WAS DOING

422
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
TO HELP HIM ALONG?

423
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SHE WAS DEDICATING HER LIFE

424
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
TO HIM.

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
HOWEVER I THINK ONE OF THE

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT IS

427
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
COMING OUT OF ALL THIS, BILL,

428
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THIS IS NUMBER ON DIFFERENT

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
LEVELS.
DISCUSSION ABOUT MENTAL

430
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
HEALTH.

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
IT IS DISCUSSION ABOUT

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ISSUES IN OUR SOCIETY.

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
IT'S THE DISCUSSION AROUND

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SCHOOL SAFETY AND SECURITY.

435
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
NONE OF THEM STAND ALONE.

436
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
IT BECOMES INTERMINGLE AND

437
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
COULD JOINED PROCESS.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
SO TO THINK ANY ONE OF THEM

439
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
BY THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE

440
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
TAKEN CARE OF THIS, I THINK

441
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
WOULD BE NAIVE.

442
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000

YARDS DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE

HAVE LEFT.

567
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
IT REALLY TUGS AT YOU.

568
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
IT'S A REMINDER OF A LOSS HOW

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
ABOUT THE INFORMATION THEY GIVE

579
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000

H -- MOVED TONEWTOWN.

587
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM.

588
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SOCIAL INTERACROSS WAS DIFFICULT

589
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
FOR THIS BOY.

590
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
HE WAS KNOWN IN HIGH SCHOOL TO

591
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
CARRY AROUND A BLACK BRIEFCASE

592
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
INSTEAD OF A BACKPACK AND HE

593
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
NEVER WANTED TO LET THAT

594
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
BRIEFCASE GO.

WITH HIS MOTHER.

598
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

599
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
HE FELT ABOUT THAT TRANSITION.

600
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WHETHER HE WAS OPEN TO THAT

601
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
TRANSITION IN HIS LIFE.

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THESE ARE THE THINGS PEOPLE ARE

603
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
PORING OVER AS THEY TRY TO

604
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
FIGURE OUT THE WHY, WHICH IS THE

605
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
HUGE QUESTION HERE.

606
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE LEARN FROM

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000

610
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
OF THIS AND WE ARE WORKING

611
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THROUGH IT.
WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S

612
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
HAPPENING.
THE SCHOOLS IN THIS AREA ARE

613
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
CLOSED.

614
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
BUT THE TOWN OF RIDGEFIELD ABOUT

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000

APPARENTLY THE SCHOOLS ARE UNDER

618
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
LOCKDOWN BECAUSE OF A SUSPICIOUS

619
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
PERSON AT THE NEARBY TRAIN

620
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000

WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL

621
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
AMOUNT TO ANYTHING, IT MAY BE A

622
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SENSE OF PARANOIA.

623
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
BUT THIS GOES ALONG WITH WHAT WE

624
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000

THERE WAS A STRONG WARNING THAT

632
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000

633
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000

TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SURROUNDING

688
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
THIS TRAGEDY AND HOW AND WHY IT

689
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
OCCURRED.

690
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THERE ARE MANY, MANY WITNESSES

691
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000

692
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000

SECONDARY CRIME SCENE

698
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
INDEFINITELY.
WE SEIZED IT UNDER SEARCH

WORK.
SO NOT TO READ ANYTHING INTO

702
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THAT.
IT'S COMMON PRACTICE TO HOLD

703
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
ONTO THE CRIME SCENE LONG IT'S

704
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000

IT'S A TENDER ISSUE.

768
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
ANY INTERVIEW WITH CHILDREN WILL

APPROPRIATE AND CERTAINLY THEY

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF

875
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000

THE CLOCK.

882
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
IT'S 9:42 SHAIS A.M.

883
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
IT WAS 72 HOURS AT THIS MOMENT

884
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
DOWN THIS STREET WHERE THE

885
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
BREAKING NEWS IN THE POLITICAL

891
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WORLD AS WAS MUCH ANTICIPATED.

892
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
REPRESENTATIVE TIM SCOTT WILL

893
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
REPLACE THE OUTGOING SENATOR JIM

894
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
DEMINT TO LEAD THE HERITAGE

895
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
FOUNDATION.

896
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
HE WILL MOVE ON TO DO THAT.

897
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
REPRESENTATIVE PARTICULAR SCOTT

898
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
HAS BEEN CHOSEN BY GOVERNOR

899
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
NIKKI HALEY TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

900
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
HE WILL BECOME A SENATOR.

901
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
BILL: IN THE AFTERMATH OF WHAT

902
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HAPPENED HERE IN NEWTOWN.

903
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
CALLS FOR A FEDERAL COMMISSION

904
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
ON VIOLENCE.

905
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS OF FOCUS

906
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
HERE.

907
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN IS LEADING

908
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THAT CHARGE.

909
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
HE'S MY GUEST AS WE ALL TRY AND

910
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
MAKE SENSE OF THIS.

911
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

912
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

913
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

914
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
significantly improve

915
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
lung function.

916
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

917
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

918
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

919
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

920
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

921
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
for sudden symptoms

922
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

923
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

924
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

925
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

926
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and some eye problems.

927
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

928
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

929
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

930
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

931
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
improve your lung function.

HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

1002
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000

AND IMPORTANT SPEECH HERE IN

1005
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
CONNECTICUT.
THIS IS COMPLICATED.

1006
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
BY THE FACT THAT IT'S

1007
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
COMPLICATED DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN

1008
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
TURN AWAY FROM IT OR LET IT GET

1009
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
STOPPED IN LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK

1010
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
BECAUSE THESE TRAGEDIES CONTINUE

1011
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
TO OCCUR.

1012
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THEY MEAN AS A SOCIETY WE ARE

1013
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
FAILING TO PROTECT OURSELVES.

1014
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
IN THE NEWTOWN CASE FAILING TO

1015
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
DO THE MOST ELEMENTAL

1016
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
RESPONSIBILITY OF A CIVIL

1017
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
SOCIETY AND THAT IS PROTECT OUR

1018
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000

I'M TALKING ABOUT A NATIONAL

1019
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000

1023
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000

I WANT TO ENGENDER -- I THINK

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
THE PRESIDENT DOES TOO, A

1025
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
NATIONAL CONVERSATION IN WHICH

1026
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WE ASK OURSELVES HOW CAN WE AS

1027
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
BEST PASS POSSIBLE STOP THIS

1028
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
FROM HAPPENING.

1029
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THERE IS A PATTERN HERE.

1030
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
MOST OF THESE HORRIFIC ACTS OF

1031
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
MASS VIOLENCE ARE COMMITTED BY

1032
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000

1033
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000

1034
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THEY WERE TROUBLED.

1035
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

1036
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT CULTURE,

1037
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
THEN THEY GET GUNS.

1038
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY TO

1039
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000

LIKE THIS WILL BE KILLED IN ONE

1051
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
WHERE CAN A COVERING LIKE THAT

1052
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000

I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A CLEAR

1053
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
ANSWER FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.

1054
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
>> I THOUGHT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

1055
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
SAID LOUISIANA NIGHT THE FACT

1056
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THAT IT'S COMPLICATED DOESN'T

1057
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
MEAN WHEN CAN'T DO ANYTHING

1058
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
ABOUT IT.
IF WE CAN SAVE THE LIFE OF ONE

1059
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
CHILD IN THE COUNTRY THEN IT'S

1060
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WORTH IT.

1061
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
BUT PART OF THIS ABOUT STABBING

1062
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
A COMMISSION IS TO MAKE SURE

1063
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000

1064
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000

1067
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THERE ARE THING WE CAN SAY TO

1068
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000

1069

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
THE HOST OF 10 FUNERALS THIS

1295
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
WEEK AND NEXT WEEK.

1296
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
IT REMINDS ME OF 9/11 WHEN WE

1297
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
SAW MULTIPLE FUNERALS TAKING

1298
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
PLACE IN LOCAL CHURCHES IN THIS

1299
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
AREA.
VERY, VERY HARD FOR THESE

1300
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
COMMUNITIES.
BILL: YOU CAN'T HIT A GOLF BALL

1301
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
OR THROW A SNOWBALL IN THIS TOWN

1302
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
WITHOUT HITTING A CHURCH OF SOME

1303
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
DENOMINATION.

1304
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
FAITH IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE

1305
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN NEWTOWN.

1306
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
THERE IS A MAKESHIFT MEMORIAL.

1307
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM SET UP

1308
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
THROUGHOUT TOWN.

1309
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
THIS IS THE AREA WHERE THEY SET

1310
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
UP 26 CHRISTMAS TREES OVER THE

1311
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
WEEKEND.
AND NOWER IN ALLOWING PEOPLE

1312
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
FROM THE COMMUNITY TO WALK THE

1313
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
HALF MILE DOWN THIS ROAD TO

1314
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
PLACE FLOWERS OR LAY A WREATH OR

1315
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
HANG AN ORNAMENT.

1316
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
THIS IS THE CLOSEST YOU CAN GET

1317
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1318
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
YOU HAVE TO GO 100 YARD DOWN

1319
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
DICKINSON LANE AND PEEL TO THE

1320
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
RIGHT IN THE PARKING LOT BEFORE

1321
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
THE SCHOOL REVEALS IN FRONT OF

1322
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
YOU.
THIS IS HOW WE GRIEVE AND THIS

1323
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
IS HOW SO MANY HAVE COME TO

1324
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
RECOGNIZE THE LIVES TAKEN FROM

1325
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
US.

1326
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
THREE DAYS AGREE WE HAVE SEEN

1327
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
SOME WOMEN COME DOWN FROM THE

1328
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
TOWN AND HUG EACH OTHER AS THEY

1329
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
GET CLOSE.
IF YOU WERE TO GO HALF A MILE

1330
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
DOWN FROM THAT CHRISTMAS TREE

1331
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
LOCATION YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT THE

1332
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
ONLY TRAFFIC LIGHT IN SANDY

1333
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
HOOK, AND WE WERE THERE A SHORT

1334
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
TIME AGO.

1335
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
THIS IS THE CHRISTMAS TREE SET

1336
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
UP IN THE VILLAGE OF SANDY HOOK.

1337
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
AND THERE ARE SO MANY POIGNANT

1338
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
ORNAMENTS AND REMINDERS AND

1339
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
ARTIFACTS GATHERED HERE.

1340
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
THIS MEMORIAL HAS GROWN

1341
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
ENORMOUSLY THE PAST FEW DAYS.

1342
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

1343
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
CHRISTMAS BULBS.

1344
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
THIS ONE OF NOAH POZNER.

1345
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
, A LEGO STAND.

1346
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
THIS CAUGHT MY EYE.

1347
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
STATE POLICE OF CONNECTICUT.

1348
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
WRAPPED AROUND A TEDDY BEAR.

1349
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN SO

1350
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
WONDERFUL AND SO PROFESSIONAL.

1351
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
AND I THINK IT'S AN INDICATION

1352
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
AND STRONG NOD TO THE PEOPLE OF

1353
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
CONNECTICUT, THEY HAVE A LOT TO

1354
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
BE PROUD OF WITH THIS POLICE

1355
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
DEPARTMENT.
YOU SEE THE AREA, IT HAS GROWN

1356
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
BY THE DAY.
THE BALLOONS AND TEDDY BEARS AND

1357
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
THE WREATHS AND FLOWERS.

1358
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
THIS CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE.

1359
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
IT HAS THE NAMES -- IT'S SMALL

1360
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
JUST LIKE A CHILD AT THAT AGE.

1361
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
THERE IS CHASE THIS IS DAWN

1362
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
HOCHSTRUNG.

1363
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
AND EMILIE PARKER WHOSE FATHER

1364
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
CAME OUT SATURDAY NIGHT AND HAD

1365
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
SUCH A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO HIS

1366
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
DAUGHTER.

1367
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
THIS IS THE CENTER OF SANDY HOOK

1368
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
FOREVER TO BE REMEMBERED WITH

1369
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS.

1370
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT US.

1371
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
FOREVER.

1372
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
THIS IS A LOCAL NEWSPAPER FROM

1373
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
DANBURY CALLED "THE NEWS TIMES."

1374
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
IT HAS A PICTURE OF THE

1375
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
PRESIDENT.
"TEACH THEM WELL" IN QUOTES.

1376
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
YOU SEE THE BLACK BANNER OF 27

1377
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000

1379
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
ADAM LANZA, THE KILLER, AGE 20.

1380
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
MORE IN A MOMENT.

1381
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
WE EXPECT A BRIEFING AGAIN

1382
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
SHORTLY.

1383
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION.

1384
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE GOING TO

1385
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
TALK TO LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE.

1386
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
MY APOLOGIES.

1387
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1388
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
WE'LL TRY AND PUSH THIS STORY

1389
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
FORWARD.
MARTHA: YOU MAKE SUCH A GOOD

1390
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
POINT ABOUT THE TROOPERS THERE

1391
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
AND LIEUTENANT VANCE HAS BEEN SO

1392
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
REMARKABLE, WHAT REAL BACKBONE

1393
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
FOR THIS TOWN.

1394
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
IT'S STRANGE TO SEE THAT

1395
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
COMBINATION WHERE THERE SHOULD

1396
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
BE CHRISTMAS GIFT TO SEE THE

1397
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
JUXTAPOSITION OF THE MOURNING OF

1398
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
THE NAMES OF THE YOUNG CHILDREN,

1399
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
SO MANY OF WHOM WERE LOOKING

1400
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
FORWARD TO CHRISTMAS WITH THEIR

1401
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
FAMILIES.
WE MOURN THE LOSS OF THOSE YOUNG

1402
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
CHILDREN AND ALL OF THE VICTIMS

1403
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
AND WE ARE REMEMBERING SOME OF

1404
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
THE HEROES WHO DIED PROTECTING

1405
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
OTHERS.

1406
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
THE ORNAMENTS EVEN MORE ON THOSE

1407
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
TREES.

1408
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS THE

1409
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
PRINCIPAL OF SANDY HOOK

1410
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
ELEMENTARY.

1411
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS SHE LUNGED OUT

1412
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
INTO THE HALLWAY AREA AND TOOK

1413
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
ON THE KILLER TO TRY TO STOP HIM

1414
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE INITIAL

1415
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
CASUALTIES OF THIS HORRIFIC

1416
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
CRIME.
SHE IS CREDITED WITH ALERTED

1417
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
CLASSES BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED

1418
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
AND FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO NEARLY

1419
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
WALKED INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.

1420
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
SHE WAS ABLE TO PROTECT THEM AS

1421
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
WELL.
COLLEAGUES SAY SHE TREATED

1422
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
EVERYBODY IN THAT SCHOOL AS

1423
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
FAMILY.
>> JUST LIKE HER STUDENT.

1424
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
SHE CARED FOR HER FAMILY.

1425
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE FAMILY.

1426
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
SHE WAS A GREAT MOTHER,

1427
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
STEPMOTHER, A WIFE.

1428
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
HER FAMILY LIVED IN OUR TOWN.

1429
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY.

1430
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
WE WOULD SEE EACH OTHER IN THE

1431
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
GROCERY STORE.

1432
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I CONTINUALLY ASKED HER TO COME

1433
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
BACK TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT

1434
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
SHE WAS HAPPY MOVING FORWARD

1435
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
WITH HER CAREER.

1436
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
IT'S A GREAT TRAGEDY.

1437
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT

1438
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
TO HER FAMILY.

1439
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
MARTHA: WE HEARD THE POLICE

1440
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
UPDATE.
THE SHOOTER'S AUNT IS RELEASING

1441
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
PERSONAL DETAILS OF THE

1442
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
STRUGGLES HE FACED BEFORE THE

01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
VIE SCHEDULE TOOK PLACE.

1444
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
AND THE PARENTS OF TWO YOUNG

01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
VICTIMS WILL BE THE FIR TO HAVE

1446
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
THE FUNERALS TODAY IN THAT

1447
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
TRAGEDY.
WE'LL DISCUSS THE ROLE OF

1448
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
RELIGION IN AMERICA'S HEALING

1449
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
PROCESS THIS WEEK AS WE TRY TO

1450
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
FIND THE STRENGTH AMID FAITH FOR

1451
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
SUCH DEVASTATING HEARTBREAK.

1452
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
AND AS THE PRESIDENT ISSUES A

1453
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
CALL FOR CHANGE TO COME FROM

1454
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
THIS NATIONAL TRAGEDY WE'LL

1455
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
DEBATE WHAT HE THINKS NEEDS TO

1456
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

1457
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

1458
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
>> I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON

1459
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
THIS.

1460
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES

1461
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
THE ANSWER IS NO.

1462
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

1463
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
AND WE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE.

1464
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
MARTHA: MONDAY MORNING NOW.

1465
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
AMERICANS ARE STILL TRYING

1466
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
TO MAKE SENSE OF THE TRAGEDY

1467
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
THAT UNFOLDED IN NEWTOWN

1468
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
LAST WEEK, IF SUCH A THING

1469
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
COULD REALLY EVER HAPPEN.

1470
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
WE'RE GETTING A BETTER

1471
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
PICTURE OF SOME OF THE

1472
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
PERSONAL ISSUES THAT PLAGUED

1473
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
THIS SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

1474
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

1475
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
WATCHED HIS PARENTS

1476
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
STRUGGLES WITH THEIR

1477
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
TROUBLED SON.

1478
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
>> I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES

1479
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
WITH SCHOOL.

1480
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
SHE MENTIONED SHE WOUND UP

1481
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
HOMESCHOOLING HIM.

1482
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
SHE BATTLED WITH THE SCHOOL

1483
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
DISTRICT.
IN WHAT CAPACITY I'M NOT

1484
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
100% CERTAIN.

1485
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
IF IT WAS BEHAVIOR OR

1486
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
LEARNING DISABILITIES, I

1487
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS VERY, VERY BRIGHT

1488
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
BOY.

1489
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
IF SHE.

1490
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
THEY WERE TYPE OF PARENTS

1491
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED AND

1492
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
SEPARATE LATED IF KIDS HAD A

1493
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
NEED THIS WOULD DEFINITELY

1494
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
FILL IT.

1495
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
MARTHA: BOY, SO MUCH

1496
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
CONFUSION AND JUST TRYING TO

1497
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
UNDERSTAND HOW DO YOU GET TO

1498
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
THIS POINT?

1499
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
HE WAS REPORTEDLY DEVASTATED

1500
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
BY HIS PARENTS DIVORCE BACK

1501
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
IN 2009.

1502
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
HIS FATHER SAYS, QUOTE, WE

1503
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
TWO ARE ASKING WHY, WHY.

1504
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
IMAGINE WHAT HIS FAMILY IS

1505
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
GOING THROUGH AS WELL

1506
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
BECAUSE, WE'VE HEARD THAT

1507
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
EVEN, FROM ONE OF THE LITTLE

1508
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
GIRL, EMILY PARKER'S DAD

1509
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
SAID HE FELT SYMPATHY FOR

1510
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER.

1511
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
EVERYBODY OFFERING

1512
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
CONDOLENCE ARES TO THE

1513
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
FAMILIES OF THOSE LOST LOVED

1514
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
ONES AND INSURED AS WELL.

1515
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA USED HIS

1516
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
SPEECH AT LAST NIGHT'S

1517
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
PRAYER VIGIL IN NEWTOWN,

1518
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
CONNECTICUT, TO COMFORT A

1519
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
SHATTERED COMMUNITY AND

1520
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
GRIEF-STRICKEN NATION AND TO

1521
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
CALL FOR CHANGE AS A RESULT.

1522
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
>> WE JUST CAN'T TOLERATE

1523
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
THIS ANYMORE.

1524
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

1525
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
AND TO END THEM WE MUST

1526
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
CHANGE.

1527
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE

1528
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
CAUSES OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE

1529
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
COMPLEX AND THAT IS TRUE.

1530
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF

1531
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
LAWS CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM

1532
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
THE WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY

1533
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE IN

1534
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
OUR SOCIETY.

1535
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE A AN

1536
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
EXCUSE FOR INACTION.

1537
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
MARTHA: SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE

1538
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
DONE?
THE PRESIDENT RAISES AN

1539
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT QUESTION

1540
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
HERE.
IT IS WORTH TALKING ABOUT

1541
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
AND REFLECTING ON THIS

1542
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
MORNING.
WE ARE GLAD TO DO THAT THIS

1543
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
MORNING WITH KIRSTEN POWERS,

1544
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
"DAILY BEAST" COLUMNIST AND

1545
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND

1546
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
TONY SAYING, FORMER PRESS

1547
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
AIDE TO GOP

1548
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE

1549
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
AND JACK KEMP AND RADIO NEWS

1550
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
SERVICE.

1551
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU.

1552
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
AS WE TRY TO SHAKE OFF SO

1553
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
TOM EXTENT AND MAKE REAL

1554
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
ASSESSMENTS ABOUT IT.

1555
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
YOU BOTH GREW UP ROUGHLY

1556
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
WHEN I DID.
WE HAD FIRE DRILLS ONCE IN A

1557
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
WHILE.

1558
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
MY CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL, WE

1559
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
TALKED OVER THE WEEKEND.

1560
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
THEY SAID OH, YEAH WE HAVE

1561
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

1562
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
DRILLS WE DO.

1563
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
ONCE A MONTH DO ROTATING

1564
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
DRILL.
ONE TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM

1565
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
THE SCHOOL AS POSSIBLE.

1566
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
IN THE OTHER WE'RE SUPPOSED

1567
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
TO BARRICADE OURSELVES INTO

1568
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
A ROOM.
THEY GO THROUGH THE RITUALS,

1569
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
TONY, ON A REGULAR BASIS AS

1570
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
KIDS DO ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

1571
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
YOU HAVE SCHOOLS SAYING

1572
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
WE'RE BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL

1573
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
SECURITY.

1574
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
WE DIDN'T GROW UP LIKE THIS.

1575
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1576
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
>> MARTHA, I THINK WE'RE SO

1577
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
UNITED RIGHT NOW OVER THIS

1578
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
TRAGEDY WHICH AFFECTS

1579
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
ANYBODY.
ANY PERSON WITH A HEART BEAT

1580
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
IN AMERICA SUFFERS FOR THE

1581
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
FAMILIES AND LOST PEOPLE AND

1582
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN

1583
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
MASSACRE AND I THINK WE

1584
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
SHOULD SEIZE THIS MOMENT TO

1585
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
TRY TO WORK TOGETHER, WE'RE

1586
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS

1587
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
PROBLEM BUT WE COULD ADDRESS

1588
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT.

1589
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
BECAUSE ONE MAD MEN OR

1590
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
SOCIOPATH OR DERANGED PERSON

1591
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
WILL NEVER CONFORM OR SUBMIT

1592
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
TO RATIONAL LAW.

1593
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
TO THE PRESIDENT'S POINT,

1594
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T

1595
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
TRY TO DO SOMETHING.

1596
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
ONE.

1597
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
IDEAS COME OUT IN THE WAKE

1598
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
OF THIS, YOU DISCUSSED IT

1599
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
WITH SENATOR LIEBERMAN, IS

1600
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
THIS COMMISSION ON VIOLENCE

1601
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
BECAUSE VIOLENCE IS SUCH A

1602
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
MULTIDIMENSIONAL COMPLEX

1603
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
ISSUE.

1604
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
IT COMES PARTS OF THE

1605
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

1606
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
COMES FROM THE BREAKDOWN

1607
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
PERHAPS IN PEOPLE'S

1608
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
FAMILIES.

1609
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
BULLYING.

1610
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
COMES FROM THE LACK OF FAITH

1611
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I THINK.

1612
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
THE ADVOCATED IN OUR PARTS

1613
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
OF OUR SOCIETY TODAY.

1614
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
AND GUN CONTROL IS ALSO A

1615
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

1616
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
SO I THINK IF WE'RE ABLE TO

1617
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
GET, MAYBE A GUY LIKE

1618
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
JOE LIEBERMAN TO HEAD UP A

1619
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
COMMISSION WITH A REAL

1620
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
MANDATE TO ADDRESS WAYS

1621
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
GOVERNMENT CAN REALLY

1622
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
PROTECT CHILDREN I THINK WE

1623
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
SHOULD PERHAPS START THAT

1624
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
CONVERSATION.
MARTHA: FAMILY, VIOLENCE AND

1625
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
GUNS.

1626
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
THOSE ARE THE THREE WORDS,

1627
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
KIRSTEN.

1628
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY.

1629
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
EXTREME AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE

1630
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
WE LIVE WITH AND SEE IN OUR

1631
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
SOCIETY.

1632
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
THESE ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT

1633
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
ARE WAR WEAPONS, THAT ARE

1634
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
PART OF THE CULTURE AS WELL,

1635
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
KIRSTEN?

1636
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
>> YEAH.
I MEAN PEOPLE TALK A LOT

1637
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
ABOUT THE ASPECT OF THE

1638
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
HOLLYWOOD AND VIDEOGAMES.

1639
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THE

1640
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
GOVERNMENT CAN DO ABOUT

1641
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
THAT.

1642
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND

1643
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
ADVOCATE PEOPLE DON'T

1644
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
CONSUME THIS.
THERE IS VERY LITTLE WE CAN

1645
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
DO TO STOP PEOPLE PUTTING IT

1646
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
OUT.
THE TWO PLACES WHERE

1647
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
GOVERNMENT CAN DO SOMETHING

1648
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE.

1649
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
PROVIDING SUPPORT TO

1650
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
PARENTS.

1651
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
A LOT OF PARENTS WHO FACE

1652
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
WHAT THE MOTHER OF THIS

1653
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
SHOOTER, THIS KILLER FACED

1654
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
WHICH IS MENTALLY ILL

1655
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
CHILDREN AND THERE AREN'T A

1656
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
LOT OF RESOURCES TO DEAL

1657
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
WITH THEM.

1658
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE

1659
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
SOMEONE COMMITTED WHO THEY

1660
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
THINK IT IS DANGEROUS IT IS

1661
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
VERY DIFFICULT.

1662
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
SO THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE

1663
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
LOOKED AT.

1664
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
GUN CONTROL NEEDS TO BE

1665
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000

1666
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000

1667
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
PERSON MAY GO OUT AND DO

1668
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000

1671
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
A LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO

1672
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
CAUSE THE KIND OF CARNAGE WE

1673
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000

WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND

1674
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
LOOK AT SOME KIND OF

1675
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000

1676
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000

ISSUE OF INSTITUTIONALIZING

1680
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
AND WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT.

1681
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
ARE THERE TIMES WHEN THAT IS

1682
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
APPROPRIATE ACTION T TAKE

1683
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000

1834
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000

1842
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
THE SHOCK AND GRIEF IS IN

1843
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
THERE.

1844
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
WHAT, WE'VE HAD TO ENDURE

1845
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
HERE IS UNIMAGINABLE.

1846
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THESE

1847
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
FAMILIES AND RIGHT NOW

1848
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
THAT'S ALL WE'RE THINKING

1849
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
ABOUT.

1850
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
BILL: I TALKED TO MANY

1851
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
PEOPLE IN TOWN AND THEY HAVE

1852
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
TOLD ME EVERYBODY KNEW ADAM

1853
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
LANZA.
HE WAS THE AWKWARD GUY WHO

1854
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
ALWAYS STUCK OUT AND NO ONE

1855
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
REALLY HAD AN IDEA ABOUT HOW

1856
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
TO RELATE TO HIM.

1857
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
WERE YOU AWARE OF HIM?

1858
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
>> I HAVE NO DIRECT DEALINGS

1859
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
WITH HIM.

1860
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT

1861
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
OF REPORTS ON HIM, AS FAR AS

1862
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

1863
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
SO --.

1864
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
BILL: CRIMINAL SENSE HE HAS

1865
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
NO RECORD.

1866
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
SO THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

1867
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
>> HE IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS

1868
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
THAT JUST, KIND OF FLEW

1869
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
UNDER THE RADAR A LITTLE.

1870
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
BILL: REALLY?

1871
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
UNDER THE RADAR?

1872
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
>> TRAGEDY.

1873
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
BILL: YOU'RE GOING TO BRIEF

1874
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON, I

1875
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
THINK AT 12 NOON.

1876
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
YOU'VE BEEN VERY CAREFUL

1877
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

1878
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
INFORMATION YOU HAVE MADE

1879
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
PUBLIC.
>> YES, SIR.

1880
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
BILL: WHAT IS THE PROCESS

1881
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
FOR YOU ABOUT IN TRYING TO

1882
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
KEEP THINGS ACCURATE?

1883
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
KNOWING WHEN YOU CONSIDER

1884
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
THE FIRST 36 HOURS THERE HAS

1885
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION

1886
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
OUT THERE THAT'S BEEN PULLED

1887
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
BACK.
>> IT IS IMPORTANT WE ARE

01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000

DISSEMINATE INFORMATION TO

EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON BUT

1893
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES

1894
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
WE NEED TO KEEP THE CARDS

1895
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000

WE DON'T WANT ANY MISLEADING

1900
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000

01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
THE FAMILY MAKEUP.

1918
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
THE HISTORY.

01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
SHOOTING.

1970
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
THEY TURN TO RELIGION, FAITH,

1971
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
SOME SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING

1972
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

1973
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
THEY TRY TO FIND SOME SORT

1974
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
OF HOPE IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL

1975
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000

WE WILL GET BETTER

1979
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
MARTHA: WE GOT THE ANSWER TO A

1980
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
BURNING POLITICAL QUESTION THIS

1981
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
MORNING, AND THAT WAS WHO WILL

1982
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
BE THE NEXT SENATOR FROM SOUTH

1983
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000

1984
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000

01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
GENTLEMAN, REPRESENTATIVE TIM

1988
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000

HE WAS APPOINTED BY NIKKI HALEY,

1989
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
AT HER DISCRETION IT WAS HER

ABILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION AS

1991
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.

1992
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
IT LOOKS HOW THAT AFFECTS THE

1993
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
POLITICAL PICTURE IN THE

1994
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000

NEW ATTACKS BEING LAUNCHED IN

2000
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
THE TOWN OF DARAH AS BATTLES

2001
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
RAGE ON AT A REFUGEE CAMP IN

2002
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
DAMASCUS.
THEY SAY THE ARMY CANNOT DEFEAT

2003
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
THE REBELS SEEKING TO TOP THE

2004
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
PRESIDENT'S REGIME.

2005
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

2006
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
LELAND VITTERT JOINS US LIVE

2007
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
FROM JERUSALEM WHERE HE IS

2008
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
WATCHING THE STORY UNFOLD.

2009
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT

2010
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
STATEMENT BY THE VICE

2011
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
PRESIDENT?
>> Reporter: IN MANY WAYS,

01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
MARTHA IT IS THE STATEMENT OF

01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
THE OBVIOUS.

2014
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT IS WHO IS

2015
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
SAYING IT.
THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF

2016
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT

2017
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD LOOKING TO

01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000

HIMSELF OR FOR A LARGER GROUP OF

2020
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
THE BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME.

2021
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
IT IS BOOKING INCREASINGLY CLEAR

2022
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
AS WE ARE WATCHING THE BATTLES

2023
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO

2024
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
DAMASCUS THAT THE REBELS ARE

2025
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
STARTING AT LOWE'S TO GAIN THE

2026
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
UPPER HAND.
THEY ARE GETTING WEAPONS FROM A

2027
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
NUMBER OF GULF COUNTRIES, THEY

2028
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
ARE BECOMING BETTER TRAINED AND

2029
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
ORGANIZED.

2030
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
THEY'VE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT

2031
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
VICTORIES HERE IN THE PAST AND

2032
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
THE GOVERNMENT FORCES CONTINUE

2033
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
TO FALL APART IN LARGE PART,

2034
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
ALTHOUGH THE CIVIL WAR IS STILL

2035
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
RAGING ON, MANY SAY NEITHER SIDE

2036
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN.

2037
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
THE QUESTION IS HAS PRESIDENT

2038
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
R-R BASHAR AL-ASSAD OR IN THIS

2039
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
MATTER THE VICE PRESIDENT BEGUN

2040
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
TO LOOK FOR A WAY OUT, WITH SO

2041
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
GRAND NEGOTIATIONS.

2042
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
THAT'S WHAT THE VICE PRESIDENT

2043
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
TALKED ABOUT IN HIS INTERVIEW

2044
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
WITH A LEBANESE NEWSPAPER

2045
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
THERE.
THIS CONTINUES AS THE VIOLENCE

2046
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
IS NOT ONLY GOING BETWEEN THE

2047
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
REBELS AND OF COURSE THE SYRIAN

2048
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
TROOPS BUT ALSO AFFECTING A

2049
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
NUMBER OF CIVILIANS.

2050
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
SOME OF THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE

2051
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
TO SHOW YOU FROM A PALESTINIAN

2052
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
REFUGEE CAMP WHERE THERE HAS

2053
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
BEEN ONGOING FIGHTING AND A

2054
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
RECENT ATTACK BY GOVERNMENT

2055
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
TROOPS IS GRUESOME TO SAY THE

2056
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
LEAST.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SHOTS THAT

2057
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
WE HAD TO EDIT OUT BECAUSE IT

2058
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
GOT SO BAD THERE AT THAT SCENE.

2059
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
THE U.N. HAS STEPPED IN TO TALK

2060
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CIVILIANS

2061
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
WHO ARE NOW IN HARM'S WAY.

2062
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
IT'S BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY

2063
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
DIFFICULT SITUATION TO TELL WHO

2064
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
IS ON WHICH SIDE THERE INSIDE

2065
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR.

2066
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF THOUGHTS,

2067
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
MARTHA THAT EVEN IF PRESIDENT

2068
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND HIS REGIME

2069
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
LEAVE SOME TIME SOON OR IN THE

2070
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
COMING MONTHS THAT MAY BE THE

2071
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
BEGINNING OF A NEW CHAPTER IN

2072
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
THE CIVIL WAR RATHER THAN SOME

2073
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
GRAND PEACE THAT WOULD ALLOW

2074
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
THESE THOUSANDS, IF NOT TENS OF

2075
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF

2076
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
CIVILIANS WHOSE LIVES ARE IN

2077
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
DANGER TO BE BACK SAFELY AT

2078
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
HOME.
MARTHA: WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE

2079
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
CHANGE OF POWER CAN SOMETIMES

2080
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
NOT GO SMOOTHLY.

2081
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2082
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
LET'S GO TO BILL IN NEWTOWN.

2083
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
BILL: WE ARE JUST A FEW HOURS

2084
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000

2085
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
FUNERALS TO BEGIN HERE IN

2086
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
NEWTOWN IN SANDY HOOK,

2087
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE KNOW THE FIRST RESPONDERS

2088
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
POSSIBLY SAVED EVEN MORE LIVES

2089
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
AS HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF

2090
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
AMMUNITION UNUSED WERE FOUND

2091
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

2092
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THAT IS NEXT WHEN WE CONTINUE ON

2093
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
THE TRAGEDY HERE AT SANDY HOOK

2094
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
IN A MOMENT.

2095
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000

2098
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
'CAUSE ALL OUR STATES ARE GREAT.

2099
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
AND NOW IS WHEN THE GULF

2100
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
GETS EVEN BETT.

2101
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
THE BEACHES AND WATERS

2102
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIL.

2103
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE OR
JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

2104
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000

SOOME TO THE GULF,

2107
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
ESPECIALLY IN ALABAMA.

2108
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
YOU MEAN MISSISSIPPI.

2109
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
THAT'S FLORIDA.

2110
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
SAY LOUISIANA OR
THERE'S NO DESSERT.

2111
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,000
BROUGHT TO YOU BY BP AND ALL
OF US WHO CA THE GULF HOME.

2112
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
BILL: WE KNOW THE ATTACK LASTED

2113
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
ONLY TEN MINUTES AND IT WAS THE

2114
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
SIRENS OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS

2115
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
THAT FORCED THE KILLER TO TURN

2116
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
HIS OWN GUNS AND OWN AMMUNITION

2117
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
ON HIMSELF AND TAKE HIS LIFE.

2118
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
BUT THAT WAS AFTER SO MANY YOUNG

2119
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
LIVES WERE TAKEN FROM US.

2120
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
WE ARE AT THE END OF THE ROAD

2121
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE FIRE

2122
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
HOUSE HERE WHERE SO MANY DOZENS

2123
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
AND DOZENS, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF

2124
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
YOUNG CHILDREN FROM KINDERGARTEN

2125
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
TO AGE FOUR AROUND THIS TIME,

2126
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
THREE DAYS AGO, CAME HERE TO GET

2127
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
AWAY FROM THE CARNAGE THEY HAD

2128
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
JUST LEFT AND TO MEET THEIR

2129
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
MOTHERS AND THEIR FATHERS WHO

2130
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
CAME TO FIND THEM AND BRING THEM

2131
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
HOME.

2132
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
IF YOU GO DOWN THE ROAD HERE

2133
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
ABOUT A HALF MILE YOU WILL FIND

2134
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
THE ONLY TRAFFIC LIGHT IN THIS

2135
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
TINY, WONDERFUL TOWN.

2136
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
WE WERE THERE A SHORT TIME AGO.

2137
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
THE STATE TROOPERS THAT ARE SET

2138
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
UP AT THAT INTERSECTION PREVENT

2139
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
A LOT OF TRAFFIC FRANKLY FROM

2140
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
MOVING DOWN THAT ROAD.

2141
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
IF YOU WENT DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT

2142
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
500 YARDS YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT

2143
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

2144
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
SCHOOL.
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE

2145
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
OF SANDY HOOK.

2146
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
IT'S BEEN INVADED BY, FRANKLY SO

2147
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
MUCH MEDIA AND TRAFFIC EVEN AT

2148
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
7:30 IN THE MORNING.

2149
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE IN DECEMBER WITH

2150
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
THE SNOWFALL HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS

2151
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
VILLAGE IS WITH A RIVER THAT

2152
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
CUTS RIGHT THROUGH TOWN, AND THE

2153
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
SIGNS NOW THAT ARE SET UP, ONE

2154
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000

2155
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000

2157
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000

HOURS FROM NOW.

2161
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
MARTHA, I HAVE LEARNED THAT ONE

2162
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
OF THE FIRST POLICE OFFICERS ON

2163
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
THE SCENE IS ABOUT 25 YEARS OLD,

2164
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
HE HASN'T SPOKEN PUBLICLY YET.

2165
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
HE'S A U.S. MARINE, A VETERAN

2166
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
FROM THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, AND

2167
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
WHAT HE SAW INSIDE THAT SCHOOL

2168
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
FAR ECLIPSESS ANYTHING HE CAME

2169
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
ACROSS IN THE WAR ON TERROR

2170
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
OVERSEAS IN THE DESERTS AND

2171
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN.

2172
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
BACK TO YOU.

2173
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
MARTHA: IT'S GOING TO BE VERY
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE FIRST

2174
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
RESPONDERS TO THAT SCENE TO

2175
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
EVER -- THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE

2176
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
TO GET THOSE IMAGES OUT OF THEIR

2177
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
MINDS AND EVERYBODY WILL TRY TO

2178
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
MOVE FORWARD IN SOME WAY, SHAPE

2179
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
OR FORM, BILL.

2180
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2181
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
BACK HERE IN NEW YORK WE WANT TO

2182
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THIS STORY

2183
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
THIS MORNING, SECRETARY OF STATE

2184
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS SAID TO BE AT

2185
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
HOME RECOVERING FROM A

2186
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
CONCUSSION TODAY AFTER A FALL

2187
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
THAT SHE SUSTAINED WHEN SHE

2188
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
FAINTED DUE TO A STOMACH VIRUS.

2189
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED

2190
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
ALL OF THIS OVER THE WEEKEND.

2191
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
WE WERE AWAITING THE RESULTS OF

2192
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE

2193
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
TERROR ATTACK IN BENGHAZI.

2194
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
THE DETAILS OF WHICH EVERYBODY

2195
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
LOOKS FORWARD TO LEARNING, AND

2196
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
MANY HAD HOPED WOULD ARRIVE

2197
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

2198
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
NOW WE ARE LEARNING THAT

2199
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
MRS. CLINTON WILL NOT TESTIFY

2200
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
BEFORE THE HOUSE AND SENATE

2201
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
PANELS ON THURSDAY AS WAS

2202
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
EXPECTED ABOUT THAT DEADLY

>> TO REALLY FIND OUT WHAT

2207
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
HAPPENED ULTIMATELY I BELIEVE

2208
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
SECRETARY CLINTON WILL HAVE TO

2209
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
TESTIFY.

2210
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR

2211
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
SECRETARY CLINTON AND NO ONE

2212
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN

2213
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
SHE WOULD AND NO ONE WOULD BE IN

2214
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
A POSITION REALLY TO ANSWER THE

2215
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
TOUGH QUESTIONS MORE THAN

2216
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
SECRETARY CLINTON.

2217
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
ONCE SHE RECOVERS I THINK IT'S

2218
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
IMPORTANT SHE TESTIFY.

2219
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
>> JOHNNY ISAACSON JOINS ME, A

2220
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000

2221
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE HEARING

2222
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
THIS TESTIMONY.

2223
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
GOOD MORNING, GOOD TO HAVE YOU

MARTHA

2228
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
MARTHA: WE HEARD LAST WEEK THAT

2229
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
SHE CANCELED A TRIP BECAUSE OF A

2230
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
STOMACH VIRUS.

2231
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FACT

2232
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
THAT SHE WILL NOT TESTIFY AND IN

2233
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
HER PLACE WE WILL HEAR FROM

2234
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
OFFICIALS WILLIAM BURNS AND

2235
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
THOMAS NEADS.

2236
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
>> WE HOPE THE SECRETARY

2237
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
RECOVERS SOON, CONCUSSIONS CAN

2238
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
BE BAD.

2239
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
EVENTUALLY I THINK THE SECRETARY

2240
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
OF STATE SHOULD TESTIFY.

2241
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
SECRETARY BURNS IS A VERY

2242
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
COMPETENT INDIVIDUAL BUT THIS IS

2243
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
A TRAGIC LOSS OF A U.S.

2244
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
AMBASSADOR, THE FIRST LOSS OF AN

2245
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
AMBASSADOR SINCE 1979, OBVIOUS

2246
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
BREAK DOWNS IN SECURITY.

2247
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FIND OUT

2248
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
ANSWERS TO ALL THE QUESTIONS AND

2249
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
MAKE SURE WE DRAW THE LINE SO IT

2250
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

2251
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
MARTHA: THE COMMITTEE WILL HEAR

2252
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
WE UNDERSTAND FROM FORMER

2253
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING AND

2254
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
RETIRED ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN THE

2255
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF.

2256
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
THE ONE LINK WE DON'T HAVE STILL

2257
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
IS THE ADMINISTRATION, THE WHITE

2258
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
HOUSE, IN TERMS OF THE REQUESTS

2259
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
THAT WE KNOW CAME THROUGH FROM

2260
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
AMBASSADOR CHRIS STEVENS FOR

2261
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
MORE SECURITY IN BENGHAZI.

2262
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THE BIG HOLES

2263
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
IN THE STORY THAT YOU BELIEVE

2264
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
NEED TO BE FILLED IN BY SOMEBODY

2265
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
WHO WOULD BE PRIVY TO ALL THAT

2266
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
INFORMATION?
>> WELL, YOU JUST HIT THE HEART

2267
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
OF THE STORY AND THAT IS WHY THE

2268
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
ADMINISTRATION WOULD PUT SUSAN

2269
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
RICE ON THE POINT OF THE SPEAR

2270
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE ATTACKS

2271
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
WITH INFORMATION THAT I DON'T

2272
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
THINK THEY BELIEVED TO BE

2273
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
TOTALLY KREFPBLGT AND NOW WE

2274
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
KNOW IT'S NOT CORRECT AT ALL.

2275
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

2276
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
REASON THE SECRETARY SHOULD

2277
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
TESTIFY, AND WE OWE THE AMERICAN

2278
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000

2298
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
IT RAISES A QUESTION WHETHER OR

01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
NOT WE'LL EVER KNOW WHAT SHE

2300
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
KNOWS ABOUT THIS SITUATION.

2383
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
SIX BOTH OF THEM.

FATHER JOHN NAN MORRIS IS A FOX

2385
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,000
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

AND AUTHOR SPIRROW JOINS US

2387
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
ALSO.

2388
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF WHY, YOU

2389
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
CAN TRY AND FIGURE OUT ANSWERS,

2390
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
WHETHER IT'S GUN VIOLENCE, OR

2391
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
WHETHER IT'S VIDEO GAMES -RBLGS

2392
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,000
O, MOVIES, MENTAL HEALTH,

2393
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PARENT

2394
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
AND CHILD.

2395
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
PUT ALL OF THAT ASIDE AND LOOK

2396
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
AT IT IN A SIMPLER WAY, THERE

2397
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
ARE TWO FORCES IN THIS WORLD.

2398
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
ONE IS GOOD AND ONE IS EVIL.

2399
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
LUCKILY THE GOOD USUALLY WINS,

2400
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
BUT IN THIS CASE THE EVIL WON

2401
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
OUT.

2402
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
>> I THINK YOU'RE ONTO

2403
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
SOMETHING.
AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T SAY

2404
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
THE DEVIL MADE HIM DO IT,

2405
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
RIGHT?
IN WALKING THROUGH THIS FIRE OUT

2406
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
AND BEING WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE

2407
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000

01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
GOING TO BE BETTER, WE ARE GOING

2410
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
TO BE BETTER.

2411
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I THINK WHAT YOU SAID, BILL, YES

2412
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
WE HAVE FORCES OF EVIL IN OUR

2413
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
OWN LIVES, WE HAVE FORCES OF

2414
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
GOOD.
IT'S TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

2415
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
LOVE.

2416
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
IT JUST DOESN'T TAKE A VILLAGE

2417
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
IT TAKES EVERYONE IN THAT

2418
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
VILLAGE.
BILL: LET ME GET THE RABBI IN

2419
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
HERE.
ONCE THEY THEY GET THE GOOD IS

2420
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
ARGUE WITH THE GOOD AND MAKE THE

2421
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
GOOD GO AGAINST THE GOOD.

2422
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
HOW DO WE GO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING

2423
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
THAT IN YOUR VIEW.

2424
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
>> WHEN WE HAVE THESE EVENTS,

2425
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
WHAT THEY ARE REALLY ARE JOLTS,

2426
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
NATIONAL JOLTS THAT SHOULD

2427
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
CATAPULT US TO AN UNDERSTANDING

2428
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
OF THE VULNERABILITY OF LIFE BUT

2429
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
THEREFORE THE SERIOUSNESS IN

2430
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
WHICH WE HAVE A APPROACH LIFE

2431
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000

2433
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000

COUNTRY THERE IS SOMETHING EVIL

2439
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
CANNOT DEFEAT AND THAT IS THE

2440
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
WONDERFUL SPIRIT OF MAN TO SEE
