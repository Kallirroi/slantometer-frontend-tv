OR MENTAL DISORDER WHICH

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
THE MURDEROUS RAMPAGE.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
BUT AT THIS POINT POLICE ARE

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000

GETTING UNDERWAY.
WE EXPECT THE ISSUE OF GUN

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
VIOLENCE MAY COME UP.

52
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
IT HAS IN THE PAST COUPLE

53
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
DAYS.

SUNDAY NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
SAID THIS WAS THE 4th TIME

56
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IN HIS PRESIDENCY THAT A

57
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TORN

58
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
APART BY A MASS SHOOTING.

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
HE PROMISED TO DO EVERYTHING

60
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
IN HIS POWER TO PREVENT

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
SEVERAL REPORTERS PRESSED

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
THE PRESS SECRETARY JAY
CARNEY ON THIS ISSUE, ASKING

64
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
DONE MORE TO TAKE THE LEAD

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
ON THIS ISSUE?

67
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
>> IN THE OCTOBER

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE THE

69
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
PRESIDENT SAID ONE OF THE

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
DEBATES, WEAPONS THAT WERE

71
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
DESIGNED FOR SOLDIERS IN WAR

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
THEATERS DON'T BELONG ON OUR

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
STREETS.

74
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
CAN YOU NAME ONE THING THE

75
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN THE

76
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
LAST FOUR YEARS TO HELP

77
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
REMOVE WEAPONS OF WAR FROM
OUR STREETS?

78
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO

79
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
QUESTION, JAKE, THAT THE

80
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SCOURGE OF GUN VIOLENCE IS A

81
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT

82
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SUFFICIENTLY BEEN ADDRESSED

83
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
BECAUSE, AS WE SAW IN FEW

84
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
DOWN, WE CONTINUED TO -- NEW

85
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TRAGEDIES THAT HURT INNOCENT

87
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
VICTIMS.
THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS THE

88
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AND

89
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
REINSTATEMENT.
>> ONE MEASURE, ONE ACT, ONE

90
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TO REMOVE THE WEAPONS OF WAR

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THAT HE TALKS ABOUT?

92
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> AGAIN HE SUPPORTS

93
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
LEGISLATION THAT IS DESIGNED

94
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
TO BAN SOME WEAPONS BUT AS

95
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000

>> THANK YOU, MEGYN.

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
MEGYN: THE REPORTER FROM ABC

102
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
NEWS JAKE TAPPER ASKING FOR

103
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ONE, NAME ONE THING.

104
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
PRESIDENT, AND YOU KNOW, YOU

106
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
COULD HEAR JAY CARNEY OTHER

107
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THAN SORT OF SPEAKING ABOUT

108
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SOME THEORETICAL SUPPORT FOR

109
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A RENEWED ASSAULT WEAPONS

110
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BAN COULD NOT POINT TO ONE.

111
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THIS IS SOMETHING HE HAS

112
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TAKEN CONSIDERABLE FLAK FROM

113
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THE LEFT ON BECAUSE THEY

114
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
LIKE THIS ASSAULT WEAPONS

115
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
BAN THAT WAS IN PLACE FROM

116
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
'94 TO 2004.

117
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN A

118
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
LOT OF RHETORIC ABOUT THIS

119
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BAN.
NOW THE QUESTIONS ARE

120
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
INCREASING ABOUT WHAT ACTION,

121
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
IF ANY HE IS WILLING TO

122
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
TAKE.
ARE THE MEDIA, ARE THEY

123
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS

124
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ANSWERS WE GOT FROM

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
MR. CARNEY?
>> THEY'RE INTERESTING

127
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
QUESTIONS, THAT'S FOR SURE,

128
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
MEGYN AND IN TERMS OF THE

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
RESPONSES WE SAW FROM THE

130
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

131
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
YESTERDAY AND IN RECENT DAYS

132
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I THINK IT REALLY DOES COME

133
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
DOWN TO TWO POINTS.

134
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
ONE IS POLITICS AND THE

135
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
OTHER IS PRACTICAL REALITY.

136
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

137
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
STIPULATE OF COURSE THE

138
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
PRESIDENT ABHORES THESE

139
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
TYPES OF HEINOUS AND

140
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HORRIFIC ACTS.

141
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WE ALL DO.

142
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
WE'RE ALL MOURNING AND JUST

143
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
HORRIFIED WHAT WE SAW.

144
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE

145
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE

146
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
AFTERMATH HE SORT OF HAD TO

147
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
COMPOSE HIMSELF.

148
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS.

149
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

150
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
NATION COMES TOGETHER TO

151
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
MOURN OVER BUT AT THE END OF

152
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THE DAY HE IS STILL THE

153
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES AND POLITICS IS

154
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES

155
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SOMETHING PRIORITIZING AND

156
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN

157
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
WORDS.

158
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
JAY CARNEY IN A LATER CLIP

159
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
YOU DIDN'T PLAY, TO RANK THE

160
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
PRIORITIES.
IS THIS A TOP PRIORITY?

161
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
BIEL NOT TRY TO RANK THOSE

162
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PRIORITIES.
THE FACT IS WE'VE SEEN THE

163
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
PRESIDENT GO FULL-COURT

164
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
PRESS ON STIMULUS, OBAMACARE,

165
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
NOW TAX HIKES.

166
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THEY HAVE TO SORT OF DRAW

167
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SOME LINES IN THE SAND AND

168
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
PICK THEIR SPOTS AND IT

169
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
APPEARS THIS IS NOT

170
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SOMETHING THAT IS TRUTH BE

171
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TOLD AT THE VERY TOP OF

172
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THEIR LIST.
MEGYN: SOME IN THE WAKE OF

173
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THE TRAGEDY WE SAW ON FRIDAY

174
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
AND NOT JUST THAT ONE BUT

175
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE ONES WE'VE SEEN IN

176
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
RECENT WEEKS, HAVE DECIDED

177
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
TO TAKE AIM AT FOLKS ON THE

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
RIGHT WHO DO NOT SUPPORT A

179
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
RENEWED ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.

180
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHO BELIEVE IN MORE ROBUST

181
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS.

182
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
AND TAKE ISSUE WITH THEIR

183
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
POSITION.

184
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
YOU KNOW SAYING SOMEHOW THEY

185
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HAD A HAND IN THIS.

186
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
SOMEHOW THEY SHOULD FEEL

187
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT

188
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
HAPPENED.
>> YEAH.

189
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
MEGYN: BUT THE PRESIDENT

190
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
APPEARS TO BE ON THE SAME

191
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
PAGE IN TERMS OF ACTIONS

192
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
WITH THOSE VERY PEOPLE.

193
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
HE RAN FOR OFFICE HE SAID HE

194
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WAS GOING TO SUPPORT, HE WAS

195
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
GOING TO PRESS FOR AN

196
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.

197
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
YOU SAW JAKE TAPPER TRYING

198
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
TO GET AT, WELL, WHAT

199
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
SPECIFICALLY HAS HE DONE?

200
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
NAME ONE THING HE HAS DONE?

201
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
BECAUSE EVEN THE LEFT HAS

202
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
BEEN SAYING SINCE HE TOOK

203
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
OFFICE WHERE IS THE

204
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
LEADERSHIP BEEN ON THAT?

205
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
>> YEAH.

206
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I THINK SOME OF THE

207
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
FINGERPOINTING THAT YOU

208
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
DESCRIBE, MEGYN, IS REALLY

209
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
UNFORTUNATE.
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

210
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
CLAMORING LOUDEST FOR

211
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SO-CALLED NATIONAL

212
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS AND
BY THE WAY I THINK IT SHOULD

213
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
REALLY INCLUDE MENTAL

214
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ILLNESS AND A FEW OTHER

215
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
FACTORS HERE BUT IF WE WANT

216
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TO HAVE A NATIONAL

217
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
CONVERSATION POINTING A

218
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
FINGER TRYING TO INDICT HALF

219
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THE COUNTRY YOU SOMEHOW ARE

220
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
COSTICLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

221
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
STUFF LIKE THIS IS VERY

222
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
UNCONSTRUCTIVE WAY TO BEGIN

223
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THAT CONVERSATION.

224
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
MEGYN: IT IS A GOOD WAY TO

225
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
ALIENATE YOUR ADVERSARY,

226
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
YOUR ADVERSARY WHO MAY COME

227
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
OVER TO YOUR SIDE.

228
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WHEN THEY START TO COME OVER

229
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
TO YOUR SIDE YOU SHOULDN'T

230
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
RIDICULE THEM AND BLAME

231
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THEM.
YOU SAID SAY, WELCOME OVER?

232
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
>> WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE

233
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
PRESIDENT IS PRIORITIZING

234
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
HERE, LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINION

235
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
POLLING LAST 40 YEARS,

236
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ESPECIALLY THE LAST COUPLE

237
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
YEARS THE PERCENTAGE OF

238
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PUBLIC SUPPORTS BROAD BASED

239
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
FAR-REACHING GUN CONTROL IS

240
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.

241
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
MEANWHILE GUN OWNERSHIP IS

242
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ALL-TIME HIGH AND VIOLENT

243
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
CRIME IS DOWN.
MEGYN: THAT IS TRUE.

244
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
EVEN RECENT PEW POLL SHOWED

245
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
MORE PEOPLE FAVOR, MORE

246
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
ROBUST GUN RIGHTS THAN THEY

247
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
DO CONSTRICTIONS ON GUN

248
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

249
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IN THE GUN CONTROL CAMP SAY,

250
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IT WOULD HELP IF WE HAD A

251
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LEADER WHO WOULD GIVE US A

252
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
FULL-THROATED ADVOCACY OF

253
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WHY A GUN, MORE GUN

254
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
RESTRICTIONS WOULD HELP.

255
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
>> SURE.

256
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND I THINK, MEGYN, BY AND

257
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
LARGE THE PRESIDENT'S

258
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
REPUTATION AS A PRAGMATIST

259
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IN MY VIEW IS VASTLY

260
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
OVERSTATED BUT I DO WONDER

261
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

262
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
MAYBE IS THERE SOME

263
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PRAGMATISM FROM THE

264
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WHITE HOUSE?
WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT

265
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AND JAY CARNEY THE WORD

266
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
COMPLEX A LOT.

267
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THIS A COMPLEX PROBLEM.

268
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE.

269
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE TO DO

270
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SOMETHING.

271
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT IMPULSE.

272
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SEEING SLAUGHTERED,

273
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
DEFENSELESS CHILDREN.

274
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE A HUMAN

275
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
REACTION THAT WE HAVE TO DO

276
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
SOMETHING BUT THE STANDARD

277
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
AND THE THRESHOLD FOR ACTION

278
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
HAS TO INVOLVE EMPIRICAL

279
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
EVIDENCE AND I WONDER IF THE

280
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WHITE HOUSE REALIZES, ALL

281
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
THESE GUN LAWS TALKED ABOUT

282
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WOULD HAVE SINGLE ONE OF

283
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THEM ACTUALLY PREVENTED THIS

284
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
TRAGEDY?

285
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
IF YOU LOOK AT IT CLEAR EYED,

286
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DO AT

287
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THIS POINT IN TIME THE

288
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
ANSWER IS NO.

289
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THAT IS TOUGH REALITY TO

290
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SORT OF GRAPPLE WITH.

291
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
MEGYN: BECAUSE WE WANT

292
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SOMETHING TO BLAME THAT WE

293
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT.

294
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> RIGHT.

295
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THE FEEL, THE FEELING OF

296
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
DOING SOMETHING.
MEGYN: MENTAL SITUATION NOW.

297
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
BUT HIS MOTHER DID OWN THOSE

298
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
GUNS LEGALLY.

299
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
JUST SEEMS LIKE IF YOU PUT

300
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE, PUT

301
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AS

302
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
YOU SAY.
GUN CONTROL, LET'S LOOK INTO

303
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
IT.
MENTAL HEALTH, LET'S LOOK

304
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
INTO IT.

305
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
VIDEOGAMES, WHATEVER IT IS.

306
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THERE CAN'T BE INSTANT

307
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
JUDGMENT, OH, THEY RAISED

308
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
GUN CONTROL, THEY RAISED

309
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
VIDEOGAMES, OH, THEY RAISED

310
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
MENTAL HEALTH.
PUT IT ON THE TABLE TO HAVE

311
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT IT

312
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
AND LET'S HAVE BOTH SIDES

313
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
REPRESENTED SO WE CAN HEAR

314
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WHAT THE AS YOU SAY THE

315
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
EMPIRICAL FACTS ARE AND NOT

316
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
JUST SPIN FROM PEOPLE THAT

317
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
HAVE AN AGENDA.

318
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
GUY, THANK YOU.

319
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000

ON FRIDAY.

337
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WE'LL TALK TO A MAN WHO

338
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
KNOWS ALL TOO WELL THE

339
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
DANGERS OF GUN VIOLENCE BUT

340
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE, AS

341
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S STILL A

342
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
QUESTION.

343
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>>> AS LAWMAKERS FOCUS ON

344
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
LEGISLATION AFTER NEWTOWN

345
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WE'RE HEARING NEW

346

HEARTWRENCHING STORIES OF

347
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO

348
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
HELPED SURVIVORS IN MOMENTS

349
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
AFTER THE ATTACK INCLUDING

350
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THE SMALLEST CHILDREN.

351
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
ON FRIDAY MORNING GENE ROSEN

352
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
WALKED UP TO HIS HOUSE AND

353
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
DISCOVERED A GROUP OF

354
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
6-YEAR-OLDS PATIENTLY

355
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

358
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE BROUGHT

359
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THEM INSIDE.

360
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
COMFORTED THEM, GIVING SOME

361
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN'S

362
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
STUFFED ANIMALS AND JUICE HE

363
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
LEARNED EXACTLY WHAT THEY

364
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HAD BEEN THROUGH.

365
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000

SAYS THESE YOUNG SURVIVORS

369
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
TAUGHT HIM ABOUT THE TRUE

370
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
MEANING OF STRENGTH IN THE

373
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
DON'T MISS THAT.
THAT IS COMING UP IN A BIT.

382
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
IT AT ONE POINT LOOKED LIKE

383
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A DEAL MIGHT BE CLOSE.

384
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
RIGHT NOW WE'RE HEARING

385
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000

REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT

396
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

397
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
BOEHNER SAYS NEGOTIATIONS
STILL CONTINUE.

398
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THERE IS LOT OF

399
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
COMMUNICATION STILL OPEN.

400
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
HE OFFERED UP WHAT HE SAID

401
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WAS THE B PLAN, THAT WOULD

402
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
BE IN PLACE IF THERE IS NO

403
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ABILITY TO AVOID GOING OVER

404
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF AND THUS

405
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SEEING AFTER THE FIRST OF

406
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE YEAR MASSIVE SPENDING

407
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
CUTS AND HUGE TAX INCREASES

408
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

409
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THROW THE COUNTRY BACK INTO

410
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
RECESSION.

411
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
BOEHNER'S B PLAN IS IGNORE

412
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE SPENDING COME PLONT OF

413
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF PROBLEM AND

414
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
FOCUSING ON TAX CUTS.

415
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WITH THE BELIEF RAISING

416
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
TAXES ON STRUGGLING ECONOMY

417
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
LIKE THIS WOULD BE

418
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
DEVASTATING.
HE OFFERED UP THAT PLAN.

419
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THIS WOULD BE NOT A

420
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
REPLACEMENT OR COUNTEROFFER

421
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
FOR THE BIG DEAL, BUT JUST

422
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IN CASE THEY COULDN'T GET

423
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
ONE.

424
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
WATCH.
>> SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT

425
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

426
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
TALK WITH THE PRESIDENT

427
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
WE'RE GOING TO ALSO MOVE

428
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
PLAN B.

429
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

430
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
EVERY INCOME TAX FILER IN

431
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
AMERICA IS GOING TO PAY A

432
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
HIGHER RATES COME JANUARY

433
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THE 1st UNLESS CONGRESS

434
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ACTS.
SO I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT

435
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
THAT WE PROTECT AS MANY

436
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS AS WE

437
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
CAN.
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

438
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE

439
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS.

440
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> Reporter: SO IN ESSENCE

441
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THE BUSH TAX CUTS WOULD BE

442
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
EXTENDED LEAVING TAX RATES

443
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
AS THEY ARE FOR EVERYBODY

444
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
THAT MAKES UNDER A MILLION

445
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
DOLLARS.

446
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
IT TOOK A NANOSECOND FOR THE

447
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WHITE HOUSE TO JUMP ALL OVER

448
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
IT.
JAY CARNEY SAID HE, MEANING

449
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT WILLING

450
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
TO ACCEPT A DEAL THAT

451
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
DOESN'T ASK ENOUGH OF THE

452
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
VERY WEALTHIEST IN TAXES AND

453
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
INCITY SHIFTS THE BURDEN TO

454
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
MID.
IT DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS

455
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
OUR FISCAL CHALLENGES WITH

456
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
ZERO SPENDING CUTS.

457

SPILLED SOME SENSITIVE

571
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
INTELLIGENCE TO HOLLYWOOD

PENTAGON INVESTIGATION INTO

"ZERO DARK THIRTY", WHICH IS

583
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
ABOUT HOW WE GOT BIN LADEN.

584
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THOSE PENTAGON INVESTIGATORS

585
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
REPORTEDLY CONCLUDED THAT

586
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000

591
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000

INFORMATION TO THE MAKERS OF

593
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THIS FILM AND, AND THAT'S,

594
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THAT PENTAGON INVESTIGATORS

595
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ARE CONCLUDING THAT AND

596
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
REFERRED THE CASE TO THE

597
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
DOJ.
>> YEAH.

598
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
MEGYN: VICKERS AND OTHERS

599
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
BEHIND HIM SAY IF HE DID IT,

600
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
HE DID IT AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S

601
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
DIRECTION.

602
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DON'T POINT THE FINGER AT

603
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
VICKERS.

604
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
MY FAKE WADE ON THIS, AND --

605
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
TAKEAWAY ON THIS AND YOU PUT

606
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
IT INTO PERSPECTIVE,

607
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SOMEBODY LEAKED SOMETHING

608
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE LEAKED
TO THE FILM-MAKERS OF THIS

609
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
MOVIE.

610
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
>> YEAH.

611
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
WE HAVE UNSURFACED SOLID

612
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
EVIDENCE I BELIEVE WHAT WAS

613
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
CHARGED BACK IN AUGUST 2011,

614
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WHEN REPRESENTATIVE PETER

615
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
KING PRESSED THIS ISSUE FOR

616
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.

617
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IT APPEARS MEMBER OF SEAL

618
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
TEAM SIX NAME WAS RELEASED

619
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
TO THE HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS.

620
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THE NAME OF A CURRENTLY

621
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
SERVING SEAL TEAM SIX

622
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
COMMANDER.

623
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
DOESN'T SOUND HE WAS ON THE

624
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
RAID TO BIN LADEN BUT WAS

625
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ABLE TO PROVIDE FIRST-HAND

626
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
ACCOUNTS ABOUT IT.

627
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
VICKERS TALKS ABOUT A COUPLE

628
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
QUOTES PULLED OUT ABOUT IT.

629
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
SOUNDS LIKE ALMOST CASUAL.

630
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I DON'T THINK SOMEONE LIKE

631
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
VICKERS IS LOOKING TO GIVE

632
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
OUT NATIONAL SECURITY

633
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
INFORMATION TO HOLLYWOOD

634
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
PRODUCERS.
LIKE HEAR IS THE NAME OF A

635
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SEAL YOU COULD TALK TO GIVE

636
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU INSIDE INFORMATION.

637
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THAT IS BIG NO, NO.

638
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I UNDERSTAND MAKING FILMS

639
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
ARE ACCURATE.
WE WANT FILMS TO ACCURATELY

640
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
DEPICT HISTORY BUT IF WE'RE

641
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
GIVING OUT CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION IN THE PROCESS,

642
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THAT IS NO GOOD.

643
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
MEGYN: THEY WILL LOOK INTO

644
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THAT AND WE'LL SEE WHAT IF

645
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
ANYTHING COMES FROM IT.

646
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE

647
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IS THIS EMERGING QUESTION

648
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ABOUT WHETHER THE OBAMA

649
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
ADMINISTRATION IS GUILTY OF

650
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THE SAME TACTICS THEY WERE

651
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
CRITICAL OF THE BUSH

652
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
ADMINISTRATION ON, NAMELY,

653
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
WATERBOARDING AND ENHANCED

654
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
INTERROGATION.

655
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THIS MOVIE SEEMS TO SUGGEST

656
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
THAT WE DID ENGAGE IN

657
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
WATERBOARDING IN ORDER TO
GET THE IDENTITY OF THAT

658
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
COURIER WHO WAS BRINGING

659
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THINGS INTO THE BIN LADEN

660
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
COMPOUND AND WHO DID PROVE

661
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
TO BE CRITICAL IN OUR

662
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
ABILITY TO LOCATE BIN LADEN.

663
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
>> YEAH, IT'S A

664
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
HE SAID/SHE SAID BECAUSE NO

665
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
ONE ACTUALLY HAS SEEN THE

666
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FILM AND ONLY A SMALL SUBSET

667
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
HAVE CHARACTERIZED IT.

668
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO THE

669
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
LEFT DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT

670
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THAT ENHANCED INTERROGATION

671
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
WORKS IN ANY WAY OR IN ANY

672
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WAY LED TO THE CAPTURE OF

673
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
BIN LADEN.

674
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THEY'RE LOCKED IN ON THAT.

675
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SO THE FILM HAS TO

676
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
MISREPRESENT HISTORY IF IT

677
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
LEADS A, TO B, TO C, TO

678
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
BIN LADEN.
THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND

679
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ENHANCED INTERROGATION

680
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
TECHNIQUES, WHETHER THEY'RE

681
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
RIGHT OR WRONG, THEY WORK.

682
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AFTER 9/11 THEY WERE USED ON

683
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
A CERTAIN SUBSET, SMALL

684
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
SEGMENT OF DETAINEES TO

685
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
GATHER INFORMATION, SOME OF

686
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
WHICH MAY HAVE LED TO THE

687
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
CAPTURE OF BIN LADEN.

688
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
HOW THE FILM DEPICTS IT I'M

689
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
NOT QUITE SURE.

690
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT YOU

691
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
CAN'T DENY THE FACT THAT

692
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
ENHANCED TEAR GAGS --

693
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
INTERROGATION GOOD OR BAD

694
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
LED TO MORE INTELLIGENCE AND

695
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
LED TO HIGH LEVEL CAPTURES.

696
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
MEGYN: THERE IS APPARENTLY

697
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
EXTENDED INTERROGATION SCENE

698
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
SHOWS A TERRORIST BEING

699
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DESCRIBED AS COMPOSITE

700
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
CHARACTER, BEING

701
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
WATERBOARDED, DEPRIVED OF

702
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
SLEEP, CHAINED TO THE

703
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
CEILING, BEING BEATEN

704
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SEVERELY AND FORCED INTO A

705
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
SMALL BOX.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO CHAIRS

706
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
THE SENATE INTEL COMMITTEE

707
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
SAYS LOOK, WE DIDN'T DO ANY

708
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WATERBOARDING WHEN WE

709
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
INTERROGATED BIN LADEN'S

710
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
COURIER AT LEAST.

711
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
THEN THE DIRECTOR, CATHERINE

712
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
BIGELOW COMES OUT AND SAYS

713
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THE FILM IS BASED FULLY ON

714
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS OF THE

715
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
INVESTIGATION.

716
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
BIGELOW SEEMS TO BE SAYING

717
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
YOU DID TORTURE.

718
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
WE GOT THIS DIRECTLY FROM

719
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
OFFICIALS IN THE KNOW.

720
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND

721
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
OTHERS ARE SUGGESTING, NO,

722
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WE DIDN'T.

723
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

724
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
>> WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

725
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WATERBOARDING OF THE COURIER.

726
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
WATERBOARDING OF A SELECT

727
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
FEW, KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED

728
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
AND FEW OTHERS AFTER 9/11 WE

729
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
IDENTIFIED WE WERE USING

730
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THIS TECHNIQUE.
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF

731
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
HE SAID/SHE SAID.
THERE IS THREE-YEAR

732
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
INVESTIGATION ONGOING WHICH

733
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
WILL BE THE DEFINITIVE

734
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
REPORT ON ENHANCED

735
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES AND

736
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
EFFICACY.

737
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
SHE HAS ACCESS TO THAT.

738
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
DID WAR BOARDING LEAD TO THE

739
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
NAME OF THE CURRIER? MAYBE

740
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
NOT.

741
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
DID WATERBOARDING LEAD TO

742
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
OTHER INFORMATION THAT LED
TO THE COURIER?

743
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
POSSIBLY.

744
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
A TO B TO C IS GOOD

745
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
INTELLIGENCE WORK AND IT

746
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
COULD HAVE STARTED WITH GOOD

747
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
ENHANCED INTERROGATION

748
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
TECHNIQUES.

749
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.

750
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
MEGYN: IS THE WATERBOARDING

751
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
PORTRAYED IN THE FILM

752
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SUPPOSEDLY TAKEN PLACE UNDER

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
THE MOVIE SEEMS TO SORT OF

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
SUGGEST THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

762
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
KNEW ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT

763
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
GOES STRAIGHT FROM THE

EXPERTS SAY THAT IS FOR A

813
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
COUPLE REASONS.
ONE, FOR PERSONAL SAFETY.

814
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
AND TWO, THE PEOPLE BELIEVE

815
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000

THEY HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
SOMETHING TO VILIFY.

829
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SO MUCH EASIER TO VILIFY A

THEY MIGHT HAVE SOLD MORE

917
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THEY MADE THEM CHOOSE WHICH ONE

918

WOULD BE SHOT FIRST AND THEN

919
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
HELD MOCK SHOOTINGS.

920
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
WE'LL HA THIS IN

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
A LIVE REPORT IN MOMENT.

922
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTHCARE
OVERHAIL WAS BASED ON A CRITICAL

923
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
NET WORK OF STATE EXCHANGES.

924
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
AN ONLINE SITE THAT WOULD HELP

925
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT PLAN YOU

926
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR AND HOW

927
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
MUCH IT WOULD COST YOU.

928
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ALL THAT TAKES BODIES AND

929
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
RESOURCES.

930
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THE STATES WERE SUPPOSED TO DO

931
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
IT.
BUT THE MAJORITY OF STATE ARE

932
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
SAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO

933
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
IT OR AT A MINIMUM THEY WANT TO

934
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL

935
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
GOVERNMENT TO DO IT.

936
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
SO THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK HERE

937
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
FOR UNCLE SAM THAN THEY

938
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
ANTICIPATED WHEN THEY PASSED

939
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THIS BILL AND WHEN THEY FUNDED

940
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THIS BILL.

941
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US TODAY?

942
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
LESS MYANMAR SHAWL AND LARS

943
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
LARSON.

944
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THE FEDS ARE SAYING WE ARE

945
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
GOING TO SUBSIDIZE HEALTH

946
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
INSURANCE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

947
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

948
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
IT'S LIKE AN ORBITZ.

949
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
YOU GO ONLINE.

950
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
MEGYN KELLY NEW YORK, HOW OLD

951
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ARE YOU -- YOU CAN LIKE THE UP.

952
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
MEDICAL BACKGROUND.

953
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
RACE.
THEY ASK YOU ALL YOUR BACKGROUND

954
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THINGS.
YOU PLUG IN YOUR INFORMATION AND

955
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
SOMEBODY HAS TO SET UP THE

956
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ONLINE THING AND BE ON THE

957
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
RECEIVING END TO PROCESS THE

958
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
INFO SUCH AS THEY CAN RETURN

959
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
BACK TO YOU.

960
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
IF YOU QUALIFY FOR THE GOLD PLAN

961
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
AT THIS RATE.

962
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDY

963
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
YOU WOULD GET AND THIS IS HOW

964
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
YOU GO ABOUT GETTING IT.

965
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
25 STATES HAVE DEFAULT OUGHT

966
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
STATES ENTIRELY AND ANOTHER 7

967
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
SAID WE WANT AT A MINIMUM TO

968
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
PARTNER WITH THE FEDS.

969
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SO YOU HAVE GOT 32 STATES SAYING

970
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE

971
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
ENTIRELY OR PARTIALLY

972
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
RESPONSIBLE.

973
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
THEY DIDN'T PLAN ON THAT.

974
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET THIS

975
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
DONE?
>> I THINK THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY

976
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THERE.
WHAT I HEAR IS JOB CREATION

977
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WHETHER IT'S ON A STATE OR

978
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
FEDERAL LEVEL.

979
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
MEGYN: THERE WERE REPORTS THEY

980
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
WERE TALKING ABOUT ROBBING PETER

981
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
TO PAY PAUL, TAKING IT OUT OF A

982
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
DIFFERENT BUDGET OF THE FEDS AND

983
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
USING THAT MONEY.

984
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
IT COULD BE A BILLION PLUS, AND

985
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
USING THAT MONEY TO SET THIS UP.

986
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
>> THE MONEY THEY DID PLAN ON

987
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WAS MONEY THEY WOULD APPROPRIATE

988
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
TO EACH STATE.

989
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'M ASSUMING HERE NOW.

990
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE

991
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
APPROPRIATING AS MUCH TO A STATE

992
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THAT'S GOING TO SAY THE FEDERAL

993
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
GOVERNMENT HAS TO HANDLE THE

994
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SETUP OF THAT HEALTHCARE ORBITZ

995
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
ENTIRELY.
I'M ALSO HEARING PEOPLE SAID ON

996
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
THE RIGHT LIKE MY BUDDY LARS WHO

997
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
WE'LL HEAR FROM IN A MINUTE, I

998
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
CAN'T WAIT -- WHAT I HEAR IS WE

999
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WANT LESS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

1000
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
BUT YOU GUYS HANDLE THIS.

1001
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WE WANT POWER TO GO TO THE

1002
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
STATES AND THE STATES SAYING WE

1003
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

1004
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
COME ON.

1005
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
MEGYN: THE STATES WEREN'T THE

1006
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
ONES WHO PASSED OBAMA-CARE.

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THIS WAS A FEDERAL EFFORT AND

1008
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THEY WERE TOLD BY THE FEDS YOU

1009
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
ARE DOING IT.

1010
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
>> THIS THING IS A MESS.

1011
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> A GUY NAME MITT ROMNEY SAID

1012
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
THE REASON IT WORKED IN

1013
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
MASSACHUSETTS AND THE REASON

1014
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR HE SIGNED

1015
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
OFF ON IT AND WANTED IT WAS

1016
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
BECAUSE IT WAS A STATE-RUN

1017
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
PROGRAM.

1018
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
THIS IS AT LEAST A PORTION OF

1019
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THE POWER AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

1020
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
GIVE TO THE VARIOUS STATES.

1021
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
>> THIS THING HAS BEEN A

1022
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
DISASTER.
BUT YOU HIT ON ONE OF THE

1023
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ANSWERS.
IF ORBITZ SET THIS UP, IF

1024
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
PRIVATE INDUSTRY HAD DONE IT.

1025
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER.

1026
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE SET UP A

1027
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
SEPARATE ORBITZ FOR EVERY STATE

1028
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
IN AMERICA.

1029
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
AN AWFUL LOT OF AMERICANS, THE

1030
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
MAJORITY OF AMERICAN STATES

1031
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OPPOSE THIS PLAN.

1032
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
FURTHER, THE EXCHANGES ARE

1033
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
RIDICULOUS BECAUSE THEY WILL

1034
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
ONLY DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO OBTAIN

1035
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE NOT FROM

1036
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
THE GOVERNMENT, AND NOT FROM

1037
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THEIR EMPLOYER WHICH IS THE

1038
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
MAJORITY OF THE REST OF THE

1039
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
PEOPLE NOT COVERED BY MEDAID

1040
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
AND MEDICARE.
THEY HAVE TO BUY IT INDIVIDUALLY

1041
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
AND IT WILL GO TO THESE

1042
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
EXCHANGES.
BUT IN MOST EXCHANGES YOU CAN

1043
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
BITE EXPENSIVE AIRLINE TICKET

1044
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
OTHER INEXPENSIVE AIRLINE

1045
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
TICKET.

1046
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
THIS WON'T GIVE YOU THAT CHOICE

1047
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
BECAUSE OBAMA CARE MANDATES THE

1048
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
MINIMUM PLAN IS A CADILLAC PLAN.

1049
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
SO HOW MUCH CHOICE ARE YOU GOING

1050
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
TO HAVE WHEN THE FEDERAL

1051
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS IS THE

1052
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
LEAST YOU CAN OFFER WHICH IS

1053
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
EVERYTHING INTO THE PLAN KIND OF

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
OFFER.

1055
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
MEGYN: THAT SPEAKS TO WHETHER

1056
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
OBAMA-CARE IS GOOD OR BAD PORE

1057
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
INADEQUATE OR ADEQUATE.

1058
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

1059
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THE LAW PASSED.

1060
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
NOW IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER

1061
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THIS WILL BE ADEQUATELY

1062
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDS WHEN

1063
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THEY WERE NOT PLANNING TO BE --

1064
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I LIKE WHAT YOU SAID, HEALTHCARE

1065
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ORBITZ.
THEY WERE NOT PLANNING TO RUN

1066
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HEALTHCARE ORBITZ.

1067
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> THEY WERE FUNDING IT.

1068
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
AND LET ME POINT SOMETHING ELSE

1069
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
OUT.

1070
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
MEGYN: FUNDING IT IS DIFFERENT

1071
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THAN HAVING THE BODIES TO SET UP

1072
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THE WEB SITE AND DO THE

1073
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
PROCESSING, THIS AGE, THIS KIND

1074
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
OF A SMOKER, THIS CHALLENGE

1075
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
TAKE.
THIS FAMILY HISTORY.

1076
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
THAT TAKES PEOPLE AND RESOURCES.

1077
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
>> IT THERE WAS ALREADY

1078
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
SOMETHING FOR OTHER KINDS OF

1079
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
INSURANCE CALLED QUOTE SMITH
WHERE YOU COULD FIND QUOTES ON

1080
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
OTHER KINDS OF INSURANCE.

1081
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
IF PRIVATE INDUSTRY HAD DONE

1082
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THIS WE WOULD HAVE SEEN

1083
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
COMPETITION.

1084
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I DON'T MEAN JUST IN THE KIND OF

1085
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
PLAN OFFERED.

1086
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
YOU WOULD HAVE EVEN THE PRIVATE

1087
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
CITY STEP TO THE FORE.

1088
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
THEY OFFER PRODUCTS THAT ARE A,

1089
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
COMPLICATED, AND B EXPENSIVE.

1090
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CHOICES.

1091
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS COULD HAVE

1092
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
BEEN DONE BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY.

1093
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WRINKLE

1094
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
THAT ONLY AN ALBANY LAW GRADUATE

1095
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT.

1096
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
IT PROVIDED IF YOU GO TO A STATE

1097
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
EXCHANGE AND NEED THE SUBSIDY

1098
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

1099
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
LAW ALLOWS FOR A CHECK TO BE

1100
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
CUT.

1101
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
IF IT'S THROUGH THE FEDERAL

1102
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
EXCHANGE THE LAW APPEARS TO HAVE

1103
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
A FLAW TONIGHT THAT DOES NOT

1104
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

1105
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
CUT CHECKS.

1106
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THAT A REAL PROBLEM.

1107
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
MEGYN: THERE IS ANOTHER

1108
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
CHALLENGE THAT HAS TO DO WITH

1109
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
WHETHER THEY CAN TAX -- YOU KNOW

1110
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
HOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY A

1111
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
PEN FAT YOU DON'T INSURE YOUR

1112
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
EMPLOYEES?

1113
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THESE CORPORATIONS THAT IF THEY

1114
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HAVE MORE THAN 50 EMPLOYEES THEY

1115
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY.

1116
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
NOW THERE IS A LEGAL CHALLENGE

1117
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
BUBBLING UP ABOUT WHETHER THAT

1118
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
PROVISION OF THE LAW CAN BE

1119
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
SUSTAINED IF THE EXCHANGES ARE

1120
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
RUN BY THE FEDS VERSUS THE

1121
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
STATES.
I DON'T WANT TO GET THAT DEEP

1122
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
INTO IT BECAUSE YOUR HEAD WILL

1123
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
HE CAN MOWED.

1124
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
BUT THIS WRINKLE OPENED UP A NEW

1125
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
POSSIBLE CHALLENGE TO THE CORE

1126
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OF THE LAW.

1127
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR DAYS

1128
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THE

1129
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MONEY?
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THAT

1130
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
EXTRA MONEY?

1131
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
IS THE COST OF THIS LAW

1132
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
BALLOONING IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT

1133
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
ANTICIPATED BY SOME?

1134
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO FOR

1135
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
SEVERAL REASONS.

1136
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
ONE, I DO FEEL THE MONEY THAT

1137
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WOULD BE APPROPRIATED SAY HERE

1138
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
IN CALIFORNIA AND WE SAY YOU

1139
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
GUYS HANDLE IT.

1140
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
THEY WON'T GIVE US THE MONEY FOR

1141
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THAT BECAUSE WE WON'T BE

1142
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
HANDLING THAT.
I DON'T SEAT ISSUE WITH

1143
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
FINANCES.

1144
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
LARS, TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

1145
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

1146
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ALL THOSE BIG CEOs AT AETNA

1147
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
AND BLUE CROSS.

1148
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THEY HAVE THE POWER BEFORE THIS

1149
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
WAS PASSED AND THEY STILL HAVE

1150
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THE TOUR LOWER THEIR RATES.

1151
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
SO IT AMUSES ME WHEN THEY SAY

1152
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
OBAMA-CARE IS GOING TO INCREASE

1153
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
RATES THAT THEY HAVE 100%

1154
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
CONTROL OVER SITTING AT THE

1155
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
HEADS OF THEIR PRIVATE

1156
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
COMPANIES.
>> TO HER POINT.

1157
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ACTUARIES TELL YOU WHAT THOSE

1158
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
POLICYS HAVE TO COST.

1159
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE MARKETPLACE AND THE REAL

1160
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
COST OF DOING IT.

1161
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
YOU WILL SEE AN AWFUL LOT OF

1162
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
STATES.

1163
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
MEGYN: DID YOU USE THE WORD

1164
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
ACTUARIES?

1165
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

1166
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1167
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000

HIS PRISON BED.

1170
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THE BIGGEST ASSIST THEY MAY HAVE

1171
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
GOTTEN FROM AN UNLIKELY ALLY

1172
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
INSIDE MEXICO.

1173

WE'LL HEAR FIRSTHAND ABOUT A

WE GOT A PICTURE OF HIM LOCKED

1186
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
UP INSIDE OF ONE OF MEXICO'S

1187
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
MOST DANGEROUS PRISONS.

1188
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
HIS NAME IS JOHN HAMMER.

1189
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
SHIRTLESS AND CHAINED TO A BED.

1190
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
WE ARE TOLD IT WAS SENT TO HIS

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
FAMILY FROM AN ANONYMOUS MEXICAN

1192
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
E-MAIL ACCOUNT.

1193
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
HE FACES CHARGES FOR CARRYING

1194
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
THIS GUN, A FAMILY HEIRLOOM,

1195
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
OVER THE BORDER.

1196
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
BREAKING EARLIER TODAY A BIG

1197
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN INSIDE THE

1198
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
NORTHERN MEXICO PRESSED THEIR

1199
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OWN GOVERNMENT FOR HIS RELEASE

1200
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT

1201
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
AMERICAN TOURISTS AND MAKING

1202
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
MEXICO ATTRACTIVE TO US.

1203
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE UNHAPPY

1204
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THE WAY OUR MARINE IS BEING

1205
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
TREATED BY OUR SO-CALLED FRIEND

1206
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
MEXICO.

1207
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
JOINING US, THE PARENTS OF JOHN

1208
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
HAMMER.
A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE OUTRAGED

1209
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
BY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR SON.

1210
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT CLEAR HE MAY

1211
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
HAVE VIOLATED SOME MEXICAN LAW

1212
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
ABOUT BRINGING THE GUN IN.

1213
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
IT MAY HAVE BEEN TOO SHORT OR

1214
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
TOO LONG BY AN INCH.

1215
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST SAY WHEN HE

1216
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
STOPPED AND SHOWED THEM THE GUN.

1217
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
SAY CAN'T TAKE IT, DOESN'T

1218
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
COMPLY WITH OUR LAWS, TURN

1219
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AROUND AND GO BACK HOME.

1220
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT.

1221
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I CAN ONLY SPECULATE THEY WERE

1222
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
HOPING THAT HE WOULD OFFER THEM

1223
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
A BRIBE.

1224
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
THAT WAS OUR -- THAT'S WHAT A

1225
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US.

1226
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
IF HE HAD OFFERED THEM A BRIBE

1227
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID

1228
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THIS.
MEGYN: THAT COMPORTS WITH YOUR

1229
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
EXPERIENCE.

1230
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I KNOW YOU GOT A CALL FROM THIS

1231
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
MEXICAN PRISON AND TELL US WHAT

1232
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THEY DEMANDED.

1233
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
>> THEY DEMANDED MONEY.

1234
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
FOR HIS SAFETY AND THEY SAID

1235
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THEY WERE GOING TO KILL HIM IF

1236
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
WE DIDN'T SEND IT IMMEDIATELY.

1237
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
YOU KNOW, AT THE BORDER CROSSING

1238
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT THEY

1239
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
IDENTIFIED HIM AS AN AMERICAN

1240
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
VET AND WANTED TO STICK IT TO

1241
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
HIM ALSO, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN

1242
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
JUST MONEY.
MEGYN: HE'S 27 YEARS OLD.

1243
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
HE DID MULTIPLE TOURS IN IRAQ

1244
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AND AFGHANISTAN.

1245
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
HE WAS SUFFERING FROM POST

1246
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

1247
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
HE WAS GOING TO MEXICO TO DO

1248
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SOME HUNTING WITH HIS FRIEND.

1249
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
THIS IS HOW HE BURNS OFF STRESS.

1250
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAID IT

1251
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
DOESN'T QUITE COMPORT WITH OUR

1252
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
LAWS SO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

1253
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
HEIRLOOM ARE IN VIOLATION OF OUR

1254
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
LAWS.
HE'S BEEN SITTING THERE FOR FOUR

1255
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
MONTHS.

1256
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
THIS PICTURE WE HAVE OF HIM

1257
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
CHAINED TO THE BED LIKE A DOG --

1258
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ORIGINALLY THEY HAD HIM IN THE

1259
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
GENERAL POPULATION OF THIS

1260
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PRISON THAT'S FULL OF MEXICAN

1261
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
DRUG CARTEL MEMBERS.

1262
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
>> THAT RIGHT.

1263
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THAT'S WHEN WE BEGAN RECEIVING

1264
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THE EXTORTION CALLS.

1265
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THE MOVE FROM THE HIM THAT THE

1266
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
CONSULATE WAS ABLE TO ARRANGE TO

1267
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
THIS@SER AREA WAS TO TRY AND

1268
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
CIRCUMVENT THAT HAPPENING AGAIN.

1269
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
MEGYN: NOW I UNDERSTAND BASED ON

1270
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
SOME PHONE CALLS THAT WERE MADE

1271
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
BY AMERICAN OFFICIALS, THEY

1272
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
REMOVED THE CHAIN FROM HIS LEG

1273
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AT LEAST?

1274
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
>> YES, I BELIEVE AS OF LAST

1275
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
WEDNESDAY THE CHAIN WAS REMOVED.

1276
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
MEGYN: I KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST

1277
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
TIME YOU HAVE SEEN A PICTURE OF

1278
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HIM.

1279
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SAW

1280
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
IT?
>> SICK.

1281
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
YOU KNOW -- IT'S LIKE A

1282
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
"NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" SHOW THAT
YOU WATCHED EXCEPT IT'S YOUR

1283
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
SON.

1284
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE.

1285
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
MEGYN: JOHN, WE WERE TOLD

1286
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
CONSULAR OFFICERS HAVE VISITED

1287
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
YOUR SON FOUR TIMES IN PRISON.

1288
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT MADE SURE

1289
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
HIS RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND

1290
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH THEY CAN

1291
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
DO.
THIS WILL PLAY OUT IN THE

1292
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
MEXICAN LEGAL SYSTEM THE SAME

1293
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
WAY IT WOULD PLAY OUT IN THE

1294
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
U.S. SYSTEM IF A MEXICAN GOT

1295
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
CAUGHT TRYING TO BRING AN

1296
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ILLEGAL FIREARM INTO OUR

1297
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
COUNTRY.

1298
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
>> IN THE LAST FEW DAYS --

1299
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
ESPECIALLY THE MEXICAN STATE

1300
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
DEPARTMENT, BUT OUR STATE

1301
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
DEPARTMENT, TOO, HAS BEEN

1302
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
PROTECTING THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF

FROM NEWTOWN.

1483
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000

1484
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
DEVELOPMENT IS ANOTHER FUNERAL

1485
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
PROCESSION PASSING BEHIND US.

1486
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
WE BELIEVE THIS IS FOR JESSICA

1487
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
REKOS.

1488
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
IT IS FOCUSING ON WHAT IF ANY

1489
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
MEDICATIONS ADAM LANZA MIGHT

1490
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
HAVE BEEN TAKING.

1491
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
THAT WAS THE QUESTION WE ALL

1492
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
ASKED IN THE MOMENT AFTER THIS

1493
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
ATTACK.

1494
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS THINK

1495
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
CERTAIN MEDICATIONS CAN

1496
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
CONTRIBUTE TO ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.

1497
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
AUTHORITIES ARE USING SEARCH

1498
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
WARRANTS TO OBTAIN MEDICAL

1499
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000

THE WORD OF ADAM'S ASPERGER'S

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE TO ADAM'S

SHOOTING SPREE.

1508
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
WE HAVE BEEN SEEING FUNERALS

1509
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000

1510
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
THAT'S WHERE EARLIER THIS

01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
HE BEAT HIS DUE DATE BY FOUR

1514
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
WEEKS BECAUSE HE WAS HUNGRY.

1515
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
THE SERVICES BEGAN FOR JESSICA

1516
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000

EVEN AS THE MOURNERS ARE PAYING

1520
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
THEIR RESPECTS.

1521
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
NEWTOWN REOPENED FIVE OF THE

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY IS STILL A

SATISFACTORILY ONE FUNERAL HOME

1544
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000

1545
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000

1546
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
>> Reporter: THEY HAD TO HIRE

1547
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
A COUPLE DOZEN MORE PEOPLE TO

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
VICTIM THAT NEED TO BE CARED FOR

1550
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
AND LAID TO REST.

1551
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
WE HEARD COMPELLING STORIES OF

1552
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
PEOPLE REACHING OUT.
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS TRYING

1553
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
TO SET UP A CHARITY THAT

1554
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
EVERYONE CAN GIVE TO.

1555
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
ONE CASE WE HEARD ABOUT WAS A

1556
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
COFFEE SHOP IN TOWN GOT A CALL

1557
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
FROM SOMEONE IN CALIFORNIA WHO

1558
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
WANTED TO BUY 100 CUPS OF COFFEE

1559
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
FOR MOURNERS.

1560
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T AFFORD

1561
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
BREAKFAST FOR EVERYONE BUT THEY

1562
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
COULD BUY THEM A COUP OF COFFEE.

1563
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
MEGYN: CHILDREN ARE BEING HELPED

1564
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
IN THE HEALING PROCESS BY MAN'S

1565
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
BEST FRIEND.

1566
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
SEVEN DOGS TRAINED TO COMFORT

1567
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
DISASTER SURVIVORS PUT SMILES ON

1568
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
THE FACES OF CHILDREN FOR THE

1569
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
FIRST TIME SINCE FRIDAY.

1570
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
THE DOGS OFFER A SENSE OF

1571
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
SECURITY THAT OTHERS CAN

1572
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
PROVIDE.

1573
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
THERE IS SOMETHING STRESS

1574
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
RELIEVING AND COMFORTING ABOUT

1575
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
PEGHT AN ANIMAL AND HAVING THE

1576
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
LOVER AN ANIMAL EVEN FIT MANY

1577
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
ONLY TEMPORARY.

1578
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
GREAT IDEA.

1579
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
WE HAVE BREAK NEWS OUT OF

1580
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
WASHINGTON OVER A PLAN TO HEAD

1581
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
OFF A TAX HIKE AND A BUNCH OF

1582
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
SPENDING CUTS.

1583
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
AT ONE POINT IT LOOKED LIKE BOTH

1584
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
SIDES WERE CLOSE TO A DEAL.

1585
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
TODAY NOT EXACTLY BUT WE'LL SEE.

1586
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
THE WHITE HOUSE REJECTED HOUSE

1587
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
SPEAK I ARE JOHN BOEHNER --

1588
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
HOUSE SPEAKER DOWNBOEHNER'S

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
BACKUP PROPOSAL.

1590
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO JAY CARNEY

1591
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

1592
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
TRYING TO COMPROMISE.

1593
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
>> THE FACT THAT HE'S WILLING TO

1594
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
COMPROMISE AND HAVE RATES GO UP

1595
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
ON THOSE MAKING $400,000 AND

1596
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
ABOVE AS OPPOSED TO $250,000 AND

1597
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
ABOVE DEMONSTRATES HIS GOOD

1598
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
FAITH EFFORT TO REACH A COME

1599
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
PREMICE AND STILL HAVE A PACKAGE

1600
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
THAT'S BALANCED AND ASKS THE

1601
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
WEALTHIEST TO PAY MORE.

1602
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
MEGYN: MELISSA FRANCES JOINS US.

1603
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
WHAT ARE THEY ARGUING OVER?

1604
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE GETTING

1605
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
CLOSE.
>> Reporter: IT SEEMS LIKE IT.

1606
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
THERE IS PLAN "A" AND PLAN "B."

1607
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
PLAN "A" IS THE NEGOTIATION

1608
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
GOING ON BETWEEN SPEAKER BARON

1609
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
AND THE PRESIDENT.

1610
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
THEY ARE GETTING CLOSE WITH THE

1611
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
PRESIDENT SAYING WE'LL RAISE

1612
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
TAXES ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE

1613
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
$400,000.

1614
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
HE BUMMED IT UP TO $400,000.

1615
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
BOEHNER WAS AT A MILLION.

1616
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
THERE ARE THOUGHTS THEY COULD

1617
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
SETTLE AT $500,000.

1618
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
THEN PLAN "B," THE BACKUP PLAN

1619
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
SAYING WE TAKE THIS BILL FROM

1620
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
THE SENATE.

1621
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THE HOUSE,

1622
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
WE SEND IT BACK.

1623
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
THAT STARTED AT $250,000.

1624
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
THAT ONE SPEAKER BOEHNER GOING

1625
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
IN WITH THIS OFFER OF $MILLION.

1626
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
THEY MIGHT SETTLE IN THE MIDDLE.

1627
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
ALL OF THESE PLANS TOGETHER CUT

1628
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
SPENDING BY A TRILLION.

1629
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
SO THEY ARE KIND OF -- IT'S

1630
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
ALMOST THIS ONE FOR ONE RATIO.

1631
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
THE GOOD OLD DAYS WE ARE TALK

1632
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
ABOUT CUTTING SPENDING BY 3-1.

1633
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE GONE.

1634
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
IT HAS A FEELING LIKE WE ARE

1635
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
GETTING CLOSER.
THERE ARE A COUPLE FLIES IN THE

1636
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
OINTMENT.

1637
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
THERE ARE ALL THE HOUSE

1638
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES,

1639
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
SAYING I DON'T KNOW WHO SPEAKER

1640
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
BOEHNER IS SPEAKING FOR.

1641
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ANY

1642
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
OF THIS.

1643
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
MEGYN: HISTORICALLY WE HAVE BEEN

1644
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
TOLD TAXES HAVE NEVER BEEN

1645
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
RAISED WHEN THE REPUBLICANS ARE

1646
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE.

1647
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
THEY DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A

1648
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
REVENUE PROBLEM, THEY BELIEVE WE

1649
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
HAVE A SPENDING PROBLEM.

1650
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
IF THEY DO THIS THEY WILL BE

1651
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
CHANGING HISTORY.

1652
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
>> Reporter: IT'S HARD TO

1653
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
IMAGINE THEY WILL.
THE THEORY IS WHY WOULD YOU FEED

1654
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
THE BEAST AND MAKE IT BIGGER.

1655
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
WE NEED TO STARVE IT.

1656
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
THIS IS THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT

1657
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
FOR SPEAKER BOEHNER FOR SURE.

1658
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
THERE IS A LOT OF TALK THAT HE

1659
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
DOESN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT TO CUT

1660
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
THESE DEALS.

1661
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
BRET BAIER BROKE OUT SOME

1662
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
FANTASTIC NUMBERS SAYING WE TAKE

1663

WE SPEND $11 BILLION.

1665
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU RAISE

1666
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
TAXES.

1667
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE RAN OUR

1668
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
HOUSEHOLDS LIKE THAT.

1669
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000

1672
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
THAT'S HOW WE ARE RUNNING OUR

1673
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
COUNTRY.
THE REALITY IS ALL OF THESE GOAR

1674
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
YAITIONS DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE

1675
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
TO SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS.

1676
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000

RICH AND SAY WE RAISED YOUR

1678
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
TAXES BY 4% TO%.

1679
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
WE ARE UNREALISTIC IN THE AMOUNT

1680
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
OF REVENUE WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED.

1681
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
AND AT SOME POINT THEY WILL HAVE

1682
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
TO TALK ABOUT SPENDING CUTS BUT

1683
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
NO ONE HAS THAT CURLING.

1684
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
EVEN THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING

1685
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
LET'S FORGET THE SPENDING CUTS.

1686
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000

1688
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
WE HAVE TO TURN INTO GREECE

1689
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
FIRST.

1690
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THESE

1691
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
SCENARIOS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

1692
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
IT'S ALL NOTHING.

1693
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
EVENTUALLY THEY RUN OUT OF

1694
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
MONEY.
THE FED KEEPS PRINT IT.

1695
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
MEGYN: IF WE ARE GOING TO BE

1696
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000

THE HILTON IN D.C.

1740
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
YOU CANNOT FORGET WHEN HE RAISED

1741
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000

LODGING ONE INCH FROM HIS HEART.

1747
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
HE WAS PUSHED INTO THE LIMO BY A

1748
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
SECRET SERVICE AGENT WHO WAS

1749
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000

1751
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
HE WALKED INTO THE HOSPITAL

1752
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
UNDER HIS OWN POWER.

1753
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
JOKING TO THE DOCTORS HOPING

1754
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
THEY WERE ALL REPUBLICANS.

1755
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
PRESS SECRETARY JAMES BRADY WAS

1756
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
SHOT IN THE HEAD.

1757
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
HE WAS PERMANENTLY DISABLED.

1758

HE WENT ON TO CHAMPION GUN

1759
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
CONTROL.
BUT EVEN AFTER JOHN LENNON WAS

1760
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
SHOT AND HE WAS SHOT, PRESIDENT

1761
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
REAGAN OPPOSED GUN CONTROL.

1762
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
THEN 10 YEARS LATER HE CAME OUT

1763
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
IN A LETTER SUPPORTING THE BRADY

1764
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000

KEEP IN MIND THE BRADY CENTER

1765
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
HAS RECENTLY COME OUT SAYING

1766
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST YEAR,

1767
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
THEY GAVE HIM 7 Fs FOR HIS

1768
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
EFFORTS ON GUN CONTROL.

1769
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
MEGYN: WHERE WOULD PRESIDENT

1770
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
REAGAN LIKELY STAND ON THIS

1771
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
TODAY?

1772
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT IT, HIS SON,

1773
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
MICHAEL REAGAN.
HE'S A POLITICAL CONSULTANT AND

1774
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
CHAIRMAN OF THE REAGAN GROUP.

1775
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
YOUR DAD HAD A UNIQUE

1776
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS.

1777
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
AS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT

1778
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
AFTER HE WAS SHOT AND 10 YEARS

1779
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
AFTER HE WAS SHOT.

1780
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
TAKE US THROUGH IT.

1781
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
>> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DAY

1782
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
WAS SHOT.
I SAID TO MIKE, HOW COULD YOU

1783
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
LET THIS HAPPEN WITH ALL THE

1784
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION MY

1785
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
FATHER HAD.

1786
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
HE SAID WE CAN TRAIN TO PROTECT

1787
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1788
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
STATES BUT WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE

1789
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
TO PROTEC PRO -- NEVER BE ABLE N

1790
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
ENOUGH TO PROTECT AGAINST THE

1791
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
CRAZIES.
MY FATHER WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED.

1792
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
NOT BY THE BULLET IN HIS CHEST.

1793
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
MY FATHER WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY

1794
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
THE BULLETS THAT ENTERED OTHER

1795
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
PEOPLE, WITH BULLETS THAT WERE

1796
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
MEANT FOR HIM.

1797
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
WITH MY FATHER FLYING BACK ON

1798
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
AIR ONE.

1799
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
MY FATHER COUNTED OUT THE NUMBER

1800
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
9.
I SAID WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT

1801
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
THE NUMBER 9.

1802
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
HE SAID IN 9 MORE MONTHS I'LL NO

1803
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
LONGER BE PRESIDENT.

1804
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I SAID WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO

1805
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
YOU?
HE SAID I CAN GO BACK TO CHURCH.

1806
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
HE SAID EVERY SINCE I LOOKED OUT

1807
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
THE WINDOW OF THAT CAR THAT DAY

1808
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
AND SAW PEOPLE LAYING IN THEIR

1809
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
OWN BLOOD IN BULLETS MEANT FOR

1810
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
ME.

1811
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN

1812
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
HARM'S WAY IF I ENTERED A ROOM.

1813
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
SO I HAVE NOT BEEN GOING TO

1814
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
CHURCH ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

1815
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD

1816
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
TO.
GROWING UP MY FATHER OWNED WHAT

1817
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
WOULD BE DEEMED AN ASSAULT

1818
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
RIFLE.

1819
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
A .22 CALIBER SEMIAUTOMATIC AND

1820
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
15 LONG RIFLES.

1821
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
HE GAVE ME A GUN WHEN I WAS 10

1822
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
YEARS OLD.

1823
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
HE BELIEVED IN GUN

1824
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS WHAT HE

1825
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
TRULY BELIEVED IN.

1826
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
GROWING UP AS A FATHER, TEACHING

1827
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
A RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY OF

1828
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
THE RIFLE.

1829
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

1830
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
1991 IS AN INTERESTING YEAR IN

1831
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
MY FATHER'S LIFE.

1832
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
LET ME JUMP IN FOR ONE SECOND.

1833
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
RIGHT AFTER AWAS SHOT IN 1981 HE

1834
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
CAME OUT AND SAID HE HADN'T

1835
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
CHANGED HIS POSITION ON GUN

1836
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
CONTROL.
HE SAID HE OPPOSED GUN CONTROL

1837
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
AND SAID HE WAS DISTURBED WITH

1838
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
ALL THE FOCUS ON GUN CONTROL AS

1839
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
AN ANSWER FOR OUR PROBLEM.

1840
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000

1844

1845

THIS LEGISLATION -- THIS

1847

1849

THAT LEGISLATION, THE BRADY BILL

1850
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
HAD BEEN LAW IN 1981.

1851
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000

1852

1853
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000

THE TIME.

1857
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000

THAT TAKING GUNS AWAY FROM

1863
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000

1864
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000

CAN'T GET HELP.

1878
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000

ARE LIVING WITH AND GOING

1901
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000

WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIND A WAY

TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN.

1904

1913

1914
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000

1915
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
WHETHER ADAM LANZA MANY MOTHER'R

1916
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
WOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE OF

1917
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000

1918
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
WEAPONS BAN WOULD HAVE BEEN IN

1919
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
PLACE.
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

1920
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
A REPORT SAYS TWO OF THE GUNS

1921
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN BAND BUT THE

1922
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000

THIS SEEMS TO BE WHERE IT'S

1936
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000

HOW DO YOU STOP ANYBODY FROM

1937
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000

1938
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000

1940
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000

BRAVE STUDENTS THAT SURVIVED

2077
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
THAT DAY.

2078
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
LAST FRIDAY MORNING GENE

LEARNED EXACTLY WHAT THEY

2086
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
HAD JUST BEEN THROUGH.

2087
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
HE WAS SO INSPIRED ABOUT THE

2088
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
PERCENT VAERNS FROM THE

2089
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
TRAGEDY HE IS LEARNING THE

01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
LESSONS FROM THE YOUNG

01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000

GOD BLESS YOU FOR THE HELP

01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
YOU PROVIDED THOSE YOUNG

2097
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
CHILDREN IN SUCH A TRAUMATIC

2098
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
MOMENT.

2099
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
TAKE US THROUGH IT.

2100
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
YOU WALK OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

2101
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO GET

2102
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
BREAKFAST AND WHAT DID YOU

2103
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
SEE AT THE END OF THE

2104
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
DRIVEWAY?

2105
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
>> I SAW SIX CHILDREN AT THE

2106
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
END OF THE DRIVEWAY AND I

2107
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
SAW A MAN SPEAKING KIND OF

2108
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
HARSHLY TO THEM IN A LOUD

2109
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
VOICE SAYING, IT'S GOING TO

2110
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
BE ALL RIGHT, IT'S GOING TO

2111
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
BE ALL RIGHT.

2112
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SKIT OR A

2113
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
PLAY OR SOME CUB SCOUTS

2114
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
SCOUTS WERE REHEARSING.

2115
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
THEY WERE SITTING IN A VERY

2116
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
ORDERLY WAY AND I, I HAD NO

2117
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
CLUE THAT ANYTHING HAD

2118
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
HAPPENED.
WHEN I START GETTING CLOSER

2119
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
TO THEM I COULD SEE THE

2120
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
DISTRESS AND THE FEAR AND

2121
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
THE DISORDER THEY HAD JUST

2122
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
WITNESSED.

2123
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
THEY SEEMED OUT OF BREATH.

2124
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
THERE WAS A SCHOOL BUS

2125
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
DRIVER WITH THEM.

2126
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
AND I SAID, COME ON INSIDE.

2127
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
COME ON INSIDE.

2128
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
AND THEY JUST FOLLOWED ME.

2129
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
MEGYN: HOW DID YOU FIRST

2130
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
LEARN, IT WAS FOUR LITTLE

2131
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
GIRLS AND TWO LITTLE BOYS,

2132
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
THAT THEY HAD JUST RUN,

2133
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
LITERALLY FROM VICTORIA

2134
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
SOTO'S CLASSROOM, A TEACHER

2135
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
WHO WAS KILLED IN FRONT OF

2136
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
THEM?

2137
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:15,000
>> I DINL LEARN ABOUT IT

2138
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
UNTIL 15 MINUTES OR 20

2139
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
MINUTES IN THEIR STAY AT MY

2140
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
HOUSE.

2141
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I BROUGHT DOWN MY GRANDSON'S

2142
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
STUFFED ANIMALS.

2143
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
AND THEY PLAYED WITH THEM.

2144
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
THEY DIDN'T SAY VERY MUCH.

2145
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I BROUGHT THEM SOME JUICE.

2146
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
AND THEN THEY SEEMED TO BE

2147
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
CALMER.

2148
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
WE WENT TO A DIFFERENT ROOM.

2149
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
AND THEN, IT ALL STARTED

2150
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
UNFOLDING AND IT STARTED

2151
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
THIS WAY.

2152
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
THIS BOY SAID, WE CAN'T GO

2153
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
BACK.

2154
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE

2155
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
SCHOOL.
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

2156
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
WE DON'T HAVE A TEACHER.

2157
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

2158
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
AND THEY KEPT REPEATING

2159
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
THAT.

2160
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I COULD NOT FATHOM WHAT THEY

2161
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
WERE SAYING.

2162
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I COULD NOT TAKE IT IN WHAT

2163
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
THEY WERE SAYING.

2164
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
AND THEN ONE OF THEM SAID,

2165
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
OUR TEACHER IS DEAD.

2166
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

2167
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
MRS. SOTO IS DEAD.

2168
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
AND I THINK ONE OF THE GIRLS

2169
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
SAID, THERE WAS BLOOD IN HER

2170
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
MOUTH AND SHE FELL DOWN.

2171
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
AND THEN SOMEHOW THEY ESCAPED.

2172
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
AND MEGYN, I DON'T KNOW THE

2173
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
DETAILS OF THEIR ESCAPE.

2174
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ESCAPED

2175
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
BUT THEY MUST HAVE RUN SOME

2176
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
PORTION OF THE ROAD THAT IS

2177
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
NEXT TO THE FIREHOUSE AND

2178
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
WAS PICKED UP, WERE PICKED

2179
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
UP BY A SCHOOL BUS DRIVER.

2180
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

2181
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
ESCAPED BUT UNTIL I SAW

2182
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
VICTORIA SOTO'S NAME IN THE

2183
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
CASUALTY LIST I COULD NOT

2184
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
BELIEVE IT BECAUSE IT WAS

2185
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
UNFATHOMABLE.

2186
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
MEGYN: THEY WERE WITHIN

2187
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
INCHES OF DYING THEMSELVES

2188
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
AND IT WAS MOMENTS AFTER

2189
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
WHEN THEY WERE IN YOUR HOME.

2190
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
WHAT WAS THEIR AFFECT?

2191
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
KIDS ARE SO RESILIENT AND

2192
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EVIL

2193
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
THE WAY WE DO AND DON'T

2194
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
UNDERSTAND HORROR THE WAY WE

2195
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
DO SO WHAT WAS THEIR AFFECT

2196
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
WHEN THEY WERE WITH YOU?

2197
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
>> THEY WERE INITIALLY KIND

2198
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
OF AGITATED.

2199
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
AND THEN THE STUFFED ANIMALS

2200
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
SEALED TO CALM THEM DOWN.

2201
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
THEN THEY TOLD THEIR STORY,

2202
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
AND, IT JUST WAS SO HARD TO

2203
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
BELIEVE.
AND THEN AS IF GOD HAD SENT

2204
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
DOWN A LITTLE ANGEL THERE

2205
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
WAS A RESPITE FROM THE

2206
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
TERROR AND ONE OF THE BOYS

2207
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
WHO MUST BE A VERY ASSERTIVE,

2208
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
CLEVER, DIRECT BOY, HE SAID,

2209
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
HE CHANGED HIS COMPOSURE AND

2210
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
HE PUT UP HIS HAND AND HE

2211
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
SAID, JUST SAYING, YOUR

2212
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
HOUSE IS VERY SMALL.

2213
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
AND I WANTED TO HOLD HIM.

2214
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
AND I WANTED, I THOUGHT AT

2215
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THAT MOMENT HE HAD, HE HAD

2216
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
JUST BROUGHT US OUT OF HELL

2217
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
FOR JUST A MOMENT AND I WILL

2218
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
NEVER FORGET THAT.

2219
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
MEGYN: OH, GENE.

2220
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
>> AND MY, MY, MY DESIRE IS

2221
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
TO HAVE PARENTS CALL ME AND

2222
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
TO REUNITE WITH THESE

2223
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
CHILDREN AND TO READ TO THEM

2224
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
AND TO BE WITH THEM AND TO

2225
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
LOVE THEM AND TO LET THEM

2226
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
KNOW THAT I'LL HELP THEM

2227
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
FIND THE LIGHT BECAUSE THEY

2228
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
WERE IN THE DARKNESS.

2229
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
THAT'S MY HOPE IS.

2230
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
MEGYN: GENE, WHAT, WHAT

2231
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
HAPPENED IN TERMS OF

2232
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
CONTACTING THEIR PARENTS?

2233
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
THE PARENTS OF THESE

2234
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
CHILDREN WERE FRANTIC THAT

2235
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
AFTERNOON.

2236
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
OF COURSE I'M SURE THE

2237
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
CHILDREN WANTED NOTHING MORE

2238
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
TO SEE THEIR MOMS AND DADS

2239
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
AS SOON AS THEY COULD.

2240
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
HOW DID YOU MAKE THOSE PHONE

2241
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
CALLS?

2242
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

2243
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
>> WELL WE STARTED CALLING

2244
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY

2245
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
TOLD US THEIR NUMBERS BUT WE

2246
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
WOULD GET THEIR HOME PHONES

2247
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVER HAD

2248
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO CALL

2249
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
HER SUPERVISOR WHO MUST HAVE

2250
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
HAD THEIR CONTACT LIST,

2251
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
THEIR, ALL THE DETAILS OF

2252
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
THEIR CONTACT.

2253
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
AND SHE STARTED CALLING THE

2254
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
PARENTS FROM SOME OFFICE I

2255
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
ASSUME.

2256
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
AND THEN THE PARENTS START

2257
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
COMING.

2258
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
AND WHEN THEY CAME IN I FELT

2259
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
SO JOYFUL.

2260
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I FELT MORE JOYFUL THAN I

2261
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
COULD EVER TELL YOU.

2262
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
AND THERE WAS A HUSH IN THE

2263
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
ROOM AND I THINK THE KIDS

2264
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
SPOKE VERY HALTINGLY AND

2265
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
QUIETLY AS IF THEY WERE

2266
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
WHISPERING A HORRIBLE SECRET

2267
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
BUT THEIR PARENTS WERE SO

2268
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
RELIEVED AND I WAS SO HAPPY.

2269
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I WAS SO HAPPY FOR THEM.

2270
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
MEGYN: MY GOODNESS I CAN'T

2271
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
IMAGINE FOR THOSE PARENTS

2272
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
HEARING THAT THEIR CHILDREN

2273
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
WERE SAFE AND AT THIS OTHER

2274
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
LOCATION BECAUSE PARENTS

2275
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
WERE WAITING FOR CHILDREN AT

2276
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

2277
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
THAT'S WHERE POLICE HAVE

2278
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
DIRECTED THEM.

2279
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
THESE PARENTS CHILDREN WERE

2280
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
NOT SHOWING UP AT THE

2281
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
FIREHOUSE, YET THEY WERE AT

2282
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
THIS RESPITE AND RESCUED

2283
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THEMSELVES AND WITH THE HELP

2284
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
OF YOU AND THAT BUS DRIVER

2285
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
STAYING SAFE.

2286
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
GENE, I KNOW THAT SADLY

2287
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
THOSE WERE NOT THE ONLY

2288
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
PARENTS YOU FACED THAT DAY.

2289
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
AFTER THE CHILDREN WERE,

2290
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
WENT HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS

2291
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
YOU GOT ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE

2292
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
DOOR?

2293
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
>> THIS IS THE WORST THING

2294
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
THAT HAPPENED.

2295
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CAME TO

2296
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
MY DOOR.

2297
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
SHE WAS SO PRETTY BUT HER

2298
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
FACE WAS FROZEN.

2299
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
IT WAS FROZEN IN FEAR.

2300
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
IT LOOKED, LOOKED LIKE STONE

2301
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
AND SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HER

2302
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
SON.

2303
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I KNOW SHE FELT GOD WAS

2304
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
GOING TO GIVE HER A MIRACLE

2305
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
AND SO DID I.

2306
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
SHE NAMED HER SON AND SHE

2307
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
SAID, IS MY SON HERE?

2308
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
AND I, SHE SAID I HEARD SIX

2309
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
KIDS WERE HERE?

2310
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
AND I SAID NO, HE'S NOT BUT

2311
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
MAYBE HE IS AT THE

2312
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
FIREHOUSE.

2313
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
THIS WAS WELL AFTER, I THINK

2314
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN

2315
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
ACCOUNTED FOR.

2316
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
AND I WALKED DOWN TO THE

2317
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
FIREHOUSE AND I LOST HER.

2318
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I SHY SHE WENT WENT AWAY.

2319
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
LATER IN THE DAY I LOOKED AT

2320
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
THE CASUALTY LIST AND, AND

2321
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
HER SON WAS ON IT.

2322
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
AND I WANT TO SEE THIS WOMAN

2323
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
AND SHAKE HER HAND AND HOLD

2324
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
HER.

2325
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I WANT TO PRAY FOR HER.

2326
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I, I CAN'T IMAGINE, I CAN'T

2327
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
IMAGINE WHAT SHE

2328
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
EXPERIENCED.
I WISH THAT BOY HAD BEEN

2329
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
SITTING ON THE COUCH.

2330
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I WISH I COULD HAVE GIVEN

2331
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
HER BOY BUT HE PERISHED.

2332
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
MEGYN: I KNOW --

2333
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
>> FOR NO REASON.

2334
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
MEGYN: YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

2335
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
THE DESPERATION OF THOSE

2336
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
PARENTS ONCE THEY HEARD THAT

2337
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
THERE WERE SOME CHILDREN WHO

2338
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
HAD SAVED THEMSELVES AND

2339
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
GOTTEN TO SAFETY AND WANTING

2340
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
TO HOLD ONTO HOPE THAT THEIR

2341
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
OWN CHILD MIGHT HAVE BEEN

2342
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
ONE OF THEM.

2343
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I WANT TO END ON THIS, GENE.

2344
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I KNOW YOU SAID IN THE

2347
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
YOU KNOW THE PARENTS ARE

2348
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
COMFORTING THEIR FRIENDS,

2349
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN

2350
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000

2359
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
>> WELL, IT IS WHAT KEEPS ME

I WANT TO TELL THEM THAT

2369
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
THERE IS LIGHT AFTER THE

2370
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
DARKNESS.
I WANT TO READ TO THEM.

2371
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I WANT TO READ A BOOK TO

2372
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000

I WANT TO BE WITH THEM.

2373
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I WANT TO GIVE THEM A

01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000

THEY WILL BE IN MY HEART

2378
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
FOREVER AND EVER.

2379
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I PRAY THAT THEIR PARENTS

2380
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000

2381
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000

YOU PROVIDED SAFETY, A

2386
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
STUFFED ANIMAL.

2387
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
A PLACE OF WARMTH AND SAFETY

2388
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
WHEN THEY HAD COME FROM

2389
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT

2390
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
MOMENTS EARLIER.

2391
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A

2392
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
BACKGROUND IN PSYCHOLOGY AND

2393
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
YOU SAID YOUR DEGREE DID NOT

2394
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

2395
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
IT WAS YOUR GRANDKIDS,

2396
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
SEEING YOUR OWN GRANDKIDS

2397
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
FACES IN YOUR MINDS, THAT IS

2398
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
WHAT TAUGHT YOU EVERYTHING

2399
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

2400
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
GENE ROSEN, GOD BLESS YOU.

2401
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND

2402
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000

01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
>> THANK YOU, MEGYN.

2404
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
MEGYN: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

2405
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
MEGYN: ONE INCREDIBLE GUEST

2406
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
GENE ROSEN WAS AND WHAT AN

2407
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
INCREDIBLE STORY AND PART OF

2408
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
HIS STORY WE DIDN'T GET TO

2409
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
ON CAMERA ABOUT HOW ONE OF

2410
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
THE LITTLE GIRLS WHO WAS

2411
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
WITH HIM IN THAT HOUSE

2412
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
REALLY DIDN'T SAY MUCH THE

2413
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
ENTIRE TIME BUT CLUTCHED

2414
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
ONTO A STILL STUFFED

2415
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
DALMATION HE GAVE HER AND

2416
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
STARED OUT THE WINDOW THE

2417
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
WHOLE TIME LOOKING FOR HER

2418
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
PARENTS WHO CAME TO GET HER.

2419
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
AFTER OUR INTERVIEW ENDED OF

2420
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
MR. ROSEN.

2421
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
THE GRAND PARENT OF THAT

2422
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
LITTLE GIRL WENT OVER TO HIM

2423
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
ON CAMERA, THAT OUR CAMERAS

2424
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
SHOT THAT WE ARE NOT GOING

2425
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
TO SHOW BECAUSE IT WAS A

2426
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
PRIVATE MOMENT BUT THE TWO

2427
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
MEN SHARED SOMETHING

2428
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
SPECIAL.
WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL THAT

2429
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
THOSE CHILDREN MADE IT OUT

2430
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
ALIVE.
WE NEED TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD

2431
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
A LITTLE BIT.

2432
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO DO

2433
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
THAT AS YOU KNOW ON THIS

2434
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
BROADCAST IS "KELLY'S COURT".

2435
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000

2436
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000

AND ON THE DOCKET TODAY, A

2438
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
MICHIGAN MAN FACING JAIL

2439
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
TIME AFTER HE TRIED TO MAKE

2440
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
A CITZENS' ARREST OF A

2441
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
POLICE OFFICER.

2442
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
THE MAN, APPARENTLY LOSING

2443
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
IT AFTER HE SAYS HE SAW THE

2444
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
COP DRIVING WITHOUT A

2445
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
SEATBELT ON AND THAT IS NOT

2446
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
ALL.

2447
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
LISTEN.
>> YOU ARE REQUIRED BY LAW

2448
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
TO WEAR YOUR SEATBELT.

2449
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
PUT YOUR DAMN SEATBELT ON.

2450
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
PULL IT OVER! PULL YOUR

2451
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
VEHICLE OVER! YOU UNDERSTAND

2452
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
RIGHT NOW! WHO THE HELL DO

2453
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
YOU THINK YOU ARE.

2454
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
PULL YOUR [BLEEP] OVER!.

2455
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
MEGYN: THE MAN BEHIND THE

2456
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
ATTEMPTED CITZENS' ARREST IS

2457
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
SET TO GO TO TRIAL ON THIS

2458
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
TWO MONTHS FROM NOW.

2459
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
NO PLEA DEAL COULD BE

2460
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
REACHED BUT HE HAS BEEN

2461
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
CHARGED WITH RECKLESS

2462
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
DRIVING.
JOINING ME NOW, DAVID WE'LL,

2463
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
FORMER PROSECUTOR AND

2464
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND RYAN

2465
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
CLAYPOOL THE SAME.

2466
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
GENTLEMEN.
>> GOOD MORNING, MEGYN.

2467
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
MEGYN: THIS MAN IS VERY

2468
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
UNHAPPY.
VERY UNHAPPY.

2469
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
HIS NAME IS STEVEN McCLAIN.

2470
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
HE IS 60 YEARS OLD.

2471
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
AND HE SAYS THE COP WAS

2472
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
VIOLATING ALL SORTS OF LAWS

2473
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
AND SO BRIAN, DID HE HAVE

2474
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
THE RIGHT TO TRY TO MAKE A

2475
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
CITZENS' ARREST?

2476
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
>> MEGYN, WAIT A MINUTE.

2477
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
THERE IS A NEWS FLASH.

2478
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
THE VERDICT ACTUALLY CAME

2479
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
IN.

2480
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
THE JUDGE FOUND HIM GUILTY

2481
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
AND SENTENCED HIM TO 30 DAYS

2482
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
IN MY 7-YEAR-OLD LITTLE

2483
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
GIRL'S ETIQUETTE AND MANNERS

2484
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
CLASS.

2485
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
THAT IS PROPER SENTENCE.

2486
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
MEGYN: HE IS ONLY KIDDING.

2487
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
THEY'RE GOING TO TRIAL WHICH

2488
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
IS NUTS.

2489
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
THAT IS NUTS.

2490
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
HE IS CHARGED WITH RECKLESS

2491
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
DRIVING.
HE SHOWS UP THE OTHER DAY

2492
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
FOR COURT HEARING.

2493
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
THEY'RE GOING TO TRIAL.

2494
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
THEY'RE HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

2495
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
THE GUY ACCUSING THE COPS.

2496
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

2497
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
BACK TO THE LEGAL ISSUE, NO,

2498
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
HE CAN'T MAKE A CITZENS'

2499
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
ARREST.
I CHECKED THE MICHIGAN

2500
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
STATUTE.
THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN MAKE A

2501
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
CITZENS' ARREST, MEGYN, IF

2502
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
IS FELONY IS COMMITTED IN

2503
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
YOUR HOUSE OR SEE A FELONY

2504
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
BEING COMMITTED IN THE

2505
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
PUBLIC OR A POLICE OFFICER

2506
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
ASKS YOU TO ASSIST IN

2507
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
APPREHENDING A SUSPECT.

2508
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
NONE OF THOSE THINGS

2509
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
HAPPENED HERE.
HE HAD NO RIGHT TO CARRY OUT

2510
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
A CITZENS' ARREST.

2511
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
MEGYN: SO WHAT, DAVID?

2512
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
THE POLICE CAN DRIVE WITH

2513
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
IMPUNITY AND ACCORDING TO

2514
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
MR. McCLAIN THE COP WAS

2515
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
SPEEDING, WASN'T WEARING HIS

2516
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
SEATBELT AND WAS ENDANGERING

2517
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
A K-9, A DOG WHO WAS IN THE

2518
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
BACK OF HIS VEHICLE.

2519
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
>> THIS MR. McCLAIN IS

2520
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
LOOKING OUT FOR THE FOLKS,

2521
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
MEGYN, IN THIS CASE LAW

2522
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
ENFORCEMENT.
HE HAS TREMENDOUS CONCERN

2523
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
FOR THEIR SAFETY.
LOOK, WAS THIS A LITTLE

2524
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
OVERZEALOUS?

2525
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
YES.

2526
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
THANKFULLY HE DIDN'T DO A

2527
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
PIT MANEUVER.

2528
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
HE DIDN'T LAY DOWN SPIKE

2529
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
STRESS.
HE USED HIS CAMERA.

2530
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
YOU THINK THIS HAD SOMETHING

2531
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
TO DO WITH A YOUTUBE MOMENT

2532
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I GUESS?
MEGYN: NO.

2533
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
>> MICHIGAN THERE IS

2534
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
RECKLESS DRIVING AND

2535
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
CARELESS DRIVING.

2536
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
WAS HE ENGAGING IN RECKLESS

2537
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
DRIVING ENDANKING SAFETY OF

2538
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
OTHERS AND HIMSELF?

2539
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

2540
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
WAS IT CARELESS?

2541
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
POSSIBLY.

2542
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
MEGYN: I DON'T THINK HE WAS
LOOKING FOR A YOUTUBE

2543
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
MOMENT.

2544
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
THE REPORTS SAY THIS GUY

2545
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
DRIVES AROUND TAKING

2546
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
PICTURES OF COPS NOT WEARING

2547
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
SEATBELTS.
HE HAS 30 OR 60 OTHER

2548
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
INSTANCES DOING THIS.

2549
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I CAN'T REMEMBER NUMBER.

2550
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
THIS IS REAL ISSUE FOR HIM.

2551
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
LISTEN HOW ANGRY HE IS IS.

2552
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
PLAY SOUND BITE NUMBER ONE.

2553
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
>> OKAY.

2554
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
>> WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED

2555
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
GREEN HE TOOK OFF AT SUCH A

2556
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND I

2557
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
COULD SEE IT WAS A K-9 UNIT.

2558
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I WAS CONCERNED FOR THE

2559
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
POSSIBILITY OF A DOG BEING

2560
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
INSIDE.

2561
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I SAID, SIR, YOU NEED TO

2562
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
WEAR YOUR SEATBELT.

2563
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
HE STARTED LAUGHING.

2564
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
THAT SET ME OFF.

2565
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I WAS MAD AS HELL.

2566
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
MEGYN: SO I MEAN, BRIAN,

2567
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
