CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN WHO

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AND THEN HIT THEM EACH 3 TO 11

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
TIMES.
>> THAT'S THE MEDICAL

281

EXAMINER'S ASSESSMENT.

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HE SAID THIS IS WHAT THESE

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED.

284
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
CLOSE-UP WOUNDS NOT EVERYONE

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAS SUFFERED THE CLOSE-UP

287
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WOUNDS.
THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY A

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
QUICK THING THAT HAPPENED

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AROUND HIS ROOM.

290
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

EACH WITH ALL OF THESE

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
DIFFERENT BULLET WOUNDS.
HE SAID IT WAS A LONG RIFLE

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THAT WAS USED.

294
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR SOME

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
OF THE OTHER WEAPONS THAT WE

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ALSO HEARD MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN
WORKING TO CLEAR UP THAT HOW

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MANY WEAPONS WERE THERE?

300
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SOME OF THE WEAPONS AT LEAST

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
TO THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THAT'S ALL COMING INTO

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CLARITY.
>> CLEAR NOW THAT THE MAIN

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
MURDERING WEAPON WAS THE

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ASSAULT RIFLE?
>> EXACTLY.

306
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICINE CALL

307
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
EXAMINER SAID SAID TODAY HE

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BELIEVES IT WAS A LONG RIFLE.

309
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THAT LEAVES OTHER QUESTIONS AS

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
TO WHAT WERE THESE GUNS DOING

311
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND THE GUNS AT THE HOME AS

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WELL.

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> STILL NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AUTHORITIES SAID THERE IS SOME

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
EVIDENCE.
THEY AREN'T SAYING WHAT OR

317
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
GIVE THEM DETAILS THAT WILL

318
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LEAD THEM TO THE HOW AND WHY.

319
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THEY THINK THEY ARE ON THE

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
RIGHT PATH OF GETTING SOME

321
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
INFORMATION ALONG THOSE LINES.

322
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> NO WORD ON A NOTE LEFT

323
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
BEHIND BY THE PERPETRATOR.

324
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> NO WORD AT ALL ON A NOTE AT

325
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
ALL.
>> SO WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BE THE

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
DEVIL'S SPAWN.

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BECOME

329
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SO EVIL, SO WICKED, SO

330
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
DEPRAVED AS TO TAKE THESE

331
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
LIVES.
>> ANY ANSWER OF WHY STILL

332
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN THE

333
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SENSELESSNESS.

THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SOME PARENTS WERE ELATED AND

559
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
RELIEVED AND OTHER PARENTS ARE

560
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CRUSHED AND SCARED.

561
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I MEAN, HOW WILL THIS

562
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
COMMUNITY DEAL WITH THAT?

563
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THAT'S WHAT MY BROTHER IS

564
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
GOING THROUGH.

565
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
LIKE CHRISTMAS DAY FOR HIM AND

566
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
HELL FOR OTHERS.

567
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED AND

568
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HAPPY WITH MY NEPHEW'S WELL

569
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
BEING, THERE WERE PARENTS THAT

570
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
DON'T HAVE THAT SAME FORTUNE.

571
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AND IT TEARS OUR HEART APART

572
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
TO HAVE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT

573
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
THAT CLOSE SO CLOSE TO

574
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
CHRISTMAS.

575
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
IT RIPS AT MY HEART.

576
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE THAN

577
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THAT.

578
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ELATED.
FAMILY GOING THROUGH A LOT

579
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
RIGHT NOW.
THEY WILL BE GETTING

580
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
COUNSELING FOR THEIR SON

581
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
BECAUSE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS,

582
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THOSE THINGS THAT COME TO

583
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
PLAY.
THEY WILL PULL TOGETHER LIKE

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THIS COMMUNITY.
THIS IS ONE HECK OF A TOWN

585
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THIEVES THESE PEOPLE ARE

586
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
GREAT.

587
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
THE FIBER OF THIS COMMUNITY

588
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WAS WOKEN UP BY THE DEVIL

589
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
HIMSELF.
THIS TOWN WILL RISE UP AGAIN.

590
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
IT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO.

591
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THESE PEOPLE STICK TOGETHER.
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS

592
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
WAS AN ANGEL IN THE CHRISTMAS

593
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
PAGEANT THAT ONE OF THE

594
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
CHURCHES DOWNTOWN.

595
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ALL OF HAVING VARIOUS

596
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
MEMORIALS.
YOU WORKED IN HOSPICE CARE.

597
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
IT'S ALMOST IF THIS WHOLE TOWN

598
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
NEEDS HOSPICE CARE.

599
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

600
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
HOSPICE CARE USUALLY INVOLVES

601
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING AT OLD

602
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
AGE.

603
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I WRKD WITH THEM WHEN I WAS 12

604
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
YEARS OLD.

605
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
DIFFERENT WORKING WITH PARENTS

606
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
WHOSE CHILD ISN'T SUPPOSED TO

607
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
BE DEAD.

608
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
FAMILIES WHOSE CHILD ISN'T

609
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

612
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS

613
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
INCIDENT SO MUCH DIFFERENT

614
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THAN ANY OTHER HOSPICE

615
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
INCIDENT OR LOSING A LOVED ONE

616
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
FOR CANCER, YOU KNOW, AT AN

617
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
OLD AGE.

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
BUT THE DEBATE DEFINITELY

619
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
NEEDS TO INCORPORATE THAT.
I THINK OBAMA IS RIGHT ON

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THAT NOT A BIPARTISAN ISSUE.

621
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
>> Geraldo: GET BACK TO 9/11.

622
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
POINT THAT MORE CHILDREN DIED

623
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HERE TODAY OR FRIDAY THAN DIED

624
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
IN THE 9/11 ATTACKS.

625
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THE CHILDREN FEWER THAN DIED

626
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ON THE AIRCRAFT.

627
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
>> WHEN I HEARD THIS

628
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
YESTERDAY.
IT KEPT MIRRORING WHAT I SAW

629
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
PALM SUNDAY WITH THE 10 KIDS

630
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD.

631
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THIS IS MORE PERSONAL THAN

632
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
9/11.
THAT WAS CRAZY.

633
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL MISHAP ABOUT

634
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
RELIGION.

635
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
HERE COULDN'T BE A MOTIVE NO

636
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
MOTIVE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN

637
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR THESE POOR

638
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.

639
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN COWERING

640
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
TOGETHER THIS PUNK GOING IN

641
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THERE AND CONTINUOUSLY

642
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
SHOOTING THESE KIDS.

643
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THIS CAN'T BE A MOTIVE.

644
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
WHEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT MADE

645
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
THIS GUY DO, THIS I WANT TO

646
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
KNOW AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

647
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
IT COULD BE ANY CONNECTICUT.

648
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
>> DIFFERENT QUIET, NICE KID,

649
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
GOOD KID.

650
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
CHALLENGES IN THAT HOUSE.

651
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
EVERY FAMILY HAS ONE, I HAVE

652
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
ONE, THEY HAVE ONE.

653
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

654
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH

655
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
ANYTHING.

656
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES WITH

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
SCHOOL SHE WOUND UP HOME

658
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
SCHOOLING HIM.
SHE BATTLED THE SCHOOL

659
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
DISTRICT.
I'M NOT 100% CERTAIN IF IT WAS

660
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
BEHAVIOR OR LEARNING

661
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
DISABILITY, I REALLY DON'T

662
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
KNOW.
IS HE A VERY VERY BRIGHT BOY.

663
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
HE WAS SMART.

664
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

665
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
NEPHEW SHE CALLS A BRIGHT BOY.

666
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
A YOUNG MAN WHO BECAME A

667
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
MONSTER, WHO COMMITTED A

668
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
MONSTROUS ACT SMALL

669
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
PICTURESQUE CONNECTICUT TOWN

670
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
FOREVER MORE WILL BE

671
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ASSOCIATED NOW SADLY WITH THE

672
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
MASSACRE OF THE LITTLE FIRST

673
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
GRADE KID.
THEIR PRINCIPAL, THEIR SCHOOL

674
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND OTHER ADULTS

675
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE

676
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
CHILDREN ALL SLAUGHTERED BY

677
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THAT YOUNG MAN TURNED MONSTER

678
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ADAM LANZA.

679
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
MIKE TOBIN IS NEAR THE HOME

680
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHARED WITH

681
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
HIS MOTHER NANCY WHO WAS THE

682
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
FIRST TO FALL FROM ORGY OF

683
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
VIOLENCE.

684
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
TELL US FIRST OF ALL, SINGLE

685
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
MOM, DIVORCED, TELL US A

686
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LITTLE BIT.

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> THEY WERE DIVORCED IN 2009

688
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
AFTER 17 YEARS OF MARRIAGE

689
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THIS MAY VERY WELL END UP

690
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PLAYING A ROLE.

691
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
INDICATIONS THAT BOTH OF THE

692
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SONS WERE TRAUMA ADVERTISED BY

693
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
THIS DIVORCE.

694
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND YOU HAD RYAN, THE OLDER

695
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
SON GO OFF TO THE UNIVERSITY.

696
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AND THEN ADAM WAS LEFT ALONE

697
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT HIS

698
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
BROTHER, WITHOUT HIS FATHER.

699
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT A LOT

700
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OF CONTACT WITH HIS FATHER.

701
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
NOT A BAD HOME BUT PRETTY

702
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
ROUGH ON THE TWO SONS ONCE

703
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THAT FAMILY SPLIT UP.

704
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> MIKE, WHAT ABOUT THIS

705
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
NOTION THAT THE MOTHER WAS A

706
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SURVIVALIST?

707
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD ALL THESE

708
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
WEAPONS INCLUDING THE 223 BUSH

709
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
MASTER A WEAPON WHO ARE SUITED

710
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
FOR WAR THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

711
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
WALLS SHE A SURVIVALIST?

712
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING MORAL

713
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
IS THAT SHE HAD THE GUNS

714
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BECAUSE SHE LIVED IN THAT BIG

715
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
HOUSE PRACTICALLY BY HERSELF.

716
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SHE WAS THERE WITH THE ONE SON

717
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AS WE TALKED ABOUT

718
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.

719
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD THE GUN.

720
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE WAS PROUD OF HER GUN

721
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
COLLECTION.
RESTAURANT BAR HERE LOCALLY

722
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
THAT SHE WOULD -- I WOULDN'T

723
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
SAY FREQUENT.

724
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WASN'T A BIG DRINKER.

725
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
SHE WOULD GO IN FROM TIME TO

726
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TIME AND SHE WOULD BOAST ABOUT

727
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
HER GUN COLLECTION.

728
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
SHE WAS QUITE PROUD THROUGH

729
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SOME THE REPORTING THROUGH

730
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
REUTERS THAT A LANDSCAPER CAME

731
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THROUGH THERE AND SHE HAD

732
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE GUNS

733
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
AND TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT HOW

734
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OFTEN SHE WOULD TAKE THE KID

735
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
OUT SHOOTING, GERALDO.

736
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
>> Geraldo: YOU MENTIONED THE

737
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER ALLEGED

738
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THIS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA

739
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HAD.
WAS HE?

740
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
WAS HE NOT AUTISTIC?

741
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
IS THAT CONFIRMED?

742
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> IT ISN'T CONFIRMED.

743
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE

744
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
STATE POLICE.
WE HAVE HEARD MENTION OF AS

745
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
BERGER SYNDROME A FORM OF

746
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AUTISM.
THAT REALLY GETS TRACED BACK

747
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO THE OLDER BROTHER RYAN

748
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
REPORTEDLY WHAT HE SAID TO THE

749
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
POLICE.
OTHER THAN THAT A LOT OF

750
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
PEOPLE KNEW HIM AND SOMETHING

751
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
GOING ON WITH THAT CHILD --

752
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THAT YOUNG MAN WHO IS INVOLVED

753
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IN THIS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ACT

754
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THAT HE WAS VERY WITHDRAWN.

755
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SOMETIMES HE WOULD WITHDRAW TO

756
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
THE POINT WHERE HE WAS NO

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
LONGER FUNCTIONAL IN SCHOOL.

758
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SCHOOL.

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
PEOPLE WOULD SEE HIM IN THE

760
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
HALLWAYS.

761
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
HE WOULDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT.

762
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HE WOULD PULL BACK AND CLUTCH

763
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HIS BRIEFCASE HE WOULD CARRY

764
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
WITH HILL.
HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD

765
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DESCRIBED HIM AS A NERD

766
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING

767
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
IS HE HE WAS BRILLIANT WITH

768
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
COMPUTERS.
HE WAS KIND OF SLIGHT OF

769
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
BUILD, WALKED AROUND WITH A

770
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
POCKET PROTECTER AND THAT'S

771
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WHERE YOU GET THAT KIND OF

772
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
LABEL AND HE CERTAINLY HAD

773
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
SOME SOCIAL PROBLEMS AT THE
SAME TIME.

774
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HE DID HAVE GIFTS IN TERMS OF

775
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WORKING WITH COMPUTERS.

776
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000

777
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
DR. KEITH ABLOW JOINS US NOW.

778
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
DR. KEITH IS AS YOU KNOW ON

THE FOX NEWS MEDICAL A TEAM.

780
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
SO, DR. ABLOW, WHAT ABOUT --

781
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
FIRST OF ALL, I NEVER HEARD OF

782
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AUTISM OR AS BERGERES BEING

783
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE.

784
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
ARE WE SLANDERING THOSE WHO

785
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
HAVE THIS DEVELOPMENTAL

786
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DISABILITY?

787
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
USING IT IN THIS CONTEXT.

788
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> GERALDO, BY AND LARGE AS

789
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
BERGER'S SYNDROME AND AUTISM

790
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

791
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

792
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THESE KIDS CAN BE

793
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SELF-ABUSIVE.
THEY CAN BE VIOLENT AT TIMES

794
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE KIND HE METHODICAL

795
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
PLANNING INVOLVED HERE.

796
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THE VIOLENT USE OF WEAPONS,

797
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THE ABILITY TO TAKE THESE

798
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THINGS FROM HIS MOTHER TO KILL

799
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HIS MOTHER TO SAMINGLY PLAN

800
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEM IS NOT TYPICAL OF THAT

801
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME

802
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
EXPLANATION OTHER THAN THOSE

803
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
DIAGNOSES.

804
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SO, IN THAT WAY, YES, WE ARE

805
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
DOING A DISSERVICE BECAUSE

806
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHAT

807
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
HAPPENED HERE.

808
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
IT'S ANOTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL OR

809
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER OR SET OF

810
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SYMPTOMS.

811
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
>> I KNOW A LOT OF GUN

812
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
COLLECTORS THEY USUALLY DON'T

813
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
COLLECT WEAPONS BIKE THE BUSH

814
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
MASTER THE GLOCK, THE SIG SO

815
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
YOUIER.
THESE WEAPONS ARE WEAPONS OF

816
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
SEVERE VIOLENCE.

817
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
THESE ARE AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS,

818
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
PARTICULARLY THE CIVILIAN

819
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
VERSION OF THE M-4.

820
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

821
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IF SHE WASN'T A SURVIVALIST,

822
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WHAT WAS SHE.

823
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW

824
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
BECAUSE WE NEED MORE

825
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
INFORMATION.
AND PEOPLE CAN COLLECT ANY

826
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
GUNS THEY WANT.

827
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SHE MAY HAVE HAD ALL KINDS OF

828
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
REASONS FOR WANTING THOSE

829
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AROUND.

830
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
WHY SHE WOULD GIVE HER SON

831
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
ACCESS TO THEM AND NOT HAVE

832
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THEM LOCKED UP WHEN IS HE A

833
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
TROUBLED YOUNG MAN AND SHE

834
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
KNOWS THAT HE IS WITHDRAWN AND

835
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
HAS SEVERE DIFFICULTIES,

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

837
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK YOU

838
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO

839
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SAFEGUARD THOSE THINGS FROM AN

840
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
AEMOTIONALLY DISTURBED YOUNG

841
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
MAN.
DID YOU GET HIM THE HELP IN

842
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
ABSOLUTELY EVERY WAY THAT HE
NEEDED FROM A SYSTEM BY THE

843
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WAY, THE MENTAL HEALTHCARE

844
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
SYSTEM WHICH IS A NATIONAL

845
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
EMBARRASSMENT, A TRAVESTY.

846
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
ALL BUT DOESN'T EXIST.

847
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SO, WE WILL SEE MORE OF THIS

848
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
UNTIL WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT

849
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
CREATING A MENTAL HEALTHCARE

850
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
SYSTEM IS AMERICA THAT CAN

851
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUTLIERS,

852
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
PARTICULARLY THOSE BROKEN TO

853
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
VIOLENCE.

854
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WE DO NOT HAVE THAT SYSTEM NOT

855
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
EVEN CLOSE I'M TELLING YOU I'M

856
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
A VISTA.

857
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
D-MINE NEWS GRADE IN AMERICA

858
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
AS TO THE MENTAL HEALTHCARE

859
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SYSTEM.
>> I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT

860
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THAT AND TALK MORE ABOUT IF

861
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
YOU SEE SOMETHING, SOMEONE

862
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
BEHAVING IN ABERRANT WAY YOU

863
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

864
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I KNOW IT'S A CLICHE.

865
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR Y'ALL

866
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WHEN WE COME BACK.

867
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
WHAT ABOUT MY IDEA THAT THERE

868
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
SHOULD BE A COP.

869
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

870
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WITH THE SAME VIGOR WE PROTECT

871
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
OUR GOLD, OUR BANKS, WE SHOULD

872
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
HAVE AN ARMED COP AT EVERY

873
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SINGLE SCHOOL OVER A CERTAIN

874
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
SIZE?

875
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THE KIDS WILL GET USED TO THE

876
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
COP.

877
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
IT WILL BE LIKE OFFICER CRUMP

878
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
CAN

879
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
CRUMPKE.

880
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP SAFE.

THE SURVIVORS AMONG CHILDREN

882
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
AND PARENTS HAVE THEIR OWN

883
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
CROSSES TO BEAR GOING FORWARD

884
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
TO CHRISTMAS AND BEYOND.

885
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HOW WILL THEY COPE?

886
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
AND ONE WAY OF LOOKING HOW THE

887
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
FAMILIES OF THE SLAIN CHILDREN

888
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000

SAY WAS FREQUENTLY BULLIED BUT

WHICH WE HAD OF THE OFFENDER

995
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
IS THAT HE IS QUITE A LONELY

996
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
PERSON.

997
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
HE HAS A GREAT SOCIETY.

998
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND OUT OF EXTREME OPINIONS

999
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000

IS OVERRATED.

1005
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO

1006
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
NEWTOWN.
>> WE WERE JUST IN THE MIDDLE

1007
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
OF GYM WHEN WE HEARD SOME

1008
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
GUNSHOTS AND THEN THE PAIR

1009
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
WENT OUT AND THE GYM TEACHERS

1010
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
DIRECTED US TO STAY AGAINST

1011
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
THE WALL AND EVERYBODY STARTED

1012
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
KIND OF PANICKING.

1013
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
WE HEARD A LOT MORE GUNSHOTS

1014
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
AND THE AMBULANCE CAME.

1015
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
THEN THE POLICEMAN DIRECTED US

1016
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TO RUN OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

1017
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

1018
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
>> THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE IN

1019
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
1999 MADE US ALL UNDERSTAND

1020
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE NO LONGER

1021
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
SAFE HAVENS.

1022
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
BETH LOST HER DAUGHTER RACHEL.

1023

COLORADO.

1025
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BETH, FOR

1026
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
BEING WITH US.

1027
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
>> HOW DO YOU EVER HEAL FROM

1028
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1029
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
>> IT TAKES A LONG LONG TIME.

1030
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I DESCRIBED IT AS BEING HIT BY

1031
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
A FREIGHT TRAIN AND YOU DON'T

1032
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
EVEN KNOW HOW HARD YOU HAVE

1033
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
BEEN HIT.

1034
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
AND FOR YEARS YOU CAN WALK

1035
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
AROUND WITH THE PAIN AND

1036
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
BROKENNESS OF THAT.

1037
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
AND BUT, YOU KNOW, IT COMES

1038
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
AND GOES.

1039
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
AND FOR US, IT WAS A VERY LONG

1040
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
HEALING PROCESS.

1041
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
BUT WE DID ACTUALLY BECOME

1042
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
STRONGER FOR IT.

1043
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AND SOME GOOD THINGS HAVE COME

1044
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OUT OF IT.

1045
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
AND ALL THE TALK ABOUT EVIL,

1046
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
EVIL SHOWED ITS FACE THAT DAY

1047
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT

1048
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE OUT OF

1049
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
LOSING RACHEL, WE ALSO GAINED

1050
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
A PLATFORM FOR MUCH GOOD.

1051
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
FIRST OF ALL FOR OUR FAITH,

1052
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
WHICH SUSTAINED US DURING THIS

1053
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
TIME AND ALSO FOR PROGRAMS AND

1054
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A LOT OF SPEAKING REGARDING

1055
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
COMPASSION AND KINDNESS AND

1056
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

1057
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES AND YOUTH

1058
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PROGRAMS TO DO THAT AND THAT

1059
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BROUGHT SOME HEALING.

1060
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
BUT IT IS A VERY LONG LONG

1061
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
PROCESS.

1062
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF

1063
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THE TUNNEL, BUT THE PARENTS

1064
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW,

1065
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN

1066
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
EVEN SEE A GLIMMER OF HOPE

1067
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
BECAUSE OVERWOMENNING DESPAIR

1068
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
OF THEIR LOSS.

1069
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
AND MY HEART IS VERY HEAVY FOR

1070
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THEM BECAUSE I KNOW THE ROAD

1071
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRAVEL

1072
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
FOR MANY MONTHS AND YEARS IS

1073
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
GOING TO BE VERY HARD AND

1074
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
DIFFICULT ROAD I BELIEVE THEY

1075
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
WILL MAKE IT AND I BELIEVE THE

1076
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
COMMUNITY HAS ALSO SHOWN

1077
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
ITSELF TO BE STROCK AND

1078
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
RESILIENT.
AND ONE THAT WILL.

1079
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
>> STRONG AND RESILIENT?

1080
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
>> YES.

1081
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
>> IT'S A VERY BIG BURDEN.

1082
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE,

AWFUL WOUND BUT THANK YOU FOR

BEING WITH ME.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1096
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
CONNECTICUT WAS A GODLESS ACT,

1097
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
REGARDLESS OF YOUR RELIGION,

1098
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
OR YOUR LACK OF RELIGION.

1099
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
WE ARE ALL UNITED IN OUR

THOSE WHO SUFFERED MOST.

1102
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
EGREGIOUSLY HERE.
WE WILL TALK TO SOMEONE WHO IS

1103

1104
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
AFTER THIS.

1105
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
[ Male Announcer ]
WE ALL MAKE BAD DECISIONS.

1106
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
LIKE SAY, GAS STATION SUSHI.

1107
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
CHEAP IS GOOD.
AND SUSHI, GOOD.

1108
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
BUT CHEAP SUSHI, NOT SO GOOD.

1109
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
