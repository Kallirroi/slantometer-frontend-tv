LIVES LOST.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S BEEN

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TRULY INSPIRING TO SEE THE WAY

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
THE COMMUNITY HAS COME

ANOTHER.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
TERRIBLE.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I FRANKLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000

>> Bill: TONIGHT WHAT HAPPENED?

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HOW IT COULD HAPPEN AND CAN

AMERICA PREVENT THIS KIND OF

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000

MASS MURDER IN CONNECTICUT,

UNSPEAKABLE EVIL ON DISPLAY.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THERE IS LITTLE ANYONE CAN SAY

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WHEN 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
MURDERED.
THAT KIND OF THING DIMINISHES

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND DEEPLY

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AFFECTS ALL GOOD PEOPLE.

SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THEN HE ENTERED TWO CLASSROOMS,

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
KILLING THE CHILDREN.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
FOUR OTHER ADULTS DIED AS WELL.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000

RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO KNOWN

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
MOTIVE AND WE WON'T BE GETTING

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ANY EXPLANATION FROM LANZA WHO

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THE SCHOOL.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THIS IS THE WORST SCHOOL

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
SHOOTING EVER IN CONNECTICUT.

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SECOND WORST IN THE UNITED

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
STATES BEHIND VIRGINIA TECH.

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
HERE ARE SOME SCENES IN THE

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AFTERMATH OF THIS APPALLING

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
CRIME.
>> EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
TODAY.

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
(SIRENS).

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
>> A CALL CAME IN TO DISPATCH.

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
POLICE OFFICERS AND RESOURCES

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
FROM ALL OVER THE STATE RACED TO

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THAT AREA AS THEY CONVERGED ON

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE SCHOOL.

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SHAKEN.
THEY WERE CRYING IN THE CLOSET.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING, THE

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
POLICE MADE THEM HOLD HANDS AND

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
TOLD THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> THE GYM TEACHERS DIRECTED US

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TO STAY AGAINST THE WALL.

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
EVERYBODY STARTED KIND OF

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PANICS.
>> THERE IS NO WORDS.

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
IT'S SHEAR TERROR.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
>> DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> WE ALL HUDDLED AND I KEPT

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HEARING THESE BOOMING NOISES.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> I JUST SAW ALL THESE MOMS

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
NETWORKING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THE KIDS WERE TERRIFIED!

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THEY WERE TERRIFIED.

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THEY HAD JUST WITNESSED

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SOMETHING AND THEY WERE

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TERRIFIED.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> MOST TRAUMATIZING THING I'VE

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
EVER BEEN TO.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
>> MY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE BROKEN

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WOUNDS.

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> Bill: THREE GUNS WERE FOUND

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AT THE SCENE.
TWO PISTOLS AND A RIFLE.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
POLICE SAY THEY WERE LEGALLY

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
PURCHASED AND REGISTERED TO

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LANZA'S MOTHER WHO AGAIN WAS

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
APPARENTLY MUMPEDDED BY HIM.

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WITH US NOW, GERALDO RIVERA.

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BETWEEN US, WE PRETTY MUCH SEEN

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WHAT THERE IS TO SEE IN THIS

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WORLD, BUT THIS KIND OF EVIL HAS

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
GOT TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
CHART.
>> YOU KNOW, BILL, I'VE BEEN EYE

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
TO EYE WITH CHARLES MANSON.

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'VE BEEN A WAR CORRESPONDENT

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FOR SEVEN YEARS, I COVERED THE

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WORSE ATROCITIES OF IRAQ AND

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AFGHANISTAN.

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER.

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I HAVE A SCENE IN MY MIND THAT I

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF MY MIND.

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HE HAD THE THREE WEAPONS.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HE HAD THE GLOCK AND THE SIX

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HOUR, BOTH .9 MILLIMETER, THE

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
223 BUSH MASTER.

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
USED IT.

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
MOST REPORTS ARE SUGGESTING HE

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
LEFT THAT ONE IN THE CAR, WHICH

157
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
MEANS HE WENT INTO THE SCHOOL,

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
GETS PAST SECURITY, GETS INTO

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE CLASSROOM, ONE OR TWO

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
CLASSROOMS AND STARTS FIRING AT

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THE LITTLE CHILDREN.

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
AT SOME POINT HE HAS TO RUN OUT

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OF AMMUNITION.

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
EVEN IF HE HAS EXTENDED

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
MAGAZINES, AT SOME POINT HE HAS

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
TO RELOAD.

167
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
SO THE SCENE I HAVE IN MY MIND

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
IS THESE BABIES, BETWEEN THE

169
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AGES OF FIVE AND TEN, AS THIS

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
GROWNUP -- THESE ARE CHILDREN

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN EVIL.

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE FLOWER OF INNOCENCE.

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
HERE IS A GROWNUP DRESSED IN

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
CAMO AND BULLET PROOF VEST AND

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HE'S GOT TWO HAND GUNS AND HE

177
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
STARTS KILLING THE CHILDREN AND

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CHILDREN

179
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SCREAMING AND THEN HE'S

180
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
RELOADING AND THERE IS THE DEAD

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
CHILDREN AND THERE IS THE

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
CHILDREN YET TO BE KILLED.

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
IN THIS MOMENT, JUST IMAGINE THE

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TERROR BEFORE HE KILLS THEM.

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
IT IS SO UNCONSCIONABLE.

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
IT IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION.

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IT IS SO EVIL DOESN'T DO IT.

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN SUFFICIENTLY

189
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THE WICKEDNESS, THE DEPRAVED

190
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WRECKLESS INDIFFERENCE TO THE

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN, JUST

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SOMETHING AS THAT FATHER OF
FIVE, I CANNOT GET OUT MIFF

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
MIND.
>> Bill: NOBODY CAN.

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR IT.

195
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IT IS EVIL.

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT'S WHAT IT

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
IS.
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

198
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THIS THAT HAPPEN AND WHY THEY

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
HAPPEN SO MUCH IN THE UNITED

200
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
STATES, YOU KNOW.

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WE SAW THE NORWEGIAN THING LAST

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
YEAR AND ALL OF THAT.

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BUT IT'S A GOOD COUNTRY, BUT

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THERE IS INSANITY.

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THERE IS STRAIN OF INSANITY NOW

206
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
RUNNING THROUGH OUR COUNTRY.

207
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
WE'LL GET TO THAT A LITTLE

208
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
LATER.
YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO THE

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
CONCENTRATION CAMPS, YOU KNOW?

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
YOU BEEN THERE, RIGHT?

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> THAT'S WHAT IT MOST REMINDS

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ME OF.
>> Bill: I'VE BEEN THERE.

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
>> A MINI HOLOCAUST.

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> Bill: GO TO THE CONCENTRATION

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
CAMPS AND GO TO CAMBODIA AND

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THEY STILL HAVE THE SKULLS, IF

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN GO SEE

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THEM, AND YOU GO TO CHINA AND

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
VARIOUS PLACES.

221
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
IT ALL COMES BACK TO ONE THING.

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
IT ALL COMES BACK TO THERE IS AN

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
EVIL IN THE UNIVERSE AND YOU

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
CAN'T STOP IT.

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
YOU CAN'T STOP IT.

226
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WE JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> THIS YOUNG MAN, ADAM LANZA,

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WOKE UP AND HE KILLED HIS

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MOTHER.

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WHY DID HE KILL HIS MOTHER?

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
MAYBE HE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER WAS

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
CHILDREN.
MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING AS --

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> Bill: WE DON'T WANT TO

237
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SPECULATE TONIGHT.

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> AS CRAZY AS THAT.

239
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AFTER SHE'S DEAD, HE THEN DRIVES

240
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TO HER CLASSROOM.

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HOW BEST TO SAVAGE YOUR MOTHER

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAN TO GO AND KILL THE CHILDREN

243
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SHE CARED FOR, THAT SHE

244
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
NURTURED, THAT SHE TAUGHT.

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
AND MY BROTHER CRAIG WAS THERE

246
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
ALL DAY.

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HE SAW A SCENE WHERE ALL THE

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
PARENTS COLLECTED THEIR

249
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
CHILDREN, THE SURVIVING

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
CHILDREN, AND THE GOVERNOR AT

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SOME POINT SAYS, THOSE WHO

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
HAVEN'T COLLECTED THEIR

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
CHILDREN, THERE ARE NO MORE

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CHILDREN TO COLLECT.

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THEY ARE INSIDE, THE FORENSICS

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ARE STILL ONGOING.

257
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THEY WERE AT THE FIRE HOUSE.

258
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SO THERE WERE FAMILIES ARRIVING

259
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
LATE.

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SOME COMING FROM OUT OF TOWN.

261
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THE SCHOOL WAS ALMOST A MAGNET

262
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD AND

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PARENTS COMING DUR COURSE

264
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
OF THE AFTERNOON.

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HE SAW A SCENE WHERE THE PARENTS

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WERE TAKING THE CAR SEAT OUT OF

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THE BACK SEAT AND PUTTING IT IN

268
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE TRUNK, NEVER TO BE USED

269
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
AGAIN.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- I

270
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
MEAN, I DON'T THINK THERE IS A

271
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PERSON LISTENING RIGHT NOW, A

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
PARENT WHO CAN'T JUST BE SO JUST

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
DEFEATED, DEFLATED, OUTRAGED,

274
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
SICKENED, DISGUSTED --

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> Bill: AND THE WORST PART OF

276
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
IT IS, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ABOUT IT.
THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO.

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> THE OTHER BITTER IRONY IS

279
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THAT THIS HEROIC PRINCIPAL, DAWN

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
HOCKSPRUNG IMPLEMENTED SECURITY

281
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AT THE SCHOOL.
SHE PUT A BUZZER SYSTEM IN THE

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
SCHOOL THAT HE APPARENTLY BURST

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THROUGH TO GET TO THE --

284
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> Bill: IF HIS MOM TAUGHT

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THERE, THEY KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW

286
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HOW TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL.

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
>> I WANT AN ARMED COP AT EVERY

288
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
SCHOOL.
I REMEMBER THERE WERE TWO SCHOOL

289
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SHOOTINGSINGS AND WERE THERE WEE

290
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AMISH KIDS IN PENNSYLVANIA.

291
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
AND THEN I SAID, WE HAVE TO

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
PROTECT THESE CHILDREN AS IF

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THEY WERE GOLD.

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AS IF THEY WERE THE MATERIAL YOU

295
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
USE FOR ATOM BOMBS, YOU HAVE TO

296
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
PROTECT THE CHILDREN.

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> Bill: I KNOW THAT ALL OVER

298
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW,

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000

IN HEIGHTENED SECURITY FOR ALL

301
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000

I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE SPOKEN

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WITH A NUMBER OF FEDERAL

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
INVESTIGATORS, ONE OF WHOM, A

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SEASONED INVESTIGATOR, ONE OF

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THE BIGGEST, TOUGHEST GUYS I

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
KNOW, AND HE WAS SHOCKED AS HE

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
RELATED THE NEWS TO ME.

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE DETAILS OF THIS HORRIFIC

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
CRIME.
WHEN YOU HEAR FROM LAW

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
ENFORCEMENT THE HORROR AT WHAT

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
TRANSPIRED, IT REALLY BRINGS IT

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
HOME.
THE FACT THAT THIS KID, WOULD

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
SHOOT HIS OWN MOTHER IN HER HOME

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AND THEN DRIVE TO THE SCHOOL

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
WHERE SHE APPARENTLY WORKED AND

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
SLAUGHTERED CHILDREN, IT'S

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ALMOST TOO HORRIFIC TO BELIEVE.

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
>> Bill: WE GET OUR REPORTS FROM

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HUNDREDS OF

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SHOTS WERE FIRED BY THIS GUY AND

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
HE HAD PLANNED IT OUT.

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY HE HAD TAKEN

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THREE WEAPONS WITH HIM.

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
BUT THERE IS NO MUCH ELSE KNOWN

355
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY,

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
OBVIOUSLY HIS MOTHER, CHILDREN,

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
NOTHING MATTER TO DO HIM AT ALL.

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000

THE SCHOOL?

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
DID THEY TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
SPECIFICALLY HAPPENED?

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000

PROCESS THAT SCENE.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER IS INSIDE

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
THE SCHOOL AT THIS HOUR

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ATTEMPTING TO WORK THROUGH THE

372
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODIES,

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
INCLUDING THOSE 18 CHILDREN

374
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
STILL IN THE SCHOOL.

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THAT COULD BE FINISHED, THEY

376
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
HOPE BY TOMORROW, BILL.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
BUT WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THROUGH

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THAT THE

379
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
BROTHER OF THIS SHOOTER, RYAN

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
LANZA, WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
AS THE SHOOTER, MAYBE BECAUSE

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS CARRYING

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
HIS I.D
HE HAS SPOKEN WITH FEDERAL

384
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AUTHORITIES AND DESCRIBED AS

385
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
VERY COOPERATIVE.

386
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
HE'S TELLING FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
THAT HE BELIEVES HIS BROTHER HAD

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
DEVELOPED MENTAL PROBLEMS AND

389
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
POSSIBLY AUTISM, AND THE BOY'S

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
FATHER ALSO SAID TO BE

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
COOPERATING WITH FEDERAL

392
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
AUTHORITIES IN NEW JERSEY, BEING

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
QUESTIONED, TRYING TO SHED LIGHT

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
ON THIS KID'S MENTAL STATE AND

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
WHAT MAY HAVE SET HIM OFF.

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
SO THEY HAVE THE FATHER AND THE

398
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
BROTHER WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY TRYING

399
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
TO EXPLAIN TO AUTHORITIES THE

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
CONDITION OF THE DEAD MURDERER.

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WHEN YOU COVER A STORY LIKE

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THIS, THERE IS A LOT OF CHAOS

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
AND THERE IS A LOT OF

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
MISREPORTING, AS YOU JUST

405
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
MENTIONED, THE KID RYAN, WE JUST

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
SAW, THE BROTHER, WAS INITIALLY

407
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
TIED IN TO THE CRIME, BUT NOW

408
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
HE'S BEEN TOTALLY EXONERATED,

409
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
RIGHT?
THERE IS JUST ONE SHOOTER.

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
THEY BELIEVE IT'S ONE MAN WHO

411
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
DID THESE HORRIBLE THINGS.

412
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
IS THAT CORRECT?

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
>> CORRECT.
YEAH.
BILL, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, IN THE

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
AFTERMATH OF A MAJOR INCIDENT

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
LIKE THIS, THERE IS A LOT OF

416
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
CONFUSION.
IN THIS CASE, IF THE SHOOTER WAS

417
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
CARRYING AN IDENTIFICATION, THEN

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THAT WOULD LEAD INVESTIGATORS TO

419
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
PREVIOUS THAT WAS HIM.

420
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
APPARENTLY IT WAS HIS BROTHER.

421
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
HIS OLDER BROTHER.

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THIS KID IS 20.

423
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
HIS BROTHER IS 24.

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
HE MAY HAVE HAD HIS I.D. ON HIM

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
FOR PURPOSES OF WHO KNOWS?

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
ALCOHOL.
WHO KNOWS?

427
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
>> Bill: I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

428
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THE SHOOTER WHO IS NOW DEAD, WAS

429
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
CARRYING HIS BROTHER'S I.D

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
THAT'S THE I.D. THEY FOUND ON

431
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HIM.

432
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AND HIS BROTHER AND THE FATHER

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
LIVE IN NEW JERSEY, NOT CLOSE TO

434
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THE SCENE.
ALL RIGHT.

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
RICK.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
DIRECTLY AHEAD, A THIRD GRADER

438
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
SURVIVES THE MURDER.

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
WE WILL TALK WITH HER AND HER

440
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MOTHER.
LATER PRESSURE GROWING ON MEXICO

441
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
TO RELEASE A FORMER MARINE THEY

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PUT IN PRISON ON BOGUS CHARGES.

443
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THOSE REPORTS AFTER THESE

444
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
MESSAGE

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
>> Bill: IN THE IMPACT SEGMENT,
NO WORDS CAN CONSOLE THE

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
FAMILIES OF THE DEAD CHILDREN IN

447
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
CONNECTICUT.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
NO WORDS.

449
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THERE WERE MORE THAN 600

450
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
CHILDREN IN THE SANDY HOOK

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
SCHOOL TODAY.

452
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THE SURVIVORS WILL CARRY THIS

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
CRIME WITH THEM FOREVER.

454
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
JOINING US FROM NEWTOWN, BRENDA

455
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
AND HER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

456
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
SOPHIA, THIRD GRADER AT THE

457
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
SCHOOL.

458
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
SOPHIA, YOU OKAY TONIGHT?

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
YOU ALL RIGHT?

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
>> YES.

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
>> Bill: CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
YOU SAW TODAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO

462
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
YOU AT SCHOOL TODAY?

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
>> WELL, WE WERE AT MORNING

464
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
MEETING AND THEN WE HEARD THESE

465
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
KNOCKING SOUNDS AND THEN MISS

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
MARTIN, SHE CLOSED THE DOOR AND

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
LOCKED IT AND THEN TOLD US TO GO

468
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
IN THE CORNER AND THEN WE WERE

469
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
LIKE SHAKING AND EVERYBODY WAS

470
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
ALL SQUISHED.

471
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
>> Bill: DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

472
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
HAPPENING OUTSIDE YOUR

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
CLASSROOM?

474
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
DID THE TEACHER TELL YOU

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ANYTHING?

476
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
>> NO.
>> Bill: SO YOU WERE JUST SCARED

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND YOU

478
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
KNEW THE TEACHER WAS CONCERNED?

479
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
>> YES.
>> Bill: HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF

480
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
THE SCHOOL, SOPHIA?

481
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
>> WELL, SOMEONE WAS KNOCKING

482
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
DONE THE DOOR AND OUR ASSISTANT,

483
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
SHE LOOKED OUT THE DOOR AND IT

484
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
WAS THE POLICE TO TELL US TO

485
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
COME OUT.

486
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
SO WE WENT OUT AND WENT TO THE

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
FIRE HOUSE.

488
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
>> Bill: OKAY.

489
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
ABOUT THIS?
DOES SHE UNDERSTAND IT?

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I MEAN, THIS IS SO TRAUMATIC FOR

492
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
EVERYONE.
ADULTS ARE BREAKING DOWN.

493
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
HOW IS SOPHIA DEALING WITH IT

494
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WITH YOU?

495
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
>> I THINK SHE'S STILL NUMB.

496
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
SHE HAS HER FAMILY AROUND HER.

497
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
MY SISTER CAME UP, SO I THINK

498
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION

499
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
HASN'T HIT HER YET.

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
SHE WASN'T REALLY EXPOSED TO ANY

501
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
OF THE BODIES OR ANYTHING.

502
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THEY TOOK HER OUT A BACK DOOR.

503
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
>> Bill: THAT'S GOOD.
>> THEN WENT TO THE FIRE HOUSE.

504
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
>> Bill: DID YOU KNOW ANY OF THE

505
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED?

506
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
DID SOPHIA KNOW THEM?

507
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I THINK THEY WERE YOUNGER,

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
RIGHT?
>> THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY IN

509
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
KINDERGARTEN.

510
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ANY OF THE

511
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CHILDREN'S NAMES.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

512
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I DO KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS THAT

513
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'VE TALKED TO, THEIR CHILDREN

514
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ARE SAFE.

515
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I MADE SURE OF THAT.

516
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
ANYBODY I SAW IN THE FIRE HOUSE,

517
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I HUGGED THEM.

518
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
AND I SAID DO YOU HAVE YOUR

519
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
BABIES?

520
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
AND THEY SAID YES, WE'RE OKAY.

521
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER WHEN -- GO

522
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
AHEAD.
>> Bill: SANDY HOOK IS A VERY,

523
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
VERY CALM PLACE, NEWTOWN,

524
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
CONNECTICUT, A BEAUTIFUL SUBURB.

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
>> OH, YEAH.

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
>> Bill: NO VIOLENCE TO SPEAK

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
OF.
>> SAFE.
>> Bill: THIS WOULD BE THE LAST

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
PLACE ON EARTH YOU WOULD THINK

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
AT THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

531
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ABOUT THIS AND WHAT WAS YOUR

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
REACTION?

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> OKAY.

534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I WAS HOME DOING MY CHRISTMAS

535
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
CARDS ON-LINE AND I RECEIVED A

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
PHONE CALL FROM THE SCHOOL

537
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
SUPERINTENDENT THAT WE USUALLY

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
GET IF THERE IS GOING TO BE AN

539
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
EARLY DISMISSAL, YOU KNOW,

540
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, SAYING

541
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING IN

542
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
NEWTOWN AND THAT THE SCHOOLS

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WERE ON LOCKDOWN.

544
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
BUT SHE DID NOT SAY THAT THERE

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
WAS A SHOOTING AT ONE OF THE

546
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SCHOOLS.
SO I WASN'T THAT CONCERNED UNTIL

547
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM -- I

548
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THINK IT WAS A.P. NEWS ON MY

549
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
PHONE SAYING THAT THERE WAS A

550
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SHOOTING IN THE SANDY HOOK

551
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
SCHOOL ON DICKINSON.

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THAT'S WHERE MY DAUGHTER

553
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ATTENDS, SO I JUMPED IN THE CAR.

554
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I WENT TO THE SCHOOL.

555
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THERE WAS ALREADY PARENTS THERE

556
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
CRYING AND I SAW A FRIEND OF

557
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
MINE.
I SAID WHAT HAPPENED?

558
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
AND THEY WERE HYSTERICAL THAT

559
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THEY CARRIED OUT A LITTLE GIRL

560
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AND SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS

561
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DEAD.
I PANICKED.

562
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
BUT LUCKILY I SAW MY DAUGHTER

563
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
RIGHT AWAY COMING WITH HER

564
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TEACHER, 'CAUSE THEY STARTED

565
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
WALKING THE KIDS FROM THE SCHOOL

566
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TO THE FIRE HOUSE, WHICH IS

567
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ALMOST ADJACENT TO THE SCHOOL.

568
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
>> Bill: BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE

569
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SCHOOL HANDLED THE SITUATION

570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WELL AND THE POLICE AND THE

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
AUTHORITIES DID A GOOD JOB.

572
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW?

573
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> YES.

574
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
ABSOLUTELY.

575
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> Bill: SO EVERYBODY WAS

576
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
REASSURED QUICKLY?

577
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
YOU SAY YOU PANICKED, BUT

578
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
EVERYTHING WAS CONTAINED.

579
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> THE CHILDREN WERE BEING

580
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ORDERLY, TAKEN TO THE FIRE

581
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
HOUSE.
THEY WENT INTO A LARGE ROOM.

582
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF CRYING.

583
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
BUT THE TEACHERS SEEM TO KEEP

584
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THE KIDS CALM AND WE KEPT EVERY

585
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
CLASSROOM WAS KEPT TOGETHER, SO

586
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THE TEACHER KNEW WHERE HER KIDS

587
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
WERE.

588
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
AS THE PARENTS CAME IN, YOU

589
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
KNOW, SHE'S OVER HERE, YOU KNOW.

590
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
SHE'S OKAY.

591
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WE HAD NO IDEA THE GRAVITY OF

592
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THE SITUATION UNTIL LATER ON

593
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WHEN I CAME HOME AND I HEARD THE

594
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
NEWS.
I HEARD THAT THE PRINCIPAL WAS

595
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
SHOT AND THE LITTLE GIRL THAT I

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
WAS TOLD THAT WAS TAKEN OUT

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
BLOODY.
BUT WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE

598
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WOULD BE 20 SOME ODD PEOPLE

599
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
KILLED.
>> Bill: DID YOU KNOW THIS

600
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TEACHER WHOSE SON DID THIS

601
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ALLEGEDLY AND WOUND UP DEAD?

602
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
DID YOU KNOW HER?

603
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
>> I NEVER HEARD HER NAME

604
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BEFORE.

605
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN.

606
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THEY DON'T KNOW THE BOYS.

607
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SHE'S NOT LISTED ON THE

608
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DIRECTORY IN SCHOOL AS A

609
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

610
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I DO KNOW THAT THEY STARTED A

611
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
PRESCHOOL HERE THIS YEAR.

612
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS A

613
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
PRESCHOOL TEACHER.

614
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>> Bill: BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

615
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
OKAY.

616
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
>> NO.
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SOPHIA, WE APPRECIATE YOU

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
TELLING US YOUR STORY AND WE

619
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
HOPE YOU'RE OKAY AND MISS

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
LABINSKI, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

621
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
YOU LET US KNOW.

622
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH

623
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THIS.
>> THANK YOU.

624
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
>> Bill: PLENTY MORE AS "THE
FACTOR" MOVES ALONG THIS

625
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
EVENING.
EVIL PEOPLE, CAN WE PROTECT

626
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OURSELVES AGAINST THEM?
WE'LL TALK WITH TWO MENTAL

627
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
HEALTH WORKERS.

628
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
AND THEN MARINE CORPORAL JON

629
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
HAMMER STILL IN A MEXICAN

630
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
PRISON.

631
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WE'RE TRYING HARD TO GET HIM

632
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OUT.
WE HAVE HOPE YOU STAY TUNED FOR

633
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THOSE

634
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
>> Bill: UNRESOLVE PROBLEM
SEGMENT, HOW SHOULD WE PROCESS

635
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
EVIL AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
IT?

637
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
JOINING US FROM BOSTON,

638
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
PSYCHOTHERAPIST DR. KAREN RUSKIN

639
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
AND KANSAS CITY, DR. RUSSELL,

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
FORENSIC SCIENTIST AND ATTORNEY.

641
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
COULD EVIL LIKE THIS EVER BE

642
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
DEALT WITH EFFECTIVELY,

643
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
DR. RUSSELL?

644
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
>> WELL, BILL, YOU CAN'T

645
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
ELIMINATE IT, BUT YOU CAN

646
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
MINIMIZE IT BETTER THAN WE'RE

647
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
DOING.
NOT JUST BY ENHANCED SECURITY

648
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
PRACTICES.

649
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
A COUPLE BIG THINGS, BILL, ONE

650
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
IS WE CAN RETHINK OUR

651
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION POLICY

652
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
WHERE BY FAR TOO OFTEN WE

653
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
ACTUALLY SHOW MORE COMPASSION

654
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
FOR AN OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUSLY

655
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
TROUBLED INDIVIDUAL THAN WE DO

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
FOR EVERYBODY IN THE SOCIETY

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THAT THAT PERSON MAY HARM.

658
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
AND SECONDLY, WE CAN GET BACK TO

659
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
BEING THE KIND OF A CULTURE IN

660
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WHICH KIDS GROW UP GETTING LOTS

661
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
OF MESSAGES AT HOME, SCHOOL,

662
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
CHURCH, EVERYWHERE ABOUT BEING

663
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
PART OF SOMETHING LARGER THAN

664
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THEMSELVES.
THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF

665
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
THEIR ACTIONS ON OTHERS BECAUSE

666
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WE'VE BECOME COARSENED AND

667
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
CALLUS TO THE POINT THAT A KID

668
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
CAN GROW UP IN THIS SOCIETY AND

669
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
NOT NECESSARILY INTERNALIZE THE

670
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
KIND OF DISGUST THAT YOU AND I

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
FEEL, THIS VISCERAL DISGUST FOR

672
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THE KIND OF DISREGARD FOR HUMAN

673
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
LIFE THAT WE SAW TODAY.

674
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
>> Bill: DR. RUSKIN, IT SEEMS TO

675
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
ME THAT THERE IS CASUAL VIOLENCE

676
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
AND VERY EXPLICIT VIOLENCE ON

677
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
DISPLAY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
AND THAT'S, OF COURSE, THANKS TO

678
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
THE INTERNET.

679
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS

680
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
HAVING AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

681
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
ON A GENERATION OF AMERICANS.

682
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY THAT.

683
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
BUT CERTAINLY THE CASUAL

684
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
VIOLENCE IS ON DISPLAY FAR MORE

685
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THAN ANY OTHER TIME IN HISTORY.

686
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
AM I WRONG?

687
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
>> I WOULDN'T YOU ARE NOT WRONG.

688
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AND WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT

689
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT ABSOLUTELY

690
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
AFFECTS US.

691
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
WE MUST VIEW THINGS

692
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SYSTEMICALLY.

693
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
WE ARE A SYSTEM L IT'S

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
TELEVISION, WHETHER IT'S PARENTS

695
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
BEING TOO BUSY TO SPEND QUALITY

696
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TIME WITH THEIR KIDS, WHETHER A

697
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
KID IS HURTING AND ANOTHER CHILD

698
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
IS MEAN ABOUT THAT, WHETHER

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
TEACHERS ARE NOT NOTICING,

700
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
WHETHER PARENTS ARE NOT NOTICING

701
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF THEIR

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
KIDS.
EVERYTHING AFFECTS EVERYTHING.

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THE VIOLENCE THAT WE'RE

705
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
EXPERIENCING IS SYSTEMIC AND WE

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
NEED TO PUT A STOP TO IT BY

707
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
EVERYBODY PLAYING A ROLE,

708
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
PARENTS, VERY IMPORTANT.

709
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE IT ALL

710
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
STARTS, AT A YOUNG AGE.

711
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

712
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SO BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

713
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
LEGISLATE GOOD PARENTING,

714
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
DR. RUSSELL.
THAT'S A PROBLEM ON ALMOST EVERY

715
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
SOCIOLEVEL THAT WE HAVE IN

716
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
AMERICA.
I MEAN, FAMILIES FALL APART.

717
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
FATHERS ABANDON CHILDREN,

718
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
MOTHERS ABUSE CHILDREN, WHATEVER

719
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IT MAY BE, THEN THE CHILDREN

720
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SUFFER.
SO IN A FREE SOCIETY, YOU'RE

721
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE

722
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE AND YOU'RE

723
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE EVIL.

724
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ALWAYS.
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

725
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
UNDERSTAND -- MY MOTHER, FOR

726
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
EXAMPLE, DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

727
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EVIL.

728
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
WHEN I WOULD TELL HER, HEY, MOM,

729
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I WAS IN EL SALVADOR AND I SAW

730
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
NUNS GET SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE

731
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
HEAD, SHE ALMOST COULDN'T

732
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
PROCESS IT.

733
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SHE COULDN'T PROCESS IT.

734
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
YOU KNOW.

735
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE

736
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AMERICANS REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

737
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CONCEPT OF EVIL.

738
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT

739
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IT EXISTS.

740
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
IT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE

741
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
ABSOLUTELY ARE PEOPLE, THEY MAY

742
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
NOT BE MENTALLY HEALTHY, THEY'RE

743
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SANE AND THEY CHOOSE TO HURT

744
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
OTHERS JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

745
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
AND WE HAVE TO WRAP OUR MINDS

746
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
AROUND THAT AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE

747
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
CAN'T MAKE EVERYBODY PARENT THE

748
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
WAY THAT THEY SHOULD.

749
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
SOCIETY IS NOT SQUANDER CHANCES

750
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WHEN WE GET THEM TO INTERVENE

751
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
BECAUSE THE PERSON HAS GIVEN US

752
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
REASON TO, HAS SHOWN A

753
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
PROPENSITY TO BE DANGEROUS.

754
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I PREDICTED IN THIS THING, WE'RE

755
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
GOING TO FIND OUT THERE WERE

756
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SIGNS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

757
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
>> Bill: THERE USUALLY ARE.

758
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
THERE ARE USUALLY SIGNS.

759
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ALTHOUGH A TED BUNDY, THE SERIAL

760
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
KILLER, TRACKED THAT GUY ALL

761
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OVER THE UNITED STATES,

762
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
NOBODY -- I TALKED TO HIS

763
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
MOTHER.
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS A

764
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
MONSTER WHO WOULD LOOK A WOMAN

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
IN THE EYE AND THEN CUT HER

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THROAT BECAUSE HE CAME ACROSS AS

767
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THIS PREPPY, REGULAR GUY.

768
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
BUT SOCIOPATHS AND NARE CITY

769
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
CYSTS, I THINK THIS IS GROWING

770
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
IN OUR SOCIETY.

771
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I THINK THAT THIS DISEASE, THIS

772
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
MENTAL ILLNESS OF SOCIOPATHY IS

773
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
GROWING AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

774
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS A

775
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

776
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PSYCHOPATH AND THE SOCIOPATH.

777
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THE PSYCHOPATH, THEY DON'T CARE

778
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
EVEN IF IT'S THEIR FAMILY THAT

779
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
THEY'RE HURTING.

780
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THERE IS NO REMORSE.

781
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THERE IS NO GUILT.

782
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WHEREAS A SOCIOPATH MAY OR MAY

783
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
NOT FEEL GUILTY OVER HURT AGO

784
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
FAMILY MEMBER, BUT THEY SURE AS

785
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
HECK DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT

786
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
HURTING SOMEBODY ELSE.

787
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AND THE PSYCHOPATH CAN APPEAR

788
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
VERY LOVELY TO OTHERS, WHEREAS

789
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
THIS SOCIOPATH OFTEN YOU CAN

790
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
TELL THAT THERE IS A

791
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
DISTURBANCE, AND I BELIEVE THAT

792
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
IN OUR CULTURE, AS WE HAVE

793
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
BECOME SO SELF-ABSORBED AND

794
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
SELF-TITLED THAT WE DESERVE TO

795
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
HAVE LOVING PARENTS, I DESERVE

796
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
NOT TO FEEL HURT, I DESERVE TO

797
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HAVE MONEY.

798
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I DESERVE HAVE A JOB.

799
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
YES, YES.

800
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
EVERYBODY DESERVES.
BUT THE FACT IS, WE CAN NOT

801
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
CONTROL THE CARDS THAT ARE DEALT

802
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
TO US.
SO RATHER WE MUST WORK HARD

803
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
EVERY DAY IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH

804
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
AND WELLNESS AND WELL-BEING AND

805
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
IF WE'RE NOT FEELING WELL, WE,

806
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE, WE, I MUST TAKE OWNERSHIP OF

807
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
MY OWN BEHAVIOR AND SEEK OUT

808
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HELP.
>> Bill: THAT'S A MATURE MIND.

809
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
YOUR POINT ABOUT WE ALL FEEL WE

810
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DESERVE ALL THIS AND IF WE DON'T

811
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
GET IT, SOME OF US GO INTO A

812
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
RAGE AND SOME OF US LOSE IT AND

813
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
START TO INFLICT DAMAGE I THINK

814
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A GOOD ONE.
BUT ONLY A MATURE MIND WILL SAY,

815
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I NEED HELP.

816
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
DOCTOR, I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU

817
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THE LAST WORD IN KANSAS CITY.

818
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT, THERE

819
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
IS NO SOLUTION TO EVIL.

820
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WE JUST HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT, I

821
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THINK.
>> TWO THINGS.

822
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
DON'T CALL IT AN ILLNESS BECAUSE

823
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THIS, WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

824
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
TONIGHT TRANSCENDS PSYCHOLOGY.

825
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
EVERYBODY WATCHING TONIGHT HAS

826
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
TO DECIDE WHAT TO CALL IT.

827
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I CALL IT EVIL.
YOU CALL IT EVIL.

828
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND,

829
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
YOU DO A LOT ON THE CULTURE WAR.

830
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE CULTURE

831
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THAT'S DRIFTING IN A DIRECTION,

832
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE THOSE

833
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE ON THE

834
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
FRINGES OF IT ANYWAY DRIFTING

835
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
EVEN FARTHER OUT OF THE BOUNDS.

836
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
>> Bill: ALLALL RIGHT.

837
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.

838
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, FORMER MARINE

839
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNJUSTLY IMPRISONED IN MEXICO.

840
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WILL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BE

841
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF JAIL?

842
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WE'LL HAVE THE VERY LATEST ON A

843
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
VERY TROUBLING STORY.

844
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THEN WE WILL GO BACK TO THE

845
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
CRIME SCENE IN CONNECTICUT.

846
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS WITH

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
BILL HEMMER AND "THE FACTOR"

848
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000

849
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000

HE'LL START INVESTING EARLY,

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
HE'LL FIND SOME GOOD PEOPLE

WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

861
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

862
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

863
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000

WE'LL GO BACK TO CONNECTICUT

866
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
SHORTLY.
BUT FIRST IN "THE FACTOR"

867
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
FOLLOW-UP TONIGHT, THE TALKING

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
POINTS MEMO.

869
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
MEXICO INSULTING EVERY SINGLE

870
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

871
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
27-YEAR-OLD JON HAMMER, FORMER

872
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
MARINE LANCE CORPORAL FROM

873
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
FLORIDA, REMAINS REMAINS IN A MN

874
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
PRISON CHARGED WITH GUN

875
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
POSSESSION.
THE CHARGE IS TOTALLY BOGUS.

876
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
LAST SUMMER HE REGISTERED AN

877
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
ANTIQUE SHOTGUN, HANDED DOWN TO

878
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
HIM FROM HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER

879
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
WITH AMERICAN CUSTOMS OFFICIALS

880
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS.

881
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
HE WAS THEN TOLD BY THE AMERICAN

882
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AGENTS TO TAKE THE PAPERWORK

883
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
ACROSS THE BORDER TO MEXICAN

884
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
OFFICIALS AND HE WOULD BE FINE

885
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
TO TRAVEL ON TO COSTA RICA FOR A

886
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
HUNTING TRIP.

887
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
WHEN HE DID CHECK IN WITH THE

888
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
MEXICANS IN MATAMOROS, HE WAS

889
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
PROMPTLY ARRESTED AND CHARGED

890
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WITH CARRYING A DEADLY WEAPON.

891
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
THAT WAS LAST AUGUST.

892
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS BY THE

893
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
U.S. GOVERNMENT TO GET HIM

894
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
RELEASED, MEXICO WILL NOT DO IT.

895
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
SO HE SITS IN A FILTHY PRISON

896
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
TEN DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

897
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THAT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.

898
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS CORPORAL HAMMER

899
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DID NOTHING WRONG.

900
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
SO WHY DOESN'T MEXICO JUST

901
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
RELEASE HIM IN THE NAME OF

902
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
GOODWILL?
FOR YEARS TALKING POINTS HAS

903
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
BEEN TELLING YOU THAT MEXICO

904
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
DOES NOT ACT LIKE A FRIEND TO

905
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THE USA.

906
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'VE STOPPED GOING TO THE
COUNTRY 'CAUSE THEY DO NOT -- I

907
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
DO NOT BELIEVE THEY'RE LOOKING

908
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
OUT FOR US.

909
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THE JON HAMMER CASE PROVES THIS.

910
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
MEXICO'S NEW PRESIDENT SHOULD

911
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
RELEASE HAMMER IMMEDIATELY.

912
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
RIGHT NOW.

913
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
WE UNDERSTAND HIGH LEVEL

914
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
NEGOTIATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE

915
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
AND THERE IS SOME OPTIMISM THE

916
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
CORPORAL WILL SOON BE FREE.

917
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
BUT WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG?

918
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
AND HOW DID IT EVER HAPPEN IN

919
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THE FIRST PLACE?

920
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
WE WILL STAY ON THE STORY.

921
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
THAT'S A MEMO.

922
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
NOR FOR REACTION, JOINING US

923
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
FROM WASHINGTON, CONGRESSWOMAN

924
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
WHO IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE

925
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
CASE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

926
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

927
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
YOU CAN HAVE SOMEBODY IN JAIL

928
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
FOR FOUR MONTHS WHO DIDN'T DO

929
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY IS

930
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
INVOLVED, THE STATE DEPARTMENT,

931
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT KNOWS

932
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
ABOUT THIS.

933
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
SO TRY TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING

934
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
ON.
>> WELL, WE ARE OUTRAGED AS

935
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
WELL, BILL.

936
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
IN FACT, IT IS SO

937
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT WHEN THE

938
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
MOTHER FIRST CAME TO US WITH THE

939
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
CASE, WE SAID, OH, SOMETHING

940
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
MUST BE WRONG HERE.

941
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
SOMETIMES CONSTITUENTS STRETCH

942
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
THE TRUTH A LITTLE BIT.

943
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.

944
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
>> Bill: BUT IT IS.

945
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
>> THE MORE WE INVESTIGATED,

946
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

947
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WE FOUND OUT ABSOLUTELY,

948
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
EVERYTHING THAT SHE WAS SAYING

949
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

950
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
AND, IN FACT, IN MY CONVERSATION

951
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
JUST TWO DAYS AGO WITH THE

952
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MEXICAN AMBASSADOR, HE TOLD ME

953
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THAT RIGHT NOW JON HAMMER IS

954
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
CHAINED TO HIS BED.

955
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
WHY?

956
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MOVE HIM

957
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION OF

958
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THOSE CRIMINALS INTO AN AREA

959
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
THAT IS LESS SECURE.

960
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
AND IN THAT AREA THAT IS LESS

961
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
SECURE, IT IS SO UNSECURE THAT

962
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THEY FEAR THAT HE WILL ESCAPE

963
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
AND IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THAT

964
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
FEAR, THEY HAVE CHAINED HIM TO

965
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
HIS BED.

966
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
>> Bill: DOES THE MEXICAN --

967
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
WHEN YOU TALKED TO THE MEXICAN

968
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AMBASSADOR, DOES HE JUSTIFY

969
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
THIS?

970
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE
POWER TO RELEASE HIM.

971
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I GUESS THE MEXICAN ATTORNEY

972
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
GENERAL WOULD DO THIS.

973
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
BUT DOES HE JUSTIFY THIS TRAVIS

974
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SEE?
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

975
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH

976
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THIS OFFICIAL OR THE OTHER

977
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
OFFICIAL.

978
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, BILL, THE

979
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS PROBABLY

980
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
EVEN GOING TO BE POWERLESS

981
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT
THEY'RE UNDER SIEGE BY THESE

982
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
DRUG LORDS AND THEY HAVE CREED

983
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
CONTROL TO THESE GANGSTERS.

984
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SO THE FOLKS ADMINISTERING THIS

985
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
TERRIBLE PRISON IS NOT THE

986
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, BUT THESE

987
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
DRUG LORDS.
>> Bill: ARE YOU TELLING ME,

988
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
CONGRESSWOMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF

989
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
MEXICO DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH

990
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
POWER TO RELEASE HAD AMERICAN

991
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
FROM THAT FILTHY PRISON IN

992
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
MATAMOROS?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

993
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
>> I BELIEVE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE
GUTS O DO IT.

994
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
DOES HE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO

995
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
IT?

996
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
YES.
>> Bill: OF COURSE HE DOES.

997
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
>> THIS IS A CASE THAT WILL PUT

998
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
HIM TO THE TEST.

999
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THIS IS A COUNTRY WHOSE LEADERS,

1000
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
LEADER AFTER LEADER, THEY LOVE

1001
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
TO LECTURE THE UNITED STATES

1002
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
ABOUT HOW BADLY WE SUPPOSEDLY

1003
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TREAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

1004
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HOGWASH.
HERE IS ANOTHER CASE, BECAUSE IT

1005
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE -- OF AN

1006
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AMERICAN UNJUSTIFIABLY

1007
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
IMPRISONED.
SO WE CALL ON THIS PRESIDENT TO

1008
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
DO HIS DUTY AND RELEASE THIS --

1009
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> Bill: I WANT OUR PRESIDENT TO

1010
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
DO SOMETHING, TOO.

1011
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I WANT BARAK OBAMA TO SPEAK OUT

1012
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ABOUT THIS.

1013
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
HE HAS REMAINED SILENT.

1014
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SO HAS SECRETARY OF STATE

1015
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
CLINTON.
I UNDERSTAND THIS MUCH AND I

1016
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THINK YOU HINTED AT IT.

1017
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WE DON'T WANT TO MUCK UP ANY

1018
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
NEGOTIATIONS THAT MIGHT BE

1019
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
FRUITFUL BY ATTACKING ANYBODY

1020
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
AND CALLING ANYBODY OUT MAKING

1021
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
ANY THREATS.

1022
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THAT INCLUDES PRESIDENT OBAMA

1023
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
AND SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON.
WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME, YOU I'M E

1024
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING

1025
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WHAT THEY SHOULD.
I'M SOAPING THEY ARE DOING WHAT

1026
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THEY SHOULD DO.

1027
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1028
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
>> I DON'T GET THAT FEELING YET,

1029
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
BILL.
MAYBE I'LL GET THAT FEELING --

1030
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
>> Bill: SO YOU WANT MORE

1031
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
PRESSURE PUT ON BY SECRETARY

1032
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
CLINTON AND PRESIDENT OBAMA?

1033
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
DO YOU WANT MORE PRESSURE?

1034
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1035
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
THAT'S WHY I'VE REACHED OUT TO

1036
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
MY CONGRESSIONAL COLLEAGUES,

1037
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
OVER 50 OF THEM HAVE SIGNED A

1038
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
BIPARTISAN LETTER TO HILLARY

1039
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
CLINTON AND JANET NAPOLITANO,

1040
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THE HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

1041
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
CALLING FOR THEIR ADVOCACY FOR

1042
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
JON HAMMER --

1043
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
>> Bill: THEY NEED TO GET OUT IN

1044
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
FRONT OF THIS!

1045
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THE NEWS MEDIA, "THE FACTOR" AND

1046
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
YOU AND SENATOR NELSON, ALTHOUGH

1047
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
HE DIDN'T MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE

1048
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THIS EVENING AND HE SHOULD HAVE,

1049
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN OUT IN FRONT.

1050
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
LOOK, WE'LL GIVE IT THE WEEKEND.

1051
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
WE'LL COME BACK MONDAY.

1052
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE.

1053
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WE'LL KEEP IN CONTACT WITH YOU,

1054
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
CONGRESSWOMAN.
WE GOT TO GET THIS GUY OUT

1055
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

1056
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
>> YOU ARE HIS LIFE POLICY.

1057
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I BELIEVE THAT --

1058
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
>> Bill: WE'LL GET HIM OUT

1059
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
BECAUSE NO AMERICAN IN -- WE'RE

1060
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
GOING TO CALL FOR ABSOLUTE

1061
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
BOYCOTT OF TRAVEL TO MEXICO IF

1062
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
HE'S NOT OUT.

1063
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
SIMPLE AS THAT.

1064
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
>> THANK YOU FOR SAVING HIS

1065
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
LIFE.
WE GOT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

1066
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
PRAYING FOR HIM.

1067
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
>> Bill: WE'RE GOING TO WORK

1068
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE.

1069
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

1070
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
>> THANK YOU, BILL.

1071
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
>> Bill: IN A MOMENT, WE'LL

1072
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
RECAP THAT HORRENDOUS MASS

1073
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
MURDER IN CONNECTICUT.

1074
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
HORRIBLE STORY.

1075
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THAT'S NEXT

1076
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
>> Bill: BACK OF THE BOOK

1077
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
SEGMENT, LET'S GO BACK TO

1078
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1079
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
FOX NEWS ANCHOR BILL HEMMER IS

1080
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
STANDING BY WITH AN UPDATE.

1081
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
ALL RIGHT, HEMMER.

1082
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
WE'RE STARTING TO NOW LEARN A

1083
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

1084
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
INSIDE BY THE SCENE THAT THE

1085
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
POLICE DESCRIBING.

1086
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

1087
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
>> IT IS A SCENE THAT CAN ONLY

1088
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
BE DESCRIBED AS GRISLY AND A

1089
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
SCENE THAT EVEN HARDENED POLICE

1090
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
OFFICERS WORKING THE STATE FOR

1091
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
DECADES HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE

1092
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
IN THEIR LIVES.

1093
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
BILL, WE BELIEVE ALL THE BODIES

1094
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
ARE STILL INSIDE THAT SMALL

1095
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
LITTLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DOWN

1096
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
THE HILL FROM WHERE WE ARE AND

1097
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
THEY WILL NOT BE MOVED TONIGHT

1098
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OR EVEN POSSIBLY TOMORROW OR

1099
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
EVEN INTO SUNDAY.
THIS IS A GRISLY CRIME SCENE AND

1100
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
THE POLICE ARE BEING VERY

1101
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
PARTICULAR ABOUT MAKING SURE

1102
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THAT THEY ARE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS

1103
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
EVIDENCE.

1104
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THIS IS A SCHOOL, BILL.

1105
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
IT'S A TINY PLACE.

1106
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

1107
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
GRATE.
AND YOU COME UP HERE TO THIS

1108
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
TOWN AND YOU THINK THIS IS THE

1109
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
KIND OF COMMUNITY WITH YOU WANT

1110
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
TO SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL.

1111
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
YOU GO DOWN THIS HILL THROUGH

1112
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
THE FOREST AND THE SCHOOL

1113
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
EMERGES THERE, BILL.

1114
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
THERE IS A SHORT LITTLE DRIVEWAY

1115
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
RUNS ABOUT 75 YARDS LEADING UP

1116
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
TO THE PARKING LOT OF THE

1117
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
SCHOOL.
YOU WALK IN THERE AND YOU THINK,

1118
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY

1119
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
GO WRONG HERE?

1120
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
AND TODAY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.

1121
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, THESE POLICE

1122
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
OFFICERS AND THESE INVESTIGATORS

1123
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
ARE WORKING THIS CRIME SCENE TO

1124
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
MAKE SURE THEY GET POSITIVE

1125
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
IDENTIFICATION, SOMETHING THAT

1126
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WE EXPECT AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW

1127
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
EASTERN TIME TO BE ANNOUNCED TO

1128
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

1129
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
>> Bill: OKAY.
WE HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION, THE

1130
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
PRINCIPAL WHO WAS SHOT DEAD BY

1131
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THIS LANZA.
TELL US ABOUT HER.

1132
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO GIVE OUT HER

1133
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
NAME OUT OF RESPECT TO THE

1134
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
COMMUNITY HERE BECAUSE POLICE

1135
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
HAVE NOT GIVEN OUT HER NAME YET.

1136
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
SHE'S 47 YEARS OLD.

1137
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
SHE'S BEEN THE PRINCIPAL FOR TWO

1138
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
YEARS, GOING BACK TO 2010.

1139
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WHICH BY THE WAY, WAS THE LAST

1140
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
YEAR A SERIOUS CRIME WAS EVEN

1141
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
REPORTED IN THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN,

1142
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
CONNECTICUT.

1143
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
SHE HAS FIVE KIDS.

1144
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
TWO DAUGHTERS AND THREE

1145
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
STEPDAUGHTERS, ALONG WITH HER

1146
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
HUSBAND WHOSE FIRST NAME IS

1147
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
GEORGE AND HE, TOO, IS A TEACHER

1148
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
IN THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT.

1149
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
HERE IS THE SAD AWFUL THING

1150
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
ABOUT THIS, BILL.

1151
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
WE'RE JUST GETTING INTO THE

1152
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

1153
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
EVERY HOUR, THESE LAYERS PEEL

1154
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
AWAY.

1155
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
WE'RE GOING TO MEET THESE
VICTIMS IN A VERY INTIMATE WAY

1156
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
OVERT COMING DAYS AS WE MOVE

1157
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
THROUGH THE FUNERALS AND IT'S

1158
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
ONLY GOING TO MAKE US MORE AND

1159
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
MORE SAD AS WE WORK THROUGH IT

1160
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
BECAUSE THESE LIVES HAVE BEEN

1161
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
LOST AND WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT

1162
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
PEOPLE LIKE IT WOMAN WHO WAS A

1163
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
MOTHER OF FIVE AND BASED ON THE

1164
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
POLICE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE, THE

1165
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
GUNMAN WALKED IN THE PRINCIPAL'S

1166
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
OFFICE FIRST AND COUNTED AT

1167
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
LEAST FOUR ADULTS, ALL OF WHICH

1168
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WE BELIEVE, ALL OF WHOM WE

1169
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
BELIEVE WERE WOMEN, INCLUDING

1170
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THE PRINCIPAL, AND SHOT THEM

1171
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
DEAD ON SITE AT THAT MOMENT.

1172
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
>> Bill: IT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND

1173
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
ANY OF THIS, OF COURSE.

1174
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO

1175
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THE

1176
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
SURVIVORS AND THERE WERE OVER

1177
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
600 KIDS IN THE SCHOOL.

1178
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I MEAN, IT'S A SMALL SCHOOL, BUT

1179
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
THERE ARE A LOFT KIDS THERE.

1180
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE

1181
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
AFFECTED FOR THE REST OF THEIR

1182
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
LIVES.

1183
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
YOU DON'T KNOW -- YOU DON'T KNOW

1184
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HOW PERSONALITIES ABSORB THAT.

1185
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
SO NOT ONLY ARE THE DEAD AND

1186
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
GRIEVING FAMILIES WITH THEIR

1187
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE, BUT ALL OF

1188
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THE OTHER CHILDREN, WE JUST

1189
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
TALKED TO ONE EARLIER IN THE

1190
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
PROGRAM, WHO LOOKED -- I DON'T

1191
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
KNOW WHETHER YOU SAW THAT, BUT

1192
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
SHE LOOKED LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M

1193
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
EIGHT YEARS OLD AND WHAT AM I

1194
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
DEALING WITH HERE?

1195
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
NEVER GOES AWAY.

1196
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
IT NEVER GOES AWAY.

1197
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
SO THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO

1198
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR

1199
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THOSE PEOPLE AND AS YOU SAID,

1200
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
IT'S GOING TO UNFOLD AND NOW WE

1201
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
HAVE A WOMAN WITH FIVE CHILDREN

1202
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT

1203
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
OF THOSE STORIES.

1204
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
>> YEAH.
ONE THING TO ADD ON THAT, I MET

1205
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
IN A YOUNG GIRL BEFORE SHE

1206
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
TALKED TO YOU, SOPHIA.

1207
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
SHE WAS SO CHARMING.

1208
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
SHE HAD A HUGE SMILE ON HER

1209
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
FACE.

1210
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I MEAN, YOU LOOK IN HER PARENTS'

1211
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
EYES AND YOU CAN SEE THE TEARS

1212
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
IN THEIR EYES AND THEY TRY AND

1213
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
FIGHT IT BACK.

1214
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THEY HAVE THEIR DAUGHTER FOR

1215
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
CHRISTMAS AND SO MANY OTHERS DO

1216
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
NOT.
AND I SPOKE WITH A WOMAN EARLIER

1217
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
TODAY, SHE HAS A DAUGHTER NAMED

1218
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
ALEXIS.
SHE WAS A THIRD GRADER HERE,

1219
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
SHE'S OKAY, TOO.

1220
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
SHE SAID THROUGHOUT THE DAY,

1221
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING, SHE'S BEEN

1222
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
ASKING HER QUESTIONS.

1223
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THEN FINALLY HER DAUGHTER, FROM

1224
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THE THIRD GRADE, AGE EIGHT,

1225
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
SAID, MOM, ARE YOU GOING TO BE

1226
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OKAY?

1227
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN ABOUT

1228
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
HOW THEY ABSORB THIS AND HOW

1229
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
THEY TRY AND INTERPRET IT AND

1230
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
UNDERSTAND IT.

1231
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
AND THEY, JUST LIKE IT WHOLE

1232
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
TOWN, ARE NOW LEFT TO LIVE WITH

1233
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THIS FOR THE REST OF THEIR

1234
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
LIVES, BILL.

1235
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
>> Bill: THE ONLY ADVICE I COULD

1236
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
GIVE TO ANYBODY THREW IS BE

1237
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
STRONG.

1238
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
PARENTS HAVE TO BE STRONG FOR

1239
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE TO

1240
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BE VERY WELL AWARE THAT THIS

1241
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
THING IS GOING TO GO ON FOR A

00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
