00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
THAT TEMPERATURE, IT'S GOING TO

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
BE THAT TEMPERATURE.

ELECTRIC COOKTOP.

32
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
>> I PUT THE WATER IN THE PAN

33
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND TURNED AROUND AND THE NEXT

34
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THING I KNEW, IT WAS BOILING.

>> THAT'S HARD TO DO.

102
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
>> IN FACT, THAT'S THE PROBLEM

103
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
WITH THE OLD STOVETOPS,

104
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WHETHER IT'S GAS OR ELECTRIC--

105
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
YOU CAN TURN IT UP AND DOWN,

106
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
BUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

107
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
PRECISE CONTROL, YOU'RE GOING

108
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
TO GET BOIL-OVERS.

109
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE PRECISE

110
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
CONTROL, YOU'RE GOING TO BURN

111
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THE CEREAL ON THE BOTTOM FROM

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
TIME TO TIME.

113
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

114
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
PRECISE TEMPERATURE CONTROL,

115
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BURN A STEAK

116
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OR A PORK CHOP ON YOUR STOVE.

117
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
YOU SEE, YOU'RE NOT THE BAD COOK

118
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
IN THE KITCHEN.

119
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000

COOKING TEMPERATURE.

144

WELL FOR LESS WITH THE NUWAVE

146
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
PRECISION INDUCTION COOKTOP.

147
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
IT'S THE MOST ENERGY-EFFICIENT

148
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
WAY TO COOK.

149
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE NUWAVE P.I.C. USES

150
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
INDUCTION TECHNOLOGY.

151
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE SECRET IS AN INTERNAL SERIES

152
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
OF COPPER COILS.

153
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THESE COILS GENERATE A MAGNETIC

154
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
FIELD WITHIN YOUR METAL POTS

155
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AND PANS.

156
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THE MAGNETIC FIELD CAUSES

157
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
INVISIBLE MOLECULES TO BEGIN

158
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
VIBRATING RAPIDLY, CREATING

159
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HEAT, SO THE COOKWARE ITSELF

160
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
HEATS THE FOOD.

161
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> ONE OF MY PASSIONS

162
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
ARE BUTTER SAUCES.

163
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF

164
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
COOKING A BUTTER SAUCE IS THAT

165
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IF YOU GET IT TOO HOT,

166
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
YOU KNOW, OVER 135 DEGREES,

167
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
IT BREAKS DOWN.

168
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IF YOU GET IT TOO COOL,

169
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IT CONGEALS.

170
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE BEAUTY OF THE NUWAVE P.I.C.

171
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
IS THAT I CAN CONTROL THE

172
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TEMPERATURE EXACTLY AND KEEP

173
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THE SAUCE FOR AN EXTENDED

174
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
PERIOD OF TIME.

175
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THAT'S SUCH AN ADDED BONUS

176
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
FOR A PROFESSIONAL COOK

177
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
AND A HOME COOK.

178
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> LET ME SHOW YOU THIS

179
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
UNUSUAL PAN.

180
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
BOB, WHAT DID WE DO HERE?

181
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> WELL, WE ACTUALLY CUT A PAN

182
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
AND CUT A SECTION OUT,

183
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
BECAUSE IN HERE YOU CAN SEE WE

184
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
HAVE CEREAL RAPIDLY BOILING,

185
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
RIGHT? >> BOILING AWAY.

186
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> I CAN PUT MY HAND

187
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
RIGHT THERE.

188
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> IT'S AMAZING.
MOVE YOUR HAND.

189
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'M GOING TO PUT AN ICE CUBE

190
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
RIGHT THERE.

191
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IT'S NOT MELTING.

192
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
>> BECAUSE ALL OF THE ENERGY IS

193
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
GOING INTO COOKING YOUR FOOD.

194
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THERE'S NOTHING WASTED ANYWHERE

195
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
OUTSIDE OF THE PAN, SO THIS IS

196
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PERFECTLY COOL.

197
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
SO WIPE THAT ICE CUBE OFF THERE.

198
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'M USING A PAPER TOWEL

203
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ON A BURNER.

204
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THERE'S NO FIRE, THERE'S NO

205
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FLAME, SO IT'S SO SAFE.

206
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> AND THE MINUTE YOU PUT THE

207
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
PAN BACK ON IT STARTS BOILING

THE P.I.C. AND THE PAN.

214
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
INSTANTLY IT STARTS

215
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BOILING AGAIN.

216
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

217
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

218

>> NO, IT JUST HEATS THE

247
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
MAGNETIC PART OF THE POT.

248
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THIS IS AT 110.

249
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
YOU CAN LEAVE IT AT 110 AND IT

250
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WON'T GET GLOPPY, IT WON'T GET

251
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000

HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN THE KITCHEN.

572
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SO I'LL TAKE IT INTO MY DINING

573

ROOM AND I'LL SET UP MY OWN EGG

574
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
STATION, SO WHEN I HAVE

575
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
VISITORS-- ESPECIALLY MY

576
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000

ALL I HAVE TO DO TO MAKE THE

585
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
OMELET IS TIP IT, THE OMELET

586
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
RUNS BACK.

587
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I TIP IT AGAIN, IT RUNS BACK.

588
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'M GOING TO BE ABLE

589
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000

592
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE SOME

593

601
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
COOK WHILE IT'S IN THE PAN.

602

>> THE HEATING IS CONSISTENT,

606
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
SO I CAN SET UP A BUFFET WITH

607
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE AND HAVE

608
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE

609
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
GOING TO MAINTAIN.

610
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST

611
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000

612
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
THE LAST PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH

613
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THE BUFFET, THEY GET THE COLD

614
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000

615
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
THE FOOD STAYS WARM THROUGH

OVER 200 PIECES OF CHICKEN,

886
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
AND THIS IS WHAT THE OIL

887
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
LOOKED LIKE. >> IT LOOKS LIKE

888
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000

893
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000

895
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
YOU SET IT SOMEPLACE BETWEEN

YOU DON'T KNOW.

897
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000

899
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS.

900
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
YOU HAVE TO THROW THE OIL AWAY.

901
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
>> YEAH.

TEMPERATURE HIGH SO THE GREASE

925
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
DOESN'T GET IN THE FOOD,

926
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
WHERE YOU'RE NOT ENDING UP WITH

927
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
GREASY CHICKEN OR GREASY FISH.

928
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000

DID YOU KNOW THAT EVERY 85

937
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
SECONDS, A FIRE STRIKES A HOME

938
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
IN AMERICA?

939
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
AND MOST OFTEN, THAT FIRE STARTS

940
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
IN THE KITCHEN.

941
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
>> MY VERY, VERY FIRST FIRE WAS

942
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
A 16-YEAR-OLD KID WHO WAS

943
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
COOKING FRENCH FRIES ON

944
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
THE STOVE AND HE FORGOT ABOUT

945
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THEM AND HE BURNED HIS PARENTS'

946
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
ENTIRE HOUSE DOWN.

947
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
>> Announcer: WELL, THAT WILL

NO RED-HOT ELECTRIC COIL TO

952

CATCH FIRE AND AS SOON AS A POT

FORGETFUL AND I'M ALWAYS A BIT

961
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
WORRIED THAT SHE MIGHT START

962
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
A FIRE AND THE P.I.C.'S GOING
