COMMENT ON PENDING LAWSUITS, BUT

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ONE OF THE SHOW'S PRODUCERS DID

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SAY THIS RECENTLY.

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
>> I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU THAT

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE STUFF FOUND IN THOSE

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
CONTAINERS ARE FOUND IN THE

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
STORAGE CONTAINERS.

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
>> Reporter: ALTHOUGH HE DID

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
ADMIT THEY SOMETIMES MOVE ITEMS

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
FROM ONE STORAGE LOCKER TO
ANOTHER.

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
LEVEL OF REALITY IN REALITY TV

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
HAS BEEN QUESTIONED.

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
RECENTLY, A FORMER PARTICIPANT

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ON HGTV'S REQUESTS HOUSE

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
HUNTERS," WHICH FOLLOWS FAMILIES

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
CHOOSING A NEW HOME, SAID

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
PRODUCERS KNEW SHE AND HER

105
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HUSBAND HAD ALREADY PURCHASED

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THEIR NEW HOME BEFORE THEY TAPED

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THE SHOW IN 2006.

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> FINALLY THE PRODUCER SAID

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
LET'S DO WHATEVER.

110
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SO WE CALLED OUR VERY CLOSEST

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AND KINDEST FRIENDS WHO WERE

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THAT GENEROUS AND THEY OFFERED

113
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
UP THEIR HOUSES FOR US TO TOUR

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AS OUR PRETEND DECISION MAKING

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
HOUSES.

116
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
>> Reporter: IN A STATEMENT,

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HGTV SAID WE AREN'T SHOWING A

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
DOCUMENTARY, WE'RE SIMPLY

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ENTERTAINING OUR VIEWERS.

120
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
>> REALITY TV IS A LITTLE BIT

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
LIKE SAUSAGE.
YOU MIGHT LOVE THE WAY IT TASTES

122
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT

123
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
TO KNOW HOW IT'S MADE.

124
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
>> Reporter: CLEARLY, MOST

125
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
VIEWERS KNOW THAT NOT EVERY

126
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
FIGHT OR DRUNKEN HOOK UP ON

127
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
REALITY TV IS REAL.

128
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
BUT WHEN THERE'S A COMPETITION,

129
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF SOME

130
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AUTHENTICITY.
BACK IN THE 1950s, AFTER

131
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
REVELATIONS THAT CONTESTANTS ON

132
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
POPULAR QUIZ SHOWS WERE SECRETLY

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
GIVEN THE ANSWERS, CONGRESS HELD

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HEARINGS AND MADE IT ILLEGAL TO

135
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
RIG QUIZ SHOWS.

136
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR STYLE.

137
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> Reporter: NOBODY ALLEGES THE

138
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
LEVEL OF MANIPULATION ON TODAY'S

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
REALITY SHOWS IS ANYWHERE NEAR

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THAT, AND LEGAL EXPERTS WE SPOKE

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
WITH DON'T THINK THE PRODUCERS

142
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OF "STORAGE WARS" ARE IN DANGER

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OF ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES.

144
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS

145
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
REALLY A CONTEST WITH A PRIZE.

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THEY GET TO BUY A LOCKER FULL OF

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
STUFF AND SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT

148
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
BE A JEWEL IN THERE, BUT THAT'S

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
NOT NECESSARILY A PRIZE FROM THE

150
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SPONSOR.
>> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

151
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PRODUCERS OF THIS PROGRAM TO

152
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

153
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AUDIENCE THAT MAKES THEM BELIEVE

154
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IS

155
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
REAL.

156
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AND IF THIS CAN BE ANNIHILATED,

157
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
NOT ONLY IN A LEGAL COURT BUT IN

158
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, IT

159
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
CAN UNDERMINE THE RATINGS

160
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
GREATLY.
>> Reporter: WHICH IS WHY AT

THE MOGUL'S ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
IMPORTANT.

all the political spin.

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because for our 37 million
members, only one word counts.

Get the facts at earnedasay.org.
Let's keep Medicare...

188
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and Social Security strong for
generations to come.

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WHY LET ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION
GET IN YOUR WAY?

190
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT VIAGRA.

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ASK IF YOUR HEART IS HEALTHY
ENOUGH FOR SEX.

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
IF YOU TAKE NITRATES
FOR CHEST PAIN;

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE HEADACHE,
FLUSHING,

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
UPSET STOMACH,
AND ABNORMAL VISION.

197
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

198
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
STOP TAKING VIAGRA
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
IF YOU EXPERIENCE
A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
IN VISION OR HEARING.

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THIS IS THE AGE
OF TAKING ACTION.

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
VIAGRA.
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THIS IS THE AGE
OF TAKING ACTION.
TO THE BEST VACATION
