188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PORTUGUESE SO OUR LAST

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGUESE.

190
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SHE SAID THEY LOVED ME AND I

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THE DOOR.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
>> KIDS THAT SURVIVED THE

197

OUT IN THE SANCTUARY.

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
PARENTS ARE TAKING A BREAK FROM

>> WHILE THE NATION HAS BEEN

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
FOCUSED ON THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
CONNECTICUT, POLICE AND SCHOOL

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000

LUCKILY FELLOW STUDENTS HELPED

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PREVENT A POTENTIAL TRAGEDY.

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> OUR PROCESS WORKED WELL SO WE

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
CAN BUILD ON THAT.

243
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE, WE'RE

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
AND HOPEFULLY WE NEVER HAVE TO

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
DEAL WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
AGAIN.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ANYTIME WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS,

250
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THAT'S THE MOST PRIORITY.

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> SCHOOL OFFICIALS THERE ADDED

252
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
EXTRA PATROLS TO KEEP PEOPLE

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
SAFE FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

254
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
>>> THE SHOOTINGS ARE SPARKING

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BEST WAY

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AT SCHOOL.

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
MANY SCHOOLS AROUND THE NATION

258
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
ARE CONDUCTING STANDARD SECURITY

259
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
DRILLS AFTER THE 1999 SHOOTING

260
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
IN COLUMBINE BUT NOW SOME

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OFFICIALS SAY IT MAY BE TIME TO

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
UPDATE THOSE PROCEDURES.

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
JOINING US NOW IS DR. SONY

264
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000

HAVEN INTERNATIONAL.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY OUR THOUGHTS

268
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE TOWN IN

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
CONNECTICUT AND WE'RE JUST

270
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
HORRIFIED BY THAT TRAGEDY.

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
>> IT'S JUST -- YOU CAN'T EVEN

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IMAGINE WHAT THOSE FAMILIES MUST

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BE GOING THROUGH.

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
AND MAYBE WE'RE GOING A STEP TOO

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
FAR HERE BEING A LITTLE BIT

276
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
SELFISH IN TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
KEEP OUR OWN KIDS SAFE BUT WE

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOPE TO LEARN SOMETHING FROM

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THIS.
YOU WERE VERY KIND IN SENDING ME

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A WHITE PAPER TO READ ABOUT

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THIS.
I FIND THIS INTERESTING, IT'S

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
CALLED FIGHT, FLIGHT, OR

283
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
LOCKDOWN.

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THAT STAFF

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
AND STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT HOW TO

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
ATTACK ACTIVE SHOOTERS.

287
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THE TEACHERS IN THIS CASE DID

288
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
TRY TO APPROACH.

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WHAT WENT RIGHT AND WHAT ELSE

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CAN BE DONE?

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THE

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WHITE PAPER THAT WE SENT, IT

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
OUTLINES THE PROS AND CONS.

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THERE'S SOME SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BY PRACTITIONERS THAT -- TO TRY

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
TO FIGHT AND ATTACK AN ATTACKER.

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WHILE IN SOME INSTANCES THAT CAN

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BE EFFECTIVE, ONE THING THAT WE

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
NEED TO CAUTION SCHOOLS IN DOING

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THAT IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A

302
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SITUATION MORE HARMFUL IN A

303
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SITUATION WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, AN

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AGGRESSOR MAY COME INTO A

305
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
CLASSROOM AND WANTING TO TAKE

306
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HOSTAGES AND YOU FIGHT THEM.

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THAT COULD TURN A HOSTAGE

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SITUATION INTO A SHOOTING

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
SITUATION.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN THIS

310
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
COUNTRY.
SO THAT MAY NOT BE THE BEST

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
ALTERNATIVE.
>> IT HAS TO BE ANALYZED

312
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
QUICKLY.

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
IT'S LIFE OR DEATH AND YOU NEED

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
TO MAKE A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION.

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
CAN YOU TEACH TEACHERS -- CAN

316
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
YOU TEACH STUDENTS?

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

318
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ONE OF THE APPROACHES THAT WE

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ADVOCATE OVER ANYTHING IS WHAT

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WE CALL AN ALL HAZARD APPROACH.

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THAT IS LOOKING AT SAFETY SAFETY

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
HOLISTICALLY.
WE HAVE TO TRAIN TEACHERS, YOU

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
HAVE TO TRAIN EDUCATORS TO DO

324
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
MENTAL SIMULATION DRILLS AND

325
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PRACTICE RESPONSE SO THEY FEEL

326
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
COMFORT THE CARRYING OUT THEIR

327
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
FUNCTION.
ALSO ENPOWER THEM TO MAKE THE

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
NECESSARY LIFE-SAVING DECISIONS

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
WITHOUT BEING TOLD TO DO SO.

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
>> THEY HAVE TO DO THAT AND THEY

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
HAVE TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN ALSO.

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
IS THAT TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
FOR A TEACHER?

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
SHOULD WE NOT LEAVE THIS TO THE

335
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
PROFESSIONALS?

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
HOW IT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A ARMED UNIFORMED OR

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
PLAIN-CLOTHED SECURITY

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
PROFESSIONAL AT THE DOOR OF

340
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
EVERY SCHOOLIE THE COUNTRY?

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THERE.

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
>> MOST SCHOOLS HAVE CAMPUS

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
POLICE WHO ARE ARMED.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
ONE THING WE ADVOCATE FOR

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
TEACHERS, YOU HAVE TO DO MONTHLY

346
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
FIRE DRILLS.

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
YOU HAVE TO DO MONTHLY DRILLS.

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
SO LET'S TAKE THOSE DRILLS AND

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
REVIEW THEM AND SEE WHAT WORKED

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WELL.
REMEMBER, A FIRE DRILL IS AN

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
EVACUATION DRILL.

352
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SO WE CAN TAKE WHAT WE'RE IT

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
DOING AND IMPROVE UPON THAT.

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
WE STRESS THAT WHEN DEVELOPING

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
CRISIS PLANS, SCHOOLS WORK WITH

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
YOUR LOCAL OFFICIALS, WITH YOUR

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WITH YOUR FIRE,

358
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SO YOU GET LOCAL INPUT TO THE

359
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
BEST ACTION TO TAKE.

360
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
>> WITH PARENTS, TOO, NOTIFYING

361
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEM, WHAT THEY CAN DO AS THEY

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HEAR IT, FOR MANY, ON THE NEWS.

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THANK YOU, D

VICTORY IN THE REFERENDUM THEY

373
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
HOPE WILL END WEEKS OF VIOLENT

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
PROTESTS BUT SOME SAY COULD

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
SOLIDIFY A ISLAMIST STATE.

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
GREG IS LIVE WITH THE LATEST.

377
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
>> YEAH, IT SEEMS THE FOLKS IN

378
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE IN

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THE LEAD.

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF TWO

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
ROUNDS OF VOTING AND THE RESULTS

382
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
ARE PRELIMINARY.

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THE YES VOTE GOT 57%, NO, 43%.

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
TURNOUT WAS LOW BY EGYPTIAN

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
STANDARD AND THE OPPOSITION

387
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
CLAIMS VARIES IRREGULARITIES.

388
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AS WE'VE SEEN, WASHINGTON WAS

389
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
MARRED BY VIOLENCE.

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
HEADQUARTERS OF A SECULAR PARTY

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
ATTACKED BY ISLAMIST DESPITE

392
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
20,000 TROOPS IN THE STREET

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE.

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
>> WHAT'S THE GOVERNMENT SAYING

395
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ABOUT THIS?

396
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
>> GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THAT

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
IS NOT TOO STRONG.

398
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THEY'RE PUSHING FORWARD, WHICH

399
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
IS BASICALLY WHAT CRITICS ARE

400
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SAYING, THEY'RE RAMMING IT

401
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THROUGH.

402
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
NOW THEY'RE READY FOR THE NEXT

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
VOTE.
THIS IS A CONSTITUTION THAT'S

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
DIVIDED THIS NEW DEMOCRACY,

405
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
FAVORED BY MOHAMMED MORSI AND

406
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE MUSLIMS DEFENDERS SAY IT'S

407
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
NEEDED TO GAIN THE PROTECTION.

408
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
NEXT SATURDAY'S VOTING WILL

409
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
HAPPEN IN THE RURAL AREAS OF THE

410
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
COUNTRY, FAVORABLE TO THE

411
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIST PARTY.

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
SO AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS THIS

413
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
CONSTITUTION'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

414
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
THERE ARE A CHANCES FOR THE

415
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
OPPOSITION TO MODIFY IT AFTER

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
THE FACT BUT THAT'S DIFFICULT.

417
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THE NEW CONSTITUTION ALSO MEANS

418
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THERE WILL BE A NEW PARLIAMENT

419
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
VOTED IN BUT ISLAMISTS ON THAT

420
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
SIDE ARE WELL ORGANIZED.

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THE FEAR IS THAT THE OPPONENTS,

422
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THE CRITICS, WILL AGAIN HAVE TO

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
TAKE IT TO THE STREETS.

424
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> ALL RIGHT, SO POTENTIALLY THE

425
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
VIOLENCE AND DEMONSTRATIONS MAY

426
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
NOT END.

427
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
>>> AS YOU HEARD GREG REPORT,

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THE ISLAMIST PREDICTED TO SCORE

429
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A VICTORY IN THE WEEKEND VOTE.

430
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR EGYPT'S

431
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
FUTURE, THE ROLE OF MORSI AND

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE POTENTIAL OF A ISLAMIST

433
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
STATE IN EGYPT.

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
JOHN BOLTON JONES US ABOUT EVERY

435
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SUNDAY AT THIS TIME.

436
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
GOOD MORNING, EMBASSADOR.

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> GOOD MORNING.

438
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
>> THE NEW CONSTITUTION SAYS

439
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
ISLAM IS THE OFFICIAL RELIGION

440
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
OF THE STATE.

441
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
WHAT OTHER IMPACT IS THERE OF

442
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THIS CONSTITUTION AND WHAT DOES

443
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
IT CALL FOR?

444
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> I THINK IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL

445
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
STEP TOWARD WHAT THE MUSLIM

446
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
BROTHERHOOD DESIRED, AND THAT IS

447
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A EGYPT THAT COMES UNDER SHAHRY

448
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
ARE A LAW AND A NONDEMOCRATIC

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
STATE.
THERE WAS SPECULATION THE MORE

450
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
EXTREME EGYPTIANS WERE GOING TO

451
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
VOTE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION

452
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT

453
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
WAS SHARIA FRIENDLY ENOUGH.

454
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
THAT CLEARLY DIDN'T HAPPEN AND

455
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
IN THE SECOND ROUND, THERE'S NO

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
DOUBT THIS CONSTITUTION WILL BE

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
ADOPTED BY A MAJORITY OF THOSE

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
WHO VOTED.

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
SO I THINK THE PROSPECT IS THE

460
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
BROTHERHOOD WILL TRY TO

461
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
CONSOLIDATE POWER.

462
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I THINK THERE'S EVERY PROSPECT

463
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
THE MILITARY AND BROTHERHOOD

464
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
WILL TRY TO CUT A DEAL.

465
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I DON'T THINK THE MILITARY WANTS

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
TO SEE MORE VIOLENCE IN THE

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
STREETS.
THEY'VE HAD A VOTE, THIS IS WHAT

468
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE PRO DEMOCRACY PEOPLE WANTED.

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
HAD AN ELECTION, A REFERENDUM

470
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
AND VOTE AND THEY LOST.

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I THINK THE BROTHERHOOD IS IN

472
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
VERY GOOD SHAPE IN TERMS OF

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
CONSOLIDATING POWER.

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US IF

475
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
INDEED EGYPT MOVES TO SHARIA LAW

476
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
AND POTENTIALLY RULED AND

477
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
GOVERNED BY THE MUSLIM

478
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
BROTHERHOOD?

479
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> THE DOMESTIC ISSUES IN EGYPT

480
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
ARE GRAVE FOR THE COP TICK

481
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
CHRISTIANS, FOR SECULAR

482
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
EGYPTIANS TO DON'T WANT A

483
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
RELIGIOUS STATE.

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
BUT I THINK THERE ARE ALSO

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR PEACE

486
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
AND STABILITY IN THE REGION FOR

487
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THE FUTURE OF THE CAMP DAVID

488
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
PEACE ACCORD FOR ISRAEL.

489
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
FOR WHAT AID THEY GIVE TO

490
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
RADICAL ISLAMIST ELSEWHERE IN

491
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THE REGION ACT THE NOT JUST

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
AGAINST ISRAEL BUT ARAB REGIMES

493
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
FRIENDLY TO THE UNITED STATES.

494
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THERE ARE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES

495
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY IF

496
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
EGYPT KEEPS GOING.

497
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> DO YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING

498
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IN EGYPT AND IN SYRIA, FOR

499
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
EXAMPLE.
NEW RISE OF ISLAMIST THAT ARE

500
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
AGAINST OUR INTEREST.

501
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

502
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
SYRIA IS A CASE WHERE IT MAY BE

503
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A BLOW TO IRAN BUT GIVEN WHAT

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
WE'VE SEEN ABOUT RADICAL SUNY

505
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
ISLAMIST, WE'RE REPLACING ONE

506
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
BAD REGIME WITH ANOTHER.

507
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THE IMPLICATIONS WILL SPREAD.

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
WE'VE SEEN IN LIBYA THE

509
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
INABILITY OF THE SUCCESSOR

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
GOVERNMENT TO GADHAFI TO CONTROL

511
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THE ENTIRE TERRITORY.

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
SAME IN YEMEN.

513
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THE RISK COULD CAUSE THE ENTIRE

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
MIDDLE EAST TO DESCEND INTO A

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
SITUATION OF NEAR ANARCHY WHERE

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ALL THE VARIES CRISIS COME

517
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
TOGETHER.
>> YOU TALK ABOUT NEAR ANARCHY.

518
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SIR WHERE SYRIA, LIBYA, WHAT CAE

519
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DO AND WHAT

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ARE THEY NOT DOING THAT THEY

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SHOULD DO TOE STABILIZE IT.

522
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE PAYING

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
ADEQUATE ATTENTION.

524
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
IT'S MANIFESTATION OF THE FACT

525
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT

526
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
NATIONAL SECURITY.

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
HIS PRIORITIES ARE DOMESTIC.

528
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
HE TURNS TO IT WHEN HE HAS TO

529
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
LIKE THE SEPTEMBER 11 KILLINGS

530
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
IN BENGHAZI BUT WE STILL DON'T

531
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
HAVE ANSWERS AS TO WHY ENHANCED

532
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SECURITY WASN'T PROVIDED BEFORE

533
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THE ATTACK AND HOW TO EXPLAIN

534
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THIS STORY OF THE MOVIE ABOUT

535
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD AS THE

536
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
CAUSE OF THE ATTACK.

537
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I THINK IN EGYPT SPECIFICALLY WE

538
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NEED TO TRY AND USE OUR

539
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
INFLUENCE ON THE EGYPTIAN

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
MILITARY TO STABILIZE THE

541
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
SITUATION.
AND TO USE ALL THOSE BILLIONS OF

542
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
DOLLARS OF AIDE WE'VE GIVEN OVER

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
THE YEARS TO TRY TO PREVENT THE

544
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION FROM

545
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
DETERIORATING FURTHER.

546
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
>> THERE'S LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE

547
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
THE PRESIDENT'S PAYING

548
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
ATTENTION.

549
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

550
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT NATIONAL

551
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
SECURITY?
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

552
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> HIS RECORD OVER THE PAST FOUR

553
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
YEARS, AS HE SAID DURING

554
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THE 2008 CAMPAIGN, HE WANTED TO

555
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM AMERICA

556
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND THAT'S WHAT HE SET ABOUT

557
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
DOING.
I DON'T THINK HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE

558
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
WITH DECLINE IN AMERICAN

559
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
INFLUENCE INTERNATIONALLY.

560
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THAT'S WHAT IS PLAYING OUT IN

561
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW.

562
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> THE VOTE CONTINUES NEXT

563
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
SATURDAY LIKELY TO GO EVEN MORE

564
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
CONSERVATIVE.

565
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
EMBASSADOR BOLTON, ALWAYS GOOD

566
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
TO SEE YOU.

567
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
>> THANK YOU.

568
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
>>> FOR THESE TWO HOURS WE'LL

569
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE LATEST IN

570
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
THE NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

571
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
SHOOTING MASSACRE AND THE

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
MASSIVE INVESTIGATION STILL

573
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
UNDER WAY.

574
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
IT INVOLVES LOCAL, STATE, AND

575
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
FEDERAL AGENTS FANNING OUT

576
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
ACROSS THE STATE CHASING LEADS

577
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THEY HOPE WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE

578
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
TRAGEDY.

579
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

580
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
VICTIMS LIKE 6-YEAR-OLD EMILIE

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
PARKER, WHOSE GRIEVING FATHER

582
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
TALKED TO REPORTERS AFTER POLICE

583
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
RELEASED THE NAMES OF THE

584
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
VICTIM.
SOMEHOW HE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO

585
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
FORGIVE.
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

586
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Mmmm tasty.

587
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And cut! Very good.

588
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

589
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

590
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

591
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's not real.

592
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

593
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

594
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

595
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Is bigger than we think ...
Sometimelike the flu.fer from

596
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

597
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's something
that works differently

599
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

601
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
in adults and children
one year and older

604
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
whose flu symptoms started
within the last two days.

605
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Before taking TAMIFLU tell your
doctor if you're pregnant,

606
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
nursing. have serious
health conditions,

607
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
or take other medicines.

608
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

609
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

610
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

611
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Children and adolescents in
particular may be at an

612
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
increased risk
of seizures, confusion

613
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
or abnormal behavior.

614
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The most common
side effects are

615
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

616
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The flu comes on fast,

617
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
so ask your
doctor about TAMIFLU.

618
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Prescription for flu.

619
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
HOME STAYED CONNECTICUT, SENATOR

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
JOE LIEBERMAN TALKING ABOUT

621
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN.

HE SAT DOWN WITH CHRIS WALLACE

623
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000

HIS VISION FOR THE WAY HE WANTS

625
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THE GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
>> THIS REMINDS ME OF THE DAYS

628
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AND WEEKS AFTER THE TERRORIST

629
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
ATTACKS AGAINST US OF 9/11 AND

630
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
AT ONE POINT, JOHN McCAIN AND

631
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I SAID WE CAN'T LET THIS GO.

632
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WE'VE GOT TO CREATE A NATIONAL

633
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE

634
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS WE'RE

635
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
ASKING ABOUT NEWTOWN.

636
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN AND IS

637
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
THERE ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO

638
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

639
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
AGAIN?

640
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
>> JOINING ME, THE ANCHOR OF

641
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
"FOX NEWS SUNDAY," CHRIS

642

WALLACE.

643
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

644
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
>> GOOD MORNING.

645
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP, THE

646
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
SENATOR THINKS WE SHOULDN'T

647
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
OVERLOOK IT.

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
WE TALKING ABOUT IT,

649
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED AND

650
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GO

651
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
FROM HERE, BUT WEEKS FROM NOW

652
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
WHEN THERE'S OTHER NEWS, IS HE

653
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
OPTIMISTIC OUR GOVERNMENT WILL

654
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE OUR

655
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
KIDS SAFER?

656
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
>> I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN BE

657
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OPTIMISTIC.

658
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WE'VE HAD SO MANY SHOOTINGS AND

659
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
OUTPORTION OF GRIEF AND NOTHING

660
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HAPPENS.

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
CAN WE TAKE THIS AND TURN IT

662
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
INTO SOMETHING USEFUL?

663
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
LIEBERMAN CALLED FOR A NATIONAL

664
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
COMMISSION AND SOME PEOPLE ARE

665
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
SAYING THAT'S WHAT WE NEED,

666
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ANOTHER COMMISSION.

667
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IT'S A COMPLICATION ISSUE.

668
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
MENTAL HEALTH, THESE KIDS IN

669
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
EACH OF THESE CASES, MOST YOUNG

670
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
MEN, ALL WITH HISTORIES OF

671
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

672
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PERSONALITY

673
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
DISORDERS, AND IT DOESN'T MEAN

674
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THEY'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT PEOPLE,

675
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
BUT HOW DO WE DETECT THE TIPPING

676
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
POINT WHEN THEY GO OVER THAT

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
LINE?
ALSO OUR CULTURE.

678
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
ALL OF US WHO HAVE KIDS SEE THEM

679
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
WITH THESE DARN VIDEO GAMES AND

680
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
MOVIES AND THINGS WHERE THEY'VE

681
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
SEEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

682
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
ACTS OF VIOLENCE ALL FICTIONAL

683
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
BUT OVER AND OVER BY THE TIME

684
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THEY'RE TEN YEARS OLD.

685
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THEN THERE'S THE GUNS.

686
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IT'S NOT A SIMPLE ANSWER BUT --

687
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
GOSH, WE CAN'T LET THIS TO

688
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND HAPPEN

689
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
AND HAPPEN.

690
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
>> FORGIVE ME, FOR THE FIRST

691
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
TIME I DISAGREE.

692
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE VIDEO

693
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SITUATION BUT IF IT TURNS OUT

694
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THIS MOTHER ACQUIRED THESE GUNS

695
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
AND TOOK HER SONS TO THE RANGE

696
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
TO LEARN HOW TO SHOOT, THAT SHE

697
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
WAS OBSESSED WITH SELF-DEFENSE,

698
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I THINK IT STOPS WITH THE

699
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
PARENTS.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IT

700
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
COULD TURN OUT TO BE IT'S NOT

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
SYMPTOMATIC OF A MENTAL

702
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
DISORDER, LIKE YOU SAID, PLENTY

703
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
OF PEOPLE HAVE ASPERGER'S AND

704
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THEY'RE HIGH FUNCTIONING.

705
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
MANY IT'S PARENTAL EDUCATION.

706
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
HE THINKS IT'S STRICTLY THE

707
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY?

708
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
>> OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S PART OF SOCIETY, IT'S PART

709
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
OF OUR RELIGIOUS TRAINING AND

710
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
PARENTS.

711
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
BUT YOU KNOW, JAMIE, A LOT OF

712
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
PARENTS TAKE THEIR KIDS TO GUN

713
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
RANGES AND SHOOT GUNS PERFECTLY

714
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
AND THEY DON'T INDIANA UP GET --

715
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
END UP GETTING UP, KILLING THEIR

716
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
MOTHER AND SLAUGHTERING 27

717
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PEOPLE IN A SCHOOL.

718
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THAT'S SOMETHING DEEPLY

719
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
DISTURBED ABOUT THIS KID OR THE

720
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
RELATIONSHIP IN THE FAMILY.

721
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE'LL

722
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
NEVER BE ABLE TO DO.

723
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GO INTO

724
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
EVERY HOUSEHOLD AND POLICE IT.

725
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WHETHER IT'S MENTAL HEALTH OR

726
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
THE DESENSITIZATION OF PEOPLE TO

727
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY YOUNG

728
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
MEN.
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TO BEAR

729
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
ARMS -- AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

730
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
DISAGREE BUT WE SHOULD TALK

731
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
ABOUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN HAVE

732
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES AND

733
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
HANDGUNS THAT CAN KILL SO MANY

734
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
PEOPLE QUICKLY.

735
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
>> I GUESS MY POINT IS YES, YOU

736
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ALL THOSE

737
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THINGS UNLESS THEY FALL INTO THE

738
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
