1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
ARE MISSING THAT WILL MAKE IT

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
MORE DIFFICULT --

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
>> YES, THERE ARE PIECES MISSING

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
FINISH YET.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
THE FORENSIC PART IS AN

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
IMPORTANT PART.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THAT'S BEING WORKED ON BUT IT'S

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
NOT DONE YET.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THE WITNESSES NEED TO BE

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000

THERE IS AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
WITNESSES THAT NEED TO BE

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
INTERVIEWED.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
THAT'S NOT COMPLETED.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THERE ARE WEEKS OF WORK WE HAVE

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE

CONFERENCE THAT JUST WRAPPED,

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THE MOST COMPELLING PART,

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
PERHAPS, WAS WHEN THE LIEUTENANT

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
BASICALLY WARNED PEOPLE WHO HAVE

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
BEEN SOMEHOW -- WE DON'T KNOW

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SPECIFICALLY -- BUT USING SOCIAL

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
MEDIA TO POSE AS THE SHOOTER AND

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
TO OFFER SOME KIND OF

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
MISINFORMATION.

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
AND THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WARNED WHOEVER HAS BEEN USING

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THE SOCIAL MEDIA TO PERPETRATE

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
FEDERAL CRIMES.

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE WAS

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
REFERRING TO, BUT WE DO PLAN TO

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
LOOK INTO IT.

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THIS JUST HAPPENED.

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AND HE SAID THAT THE CRIME SCENE

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
PROCESSED AND THE CARS THAT WERE

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
PART OF THIS, THE VEHICLES HAVE

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ALL STARTED TO BE RETURNED TO

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THEIR OWNERS AND THE INSIDE OF

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE CRIME SCENE IS BEING WORKED

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
ON BY AUTHORITIES AND THE

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE ALSO

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT BE

125
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
RELEASING A TIMELINE ABOUT THE

126
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING ADAM

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
LANZA'S RAMPAGE.

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
BUT SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
WE HEARD THIS MORNING FROM THE

130
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MALLOY WAS

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THAT BASED ON HIS UNDERSTANDING

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OF THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
CRIME SCENE INSIDE ONE OF THE

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CLASSROOM, THE GUNMAN DECIDED TO

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
TAKE HIS OWN LIFE AS SOON AS HE

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
HEARD THAT AUTHORITIES, WHO WERE

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
ALSO ARMED, WERE GETTING CLOSE.

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
>> WE SURMISE THAT IT WAS DURING

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE SECOND CLASSROOM EPISODE AND

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HE HEARD THE RESPONDERS COMING

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
AND HE DECIDED TO TAKE HIS OWN

143
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
LIFE.
>> Reporter: AGAIN, RIGHT NOW,

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THERE IS NO INFORMATION,

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OFFICIALLY, OR UNOFFICIALLY

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ABOUT WHAT A MOTIVE MIGHT HAVE

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BEEN.
THE STATE POLICE WERE ASKED IF

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
EVER KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS.

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
HE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO ANSWER

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
EVERY POSSIBLE QUESTION IN THIS

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
CASE, AS BEST AS IS HUMANLY

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
POSSIBLE.

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
BUT MORE INFORMATION IS COMING
FROM ONE OF THE PARENTS, A

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD FIRST GRADER WHO

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SAW HIS TEACHER, THE 27-YEAR-OLD

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
VICTORIA SOTO, GOT SHOT AND HE

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
RAN AWAY AND HE IS TELLING MORE

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, EVERY

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SINGLE DAY.

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
IT'S VERY COMPELLING.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

163
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
>> THE CHILDREN ACTED ON

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
INSTINCT AND WHAT THEY WERE

165
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
TAUGHT, WHICH WAS TO RUN.

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND THEY D. THEY JUST RAN UP TO

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THE MAIN ROAD, 100 YARDS AWAY.

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MY SON AND SEVERAL OF HIS OTHER

169
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
STUDENTS WERE EXTREMELY BRAVE IN

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHAT THEY DID AND ACTED WITH

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
COURAGE THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT I

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HAVE.

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> Reporter: OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT
NOW, THE SHATTERED COMMUNITY IS

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES BACK

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TOGETHER, SO MANY PEOPLE WERE

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
LOST AND THE AUTHORITIES WERE

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ASKED TODAY, IF THEY THINK THOSE

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
STUDENTS WHO WERE INSIDE THE

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SCHOOL ARE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TO GO BACK TO SANDY HOOK

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
ELEMENTARY AND THE LOCAL POLICE

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
SAY THEY THINK IT WILL BE VERY

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
DIFFICULT.

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT
TO KEEP THE STUDENTS TOGETHER.

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
SO THEY ARE WORKING ON SOME KIND

186
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OF A CONTINGENCY PLAN THAT CAN

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
KEEP THE STUDENTS TOGETHER AND

188
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PERHAPS ALLOW THEM NOT TO EVER

189
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
GO BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY

190
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
EXPERIENCED SUCH A NIGHTMARE ON

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
FRIDAY.

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> THANK YOU.

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ROBBIE PARKER, THE DAD OF

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD EMILIE, ONE OF THE

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
FIRST PARENTS TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE SHOOTING.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HE DESCRIBES HIS DAUGHTER AS A

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HAPPY LITTLE GIRL WHO LIKED TO

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
MAKE CARDS AND ALMOST ALWAYS

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
CARRIED COLORED PINSILS AND

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
MARKERS.
SHE LOVED HER LITTLE SISTERS AND

202
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
CHEERING UP HER SAD FRIENDS.

203
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SHE DESCRIBED HIS LAST MOMENTS S

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WITH HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER FRIDAY

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
MORNING.

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE:  WOULD

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

208
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SUPPORT TO ALL OF THOSE VICTIMS

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
>> ALSO EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER.

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HE SENT LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
HIS FAMILY TO THEIRS.

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THE NATION UNITED AFTER PEOPLE

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
IN HIS DISTRICT WERE HIT HARD BY

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SUPER STORM SANDY AND NOW THE

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
NEIGHBORS ARE STRUGGLING WITH AN

225
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
UNTHINKABLE TRAGEDY.

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CONGRESSMAN KING IS HERE NOW.

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> THANK YOU, SHANNON.

229
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> YOUR THOUGHTS.

230
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
YOU HAVE HAD TO ASSIST A LOT OF

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
PEOPLE SUFFERING IN A DIFFERENT

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WAY.
NOW SOMETHING NEW.

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
>> YEAH.

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THIS IS SO INDESCRIBABLE.

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
ANY NATURAL DISASTER IS TERRIBLE

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ENOUGH.
BUT TO HAVE THE RANDOM, VICIOUS

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SHOOTING OF YOUNG CHILDREN LIKE

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THIS, IT'S REALLY BEYOND BELIEF.

239
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
INCIDENT LIKE THIS, TOUCHING THE

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
AMERICAN PSYCHE THE WAY THAT

242
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THIS HAS.

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
IT'S CAUSED SUCH SORROW.

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
OUR HEARTS AND RARES GO OUT TO

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THE FAMILIES OF THESE PEOPLE AND

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TO THE YOUNG KID WHO IS

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SURVIVED.
IM TRYING TO THINK, BACK IN

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
GRADE SCHOOL, THINGS ARE TOUGH

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ENOUGH, TRYING TO GO ON AFTER

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THE CHILD NEXT TO YOU OR YOUR

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BEST FRIEND -- TO ME, IT'S

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
INDESCRIBABLE, AS A COUNTRY, WE

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
HAVE TO FIND A WITO CONFRONT

254
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF DUMBING DOWN IS

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THE RIGHT EXPRESSION, BUT IT

256
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SEEMS LIKE EVERY MASS MURDER IS

257
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WORSE THAN THE ONE BEFORE.

258
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WHEN WE THINK WE HAVE HIT THE

259
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WORSE, LIKE COLORADO AND THE

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
MALL AND NOW THIS.
IT SEEMS AS IF THE COUNTRY, IN

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
SOME RESPECTS IS IN A REAL

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DOWNWARD DECLINE.
>> WE DID SEE AND WE CONTINUE TO

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
SEE IN THE WAKE OF SUPER STORM

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SANDY, A LOT OF GOOD SAMARITANS

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND PEOPLE REACHING OUT, EVEN

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WHEN THEY ARE SUFFERING TO HELP

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OTHERS.
DO YOU THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SEE THAT HERE, AS SOON AS THE

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
VERY, VERY FRESH WOUNDS BEGIN TO

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
HEAL?
>> I THINK SO.

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I THINK WE ARE SEEING IT

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
ALREADY.

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
NEIGHBORS, FRIEND, LAW

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ENFORCEMENT, CLERKY, EVERYONE

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
COMING TOGETHER, MENTAL HEALTH

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
PROFESSIONALS, EVERYONE OFFERS
TO HELP.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WE SAW IT AFTER 9/11 AND AFTER

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
KATRINA, AFTER SANDY.

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
OBVIOUSLY, TO ME, WE ARE SEEING

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
IT ALREADY IN CONNECTICUT.

281
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THAT REALLY IS THE HEART AND

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SOUL OF AMERICA.

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SO I DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY

284
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
DOWN WHEN I SAY THAT THE COUNTRY

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IS IN DECLINE.

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN DECLINE,

287
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
BUT THE REAL HEART AND SOUL OF

288
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN EVER.

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> OF COURSE, LIFE AND WORK

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
CONTINUES FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS

291
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WEEK YOUR WORK ON THE HILL WITH

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE TWO BENGHAZI HEARINGS, ONE

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
IN THE HOUSE AND ONE IN THE

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SENATE THIS WEEK.

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
BUT NEWS THAT SECRETARY CLINTON

296
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
IS ILL AND HAS BEEN INJURED WITH

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A CONCUSSION AND WILL NOT

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
TESTIFY.

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT OTHERS

300
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WHO WILL SHOW UP IN HER PLACE

301
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WILL PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED

302
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
ANSWERS.
>> I AM SURE THEY CAN PROVIDE

303
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ANSWERS, BUT ULTIMATELY, I

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BELIEVE THAT SECRETARY

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
CLINTONVILLE TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SECRETARY CLINTON.

307
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
NO ONE WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THIS THAN SHE WOULD.

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
NO ONE WOULD BE IN A POSITION,

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
REALLY TO ANSWER THE TOUGH

311
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
QUESTIONS OF SECRETARY CLINTON.

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ONCE SHE HAS RECOVERED, I

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SHE

314
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
TESTIFY.

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I KNOW THAT THE CHAIRWOMAN OF

316
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

317
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT

318
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SECRETARY CLINTON IS AN

319
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
INDOZENSIBLE WITNESS.

320
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI, THERE

321
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED

322
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
QUESTIONS, IT APPEARS SO MANY

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THINGS WENT WRONG AND TOO MANY

324
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WERE TRYING TO PUT OUT A FALSE

326
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
STORY, WHICH ACCOUNTS, I

327
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
BELIEVE, FOR THE CONSTANT

328
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
CHANGING OF THE STORY, AS WE

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
HAVE GONE ON AND THE STILL

330
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
UNANSWERED QUESTION.

331
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
BUT ULTIMATELY, I BELIEVE THAT

332
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SECRETARY CLINTON WILL TESTIFY

333
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
BECAUSE SHE REALLY IS IN

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
INDISPENSABLE.

335
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
>> AND THE FISCAL CLIFF

336
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
CONTINUES.
REPORTS THAT HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

337
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
BOEHNER WOULD BE OPEN TO RAISING

338
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
TAX RATE ON THOSE WHO MAKE A

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN

340
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
EXAMPLE FOR MAJOR CUTS

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ELSEWHERE.

342
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
IS THAT AN IDEA YOU CAN SUPPORT?

343
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OR IS IT A NO-GO FOR YOU IF

344
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THERE ARE ANY TAX INCREASES?

345
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> I HAVE GIVEN MY SUPPORT TO

346
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
JOHN BOEHNER.

347
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
WE'LL NEVER GET THE PERFECT

348
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
DEAL.
I AM CONFIDENT THAT JOHN WILL

349
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
GET THE BEST DEAL WE CAN, THE

350
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
PRESIDENT WON THE ELECTION, THE

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
DEMOCRATS TOOK THE SENATE, WE

352
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TOOK THE HOUSE.

353
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THERE IS BARG ANG GOINGOMP I

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THINK IT'S WRONG FOR REPUBLICANS

355
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
TO BE SECOND-GUESSING WHAT JOHN

356
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
BOEHNER MIGHT BE DOING OR LAYING

357
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OUT POSITIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CAN OR CANNOT SUPPORT.

359
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
VITOLD JOHN THAT BASED ON MY

360
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
KNOWLEDGE OF HIM AND HIS

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
COMMITMENT, I AM PREPARED TO

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SUPPORT THE AGREEMENT THAT HE

ULTIMATELY NEGOTIATES, CONVINCED

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THAT IT'S THE BEST WE GET UNDER

365
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

366
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
>> CONGRESSMAN PETER KING, WE

367
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000

>> THANK YOU.

369
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
>> IN JUST A FEW HOUR, PRESIDENT

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
OBAMA WILL TRAVEL TO NEW TONG TO

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
ACTIONS THAT MANY AT THE SCHOOL

681
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000

682
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW HER AT ALL.

683
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW -- IT COULD

684
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
HAVE BEEN MY KID.

685
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
> SHANNON: THOSE WHO KNEW

686
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
VICTORIA SAY HER LIFE-SAVING

687
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ACTIONS WERE NOT SURPRISING.

688
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THAT SHE PUT HER CHILDREN 50 AND

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WANT TO DO HER BEST FOR HEM.

690
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THIS BRINGS BACK PAINFUL

691
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
MEMORIES OF A STUDENT ON A

692
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
RAMPAGE IN VIRGINIA TECH,

693
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
>> SAD TO JOIN YOU UNDER THESE

703
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT IT'S AN

704
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND THE

705
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS TO HAVE THIS

706
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
CONVERSATION.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

707
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
> SHANNON: THERE ARE SO MANY

708
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
PORTIONS OF THE CONVERSATION TO

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
HAVE.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT TAIN A

710
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS ISSUE THERE

711
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
ARE SO MANY COMMON FACTORS WITH

712
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE

713
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
CRIMES, MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD

714
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
PLACE TO START.

715
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
>>IC IT IS.

716
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
IF YOU LOOK AT HORRIFIC

717
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
INCIDENTS AND YOU PULL BACK AND

718
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROFILE OF

719
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THE ACTORS.

720
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
FIRST OF ALL, NONE OF THESE WERE

721
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
SPONTANEOUS EVENTS.

722
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THEY WERE PLANNED.

723
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
MANY WERE PLANNED AND THE

724
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANNING WAS

725
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
KNOWN BY FELLOW STUDENT OR THEY

726
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
TALKED ABOUT THEIR SUICIDAL

727
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
TENDENCIES OR THEIR DESIRE TO

728
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
KILL PEOPLE TO FELLOW STUDENTS.

729
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
SO IT'S PREDICTABLE THATY WOOER

730
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

731
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
ADDITIONAL GUN CONTROL

732
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
LEGISLATION.

733
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
IT IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN

734
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
THAT -- NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T --

735
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
BUT THE FACT REMAINS, THERE ARE

736
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
MULTIPLE LAYERS, IF WE HAVE A

737
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT

738
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
REDUCING THE RISK OF THIS

739
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HAPPENING, WE BETTER START

740
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
DEALING WITH ALL THE LAYERS,

741
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IT'S ABOUT PRIEFACY AND MENTAL

742
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
HEALTH COUNSELING AND ABERRANT

743
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
BEHAVIOR AND GETTING THE PEOPLE

744
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THE HELP THEY NEED.
IT'S ABOUT STUDENTING TELLING

745
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
PARENT THEIR PARENTS OR

746
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
COUNSELORS THAT THEY HAVE HEARD

747
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE RUMBLINGS.

748
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DISAGREE

749
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
WITH ME, BUT I THINK THAT

750
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
VIOLENCE BEGETS VIOLENCE AND

751
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
HAVE YOU AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS

752
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
PERHAPS BEEN REJECTED, VILIFIED,

753
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
BULLIED, FEELS NOT PART OF THE

754
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
CROWD, THEY CAN LOSE THEMSELVES

755
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
IN A FANTASY WORLD OR A DIGITAL

756
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WORLD.

757
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
SUDDENLY, THEIR SENSE OF REALITY

758
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
IS LIKE NOTHING YOU AND I COULD

759
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
EVER APPRECIATE.
> SHANNON: DO YOU THINK THAT

760
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THERE IS A WAY TO BROACH THESE

761
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
TOPICS?
BECAUSE I WOULD IMAGINE EVERY

762
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
ONE OF USV HAS HAD SOMEONE IN

763
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
OUR LIVES, A FRIEND OR CO-WORKER

764
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
OR A NEIGHBOR THAT YOU KNOW

765
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
WE ARE HESITANT TO GET INVOLVED

767
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
TO INTRUDE ON SOMEONE'S PRIVACY,

768
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
BUT IT COULD MAKE ALL THE

769
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
DIFFERENCE.
WE KNOW ABOUT AN ALLEGED PLOT

770
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
BUSTED UP LAST WEEK WHEN THE

771
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OFFICERS GOT THE WORD FROM

772
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
FEELINGO STUDENT WHO IS SAID

773
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG WITH

774
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
THIS STUDENT.

775
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
HE IS SAYING THINGS THAT ARE

776
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
POTENTIALLY DEADLY.
>> IT IS TAKING A LONG TIME FOR

777
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
US CULTURALLY TO ACT WHEN WE SEE

778
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
FRIENDS STRUGGLING WITH

779
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
ALCOHOLISM.
WE DO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET

780
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
INTERVENTION.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE SAME

781
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
MIND-SET WITH THIS DISTORTED,

782
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR,

783
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
MANIFESTING ITSELF AND GET

784
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
INVOLVED.
A LEFT CONVERSATIONS DURING THE

785
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
HOLIDAY SEASON, COCKTAIL PARTIES

786
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND THE LIKE, WHEN ONE PIRNT

787
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SAYS, HOW'S YOUR SON DOING -- I

788
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
DOUBT ANY OF THE PARENTS SAYS,

789
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HE HAD A FEW MENTAL HEALTH

790
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
PROBLEMS WEERK HAVE HIM GOING TO

791
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
A THERAPIST.

792
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
WE ONLY RESPOND TO THE MENTAL

793
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
HEALTH CHALLENGES AFTER THE

794
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
FACTS AND FRANKLY, FAMILIES

795
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
IGNORE IT.

796
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
OR WE PUT THEM ON SEVERE

797
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
MEDICATION.

798
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
ONE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE

799
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
COLUMBINE SHOOTING WAS ON SEVERE

800
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
MEDICATION THAT COULD BE

801
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
CONTRIBUTED TO HIS AGGRESSIVE,

802
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.

803
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE A 360-LOOK AT

804
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THIS AND SENATOR LIEBERMAN IN A

805
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY SAID WE

806
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
BETTER HAVE A COMMISSION BECAUSE

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
IT'S FAR MORE THAN A PRESS

808
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
CONFERENCE.

809
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
IT IS FAR MORE THAN A SINGLE

810
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IF WE ARE

811
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
GOING ON REDUCE THE RISK OF THIS

812
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
UPON HAING AGAIN.

813
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
> SHANNON: YOU INVESTIGATED WHAT

814
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
HAPPENED AT VIRGINIA TECH.

815
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

816
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THE SETTINGS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT

817
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
IT'S A COMMONNALLITY OF SCHOOL.

818
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
>> AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- THE

819
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
CLASSIC EXAMPLE, YOU DON'T WANT

820
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TO TURN THE SCHOOL INTO A

821
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
FORTRESS.
THIS IS A SCHOOL, AS I

822
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
UNDERSTAND IT, THAT DID

823
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
EVERYTHING CONVEEFABLY POSSIBLE,

824
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
LIMIT THE ENTRANCE AND THE EXIT

825
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
WITH THE BUZZER.

826
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
THIS IS A SCHOOL, THE SCHOOL

827
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
GETS GREAT -- IT'S UNSPEAKABLE

828
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
TRAGEDY.
BUT ONE WONDERS WHAT HAPPENS IF

829
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE LOCKDOWN FTHE

830
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
AIDE DIDN'T CALL 911.

831
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
IF THE SCHOOL DIDN'T YELL

832
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
LOCKDOWN AND THE HEROINE WHO

833
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
PROTECTED HER KIDS.

834
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN DO.

835
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO SAY, WE

836
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
WANT TO TRY TO RESPOND AS BEST

837
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WE CAN.

838
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WE DON'T WANT TO TURN OUR

839
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
SCHOOLED -- SCHOOLS INTO ARMED

840
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
FORTRESSES.
IT IS NOT JUST ACCESS TO

841
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
WEAPONS, BUT WHO GETS THEM AND

842
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
WHY.
THIS EYE KNOW THIS IS BASIC --

843
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THIS IS BASIC.

844
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN EVIL OR

845
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
VIOLENT.

846
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
BUT THEY MAY BEGIN WITH

847
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES AND A

848
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
VARIETY OF INFLUENCES AND

849
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
EXPERIENCES TAKE THEM IN THAT

850
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
PATH.

851
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT AND ALSO

852
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

853
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
CULLURE, IMPORTANCE THE

854
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
INTERVENTION, IMPORTANCE OF

855
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
MENTAL HEALTH.

856
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THERE WERE MANY LESSONS IN

857
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
VIRGINIA TECH, PRIVACY LAWS WERE

858
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
CONFUSED, THE MENTAL HEALTH

859
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
SYSTEM, THIS MAN HAD A

860
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DETERIORATING MENTAL CONDITION,

861
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT TNOBODY

862
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
RESPONDED TO IT.

863
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THIS IS A LOT MORE THAN SENATOR

864
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
FEINSTEIN'S GOING TO DO

865
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
LEGISLATION WITH REGARD TO

866
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
REGULATIONS ON GUN CONTROL.

867
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THAT'S AS PREDICTABLE AS THE SUN

868
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
COMING UP TOMORROW.

869
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
BUT THERE IS A LOT MORE TO DO

870
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THEN THAN A SINGLE PIECE OF

871
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
LEGISLATION.

872
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>>
> SHANNON: AND A RESPONSIBILITY.

873
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000

WELL, THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF

WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN OUR

882
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THINKING AND WE HAVE TO GET AWAY

883
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
FROM THE NOTION THAT THERE IS

884
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
JUST A SINGLE WAY WE CAN REDUCE

885
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THE THREAT OF THIS CONTINUING

886
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000

A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT VIAGRA.

20 MILLION MEN ALREADY HAVE.

928
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
ASK IF YOUR HEART
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

929
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN;

930
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

931
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
HEADACHE, FLUSHING,

932
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
UPSET STOMACH,
AND ABNORMAL VISION.

933
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

934
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
FOR AN ERECTION
LASTING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

935
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
STOP TAKING VIAGRA
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

936
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
IF YOU EXPERIENCE
A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS

937

OF TAKING ACTION.

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000

IS RIGHT FOR YOU.

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I just served my mother-in-law
your Chicken Noodle soup

944
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but she loved it so much...
I told her it was homemade.

945
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Everyone tells
a little white lie now and then.

946
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But now she wants
my recipe

CONDUCTING THOSE.

994
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THEY ARE IMPROVING SECURITY IN

995
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
TERMS OF WHAT THE PARENTS AND

996
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
TEACHERS ARE THINKING.

997
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
YOU WOULD THINK THE PARENTS OR

998
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
TEACHERS WOULD BE CALLING FOR

999
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
TOUGHER SECURITY MEASURES.

YESTERDAY, THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

1002
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
GAVE US THESE RESPONSES.

1003

>> FROM WHAT I SEE, MOST SCHOOLS

1004
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
HAVE THE PROPER PROTOCOLS AND IT

1005
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
WAS JUST AN UNFORTUNATE...

1006
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
TRAGEDY.
>> SHORT OF LOCKING THEM IN,

1007
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

1008

AND THEY HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL

1013
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
ISSUES, YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT?

1015
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000

KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR

1020

KIDS' MIND?

1021
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
IT'S HARD TO POLICE THE THOUGHTS

1022
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
OF PEOPLE.
THEY ARE TALKING NOW ABOUT

1023
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
BETTER FUNDING FOR SECURITY IN

1024
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000

FUNDING COMES FROM A NUMBER OF

1025
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS, BUT

1026
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
ONE THING THAT SECURITY EXPERTS

1027
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ARE POINTING OUT IS THAT THERE

1028
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
NEEDS TO BE A COORDINATED

1029
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
NATIONAL POLICY INFORMED THAT

1030
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
ENSURES EVERYONE'S INVOLVED HERE

1031
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
IN PROTECTING SCHOOLS, AND THAT

1032
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
MEANS GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND

1033
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
FEDERAL LEVEL AND EMERGENCY

1034
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000

1037
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
RESPONSE TASHOULD HAVE TAKEN

1038

CRIME IN AMERICA HAS MORE THAN

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000

IT'S COME DOWN FROM ITS WORST IN

THE LATE 80s AND EARLY TO

1068
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
MID 90s.
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 1.2

MILLION VIOLENT CRIMES A YEAR.

1070
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
ALMOST 15,000 MURDERS A YEAR.

1071

MISSING ELEMENT OF THE COVERAGE

1084
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
SO FAR.

ALTHOUGH I HOPE, GOING FORWARD,

1086
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE

1087
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
SPIRITUAL ISSUES BECAUSE IN THE

1088
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
END, THIS ISN'T PRIMARILY A GUN

1089
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
CONTROL OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE,

1090
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT SHOULD

1091
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
BE DISCUSSED.

1092
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MORAL

1093
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
AND SPIRITUAL DISARMAMENT.

1094
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING GOD OUT,

1095
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
SAYING CHRIST SHOULDN'T BE IN

1096
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
SCHOOLS.
MOST OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, WE

1097
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
SAY THAT WE ARE CHRISTIAN, 85%

1098
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE

1099
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
CHRISTIANS.

1100
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
YET, WE ARE SEEING THIS

1101
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
METASTASIZING OF VIOLENCE AND

1102
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
EVIL IN OUR SOCIETY.

1103
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
AND OUR KIDS ARE CONFUSED.

1104
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000

IN THE FACE OF A NATIONAL

1285
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
TRAGEDY.

NOW WE ARE HEARING THAT THE

JUST MAYBE AT A DIFFERENT

SCHOOL.

1299
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT

1300
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

1301
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
CERTAINLY, IT'S ONE OF THE

1302
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
THINGS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

1303
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
TO LOOK INTO.

1304
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
WE WANT TO KEEP THESE KIDS

1305
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
TOGETHER.

1306
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
THEY NEED SUPPORT OF EACH

1307
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
OTHER.

1308
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000

1323
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
KIND OF A TIME LINE FROM THEM.

1324
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
WE DID HEAR TODAY FROM

1325
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR DANO

1327
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

1328
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE

1329
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
SHOOTER'S SUICIDE.

1330
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
>>

1331
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
>> WE SURMISE IT WAS DURING

THAT HE HEARD RESPONDERS

1335
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
DECIDED TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

1336
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000

STATE POLICE SAID THAT THERE

1340
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
ARE TWO SUFFER ADVISORS.

1341
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
TWO ADULT SURVIVORS OF

1342
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
FRIDAY'S SHOOTING.

1343
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE SECOND

1344
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
SURVIVOR IS.
WE HAD HEARD INITIALLY THAT

1345
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON

1346
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
BEING TREATED AT A LOCAL

1347
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
HOSPITAL FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1348
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
WE ARE NOW HEARING THAT THERE

1349
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
IS A SECOND PERSON WHO

1350
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
SURVIVED.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

1351
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
INJURIES THEY HAVE.

1352
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF
THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED.

1353
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
WE WILL TRY TO TRACK THAT DOWN

1354
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
AND KEEP YOU UPDATED.

1355
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
BACK TO YOU.

1356
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
>> Shannon: THANKS FOR THE
UPDATES, PETER.

1357
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
FOR MORE INSIGHT ON THE

1358
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
INVESTIGATION, WE ARE JOINED

1359
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
BY FORMER HOMICIDE DETECTIVE

1360
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ROD

1361
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
WHEELER.

1362
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TODAY.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

1363
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
>> Shannon: I WANT TO START

1364
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
WITH THE INFORMATION PETER HAD

1365
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
THERE.
IT IS RELATIVELY NEW TO US

1366
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
THAT THERE WERE TWO ADULT

1367
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
SURVIVORS.
HOW WHAT THEY DID OR DIDN'T

1368
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
SEE.
HOW CRITICAL COULD THEY BE IN

1369
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
PIECING TOGETHER THESE EVENTS?

1370
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
>> THEY WILL BE VERY CRITICAL.

1371
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I GUARANTEE THEY HAVE BEEN AND

1372
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL IN THIS

1373
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
EGGS HAVE A.
THINK 'IT, THESE ARE ADULTS,

1374
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
EITHER IT'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY

1375
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
THAT MAYBE THEY EVEN

1376
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
RECOGNIZED WHO THIS GUY WAS

1377
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
BUT THEY CAN AT LEAST PROVIDE

1378
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
THE POLICE WITH SOME ABSOLUTE

1379
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
INFORMATION.
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE

1380
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
VERY CRITICAL THROUGH THE THIS

1381
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.
>> POLICE HAVE SHARED VERY

1382
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
LITTLE WHAT THEY COULD WITH US

1383
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
SO FAR.

1384
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
BUT YOU ARE VERY EXPERIENCED.

1385
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU

1386
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
HAVE HEARD SO FAR, ANY CLUES,

1387
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
THINGS THAT CATCH YOUR

1388
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
ATTENTION AS A FORMER

1389
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
DETECTIVE?
>> YES.

1390
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
ACTUALLY THERE HAS BEEN A
NUMBER OF CLUES THAT I HAVE

1391
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
PICKED UP ON, ESPECIALLY ON

1392
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
FRIDAY, SHANNON THERE WAS ONE

1393
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
PARTICULAR CLUE THAT I PICKED

1394
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
UP ON, ACTUALLY WAS BROUGHT TO

1395
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
MY ATTENTION BY NEIL CAVUTO.

1396
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
HE ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT

1397
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
SOMETHING.
REAL QUICKLY WHAT HE SAID YOU

1398
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
KNOW, THE SUSPECT HE HAD HIS

1399
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
BROTHER'S DRIVER'S LICENSE ON

1400
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
HIM.
REMEMBER, THAT WAS EVEN

1401
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
ANNOUNCED.
BUT IF YOU WILL RECALL THE

1402
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
POLICE THOUGHT THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR TWO SUSPECTS.

1403
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
REMEMBER?
BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS ONE GUY.

1404
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
NOW HIS BROTHER'S NAME IS

1405
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
RYAN.
THAT'S WHO THEY THOUGHT THEY

1406
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
HAD.
AT THE SAME TIME THEY THOUGHT

1407
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER

1408
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
PERSON, ADAM.

1409
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
BUT ACTUALLY THIS WAS ADAM,

1410
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
THE BAD GUY.

1411
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
WHO APPARENTLY SOMEONE AT THAT

1412
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
SCHOOL MUST HAVE RECOGNIZED

1413
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
THIS PERSON AS BEING ADAM.

1414
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
THE PERSON WHO WAS DOING THE

1415
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
SHOOTING.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, IF YOU

1416
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
KNOW THE SECURITY SYSTEM HAD

1417
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
RECENTLY BEEN UPGRADED AT THE

1418
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
SCHOOL.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A

1419
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
CONSEQUENCE, SHANNON THAT THAT

1420
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
HAPPENED.
I THINK THIS GUY HAD

1421
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
PREVIOUSLY MADE A THREAT OF

1422
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
SOME TYPE TO SOMEONE AT THAT

1423
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHY HE DID

1424
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
IT.
THE OTHER QUESTION FOR THE DAY

1425
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
IS, WHEN WAS THE MOTHER

1426
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
ACTUALLY KILLED?

1427
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
NOW, WE KNOW HER BODY WAS

1428
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
FOUND ON FRIDAY MORNING.
BUT WHEN WAS SHE KILLED?

1429
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
AND I CAN TELL YOU LATER ON

1430
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE

1431
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
SOME TIME BECAUSE THAT'S

1432
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
SIGNIFICANT IN THIS

1433
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
INVESTIGATION IF SHE WAS

1434
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
KILLED A DAY OR TWO PRIOR TO

1435
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
THE SHOOTING ON FRY PLAY.

1436
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
PEOPLE HAVE HAD SO MANY

1437
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT.
THERE IS JUST NO GOOD ANSWER

1438
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
FOR WHY SOME INNOCENT CHILDREN

1439
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
AND INNOCENT ADULTS EITHER.

1440
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
BUT YOU ARE SAYING YOU THINK

1441
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF

1442
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
CONNECTION WITH THIS

1443
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
PARTICULAR SCHOOL?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1444
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
HE HAD TO HAVE A CONNECTION

1445
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
WITH THE SCHOOL.

1446
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
WHY?
BECAUSE SHOOTERS SUCH AS THIS,

1447
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
THEY SELECT THEIR TARGETS,

1448
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THESE

1449
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
AREN'T JUST RANDOM EVENTS

1450
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
WHERE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO

1451
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAY

1452
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'M GOING TO GO TO IT A SCHOOL

1453
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
AND SHOOT 26 PEOPLE.

1454
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
THEY PICK THEIR TARGETS FOR A

1455
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
REASON.
WHETHER IT WAS A BERNE.

1456
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
A LOT OF TIMES RELATED TO A

1457
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
DOMESTIC SITUATION.
THEY SPECIFICALLY CHOOSE THEIR

1458
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
TARGETS.
NOW, A WILL THE OF PEOPLE HAVE

1459
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
BEEN ASKING, SHANNON, WHY WE

1460
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
KILL HIS MOTHER?

1461
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
REAL QUICKLY, I THINK THE

1462
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
MOTHER, SHANNON, WAS IN THE

1463
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
PROCESS OF HAVING HIM

1464
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
PROBATED.

1465
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
PROBATED MEANS THAT THIS GUY

1466
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
HAS SOME KIND OF MENTION

1467
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
PROBLEMS.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE

1468
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
HOSPITAL.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE HIS

1469
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
MEDICATION.
SO A FAMILY MEMBER HAS TO BE

1470
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
THE ONE TO INITIATE THE

1471
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
PROCESS SO THE POLICE CAN COME

1472
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
OUT AND GET HIM.

1473
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I THINK HE FELT LIKE HIS

1474
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
MOTHER WAS BETRAYING HIM.

1475
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
THAT'S WHY HE KILLED HIS

1476
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
MOTHER.

1477
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO

1478
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
THE SCHOOL TO SOMEWHAT GET

1479
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
EVEN WITH THE FOLKS AT THE

1480
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
SCHOOL.

1481
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
>> Shannon: OKAY.

1482
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE, DO YOU
THINK, BEFORE PUBLICLY WE WILL

1483
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
HAVE SOME OF THESE PUZZLE

1484
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
PIECES TO KNOW IF THESE

1485
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
THEORIES ARE ON THE RIGHT

1486
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
TRACK?
>> IT COULD TAKE AT LEAST A

1487
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
WEEK IF NOT LONGER.

1488
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I THINK THE POLICE ALREADY

1489
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
KNOW MOST OF THE ANSWERS TO

1490
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
AWFUL THESE THINGS I'M SAYING.

1491
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE VERY

1492
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
CAUTIOUS RIGHT NOW.

1493
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
THIS IS STILL A CRIMINAL

1494
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
INVESTIGATION EVEN THOUGH WE

1495
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
HAVE THE SUSPECT, IS HE DEAD.

1496
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
THEY STILL HAVE TO DO THEIR

1497
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
DUE DILIGENCE.

1498
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WEEK OR

1499
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
LONGER BEFORE THEY COME OUT

1500
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING

1501
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
ON.

1502
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
>> Shannon: POSSIBLE BEFORE

1503
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
THEY PUT TOGETHER THE PIECES

1504
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
OF THIS THAT THERE ARE LESSONS

1505
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
THAT POLICE CAN THEN SHARE TO

1506
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
HELP PREVENT OTHER TRAGEDIES

1507
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
SIMILAR TO THIS?

1508
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1509
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARN THE
HARD WAY IN THIS COUNTRY.

1510
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
OBVIOUSLY WE LEARNED FROM

1511
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
COLUMBINE.

1512
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
WE LEARNED FROM THE AURORA,

1513
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
COLORADO SHOOTING.

1514
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN FROM

1515
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
THIS.
THAT COMMUNITY, WE AS A

1516
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
NATION, WE WILL MOVE ON FROM

1517
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
THIS.
WE WILL BECOME STRONGER AND

1518
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
HOPEFULLY PREVENT THESE

1519
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
HORRIFIC THINGS FROM HAPPENING

1520
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
AGAIN.

1521
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
>> ROD WHEELER, ALWAYS GOOD TO

1522
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
SEE YOU, THANK YOU.

1523
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
>> GOOD TO HE SUE, TOO

1524
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
SHANNON.

1525
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
>> Shannon: THE DAD OF THE
6-YEAR-OLD EMILY PARKER WAS

1526
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
ONE OF THE FIRST PARENTS TO

1527
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT THE

1528
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
SHOOTING.
HE DESCRIBES HIS DAUGHTER AS A

1529
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
HAPPY LITTLE GIRL WHO LIKED TO

1530
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
MAKE CARDS AND ALMOST ALWAYS

1531
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
CARRIED COLORED PENCILS OR

1532
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
MARKERS.

1533
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
SHE SAID SHE LOVED HER LITTLE

1534
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
SISTERS AND CHEERING UP HER

1535
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
SAD FRIENDS.
HE DESCRIBED HIS LAST MOMENTS

1536
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
WITH HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER

1537
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
FRIDAY MORNING.
THEY HAD BEEN LEARNING TO

1538
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
SPEAK PORTUGUESE.

1539
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE LOVED

1540
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
HIM AND HE GAVE HER A KISS.

1541
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
>> MY DAUGHTER, EMILY, WOULD

1542
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1543
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE

1544
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
AND SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE

1545
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
VICTIMS.

1546
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1547
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

1548
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

1549
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I WOULD HAVE

1550
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
DONE BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

1551
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
GIFTS GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1552
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1553
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
>> PARKER EXPRESSED SYMPATHY

1554
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
FOR THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER.

1555
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
HE SENT LOVE FROM HIS FAMILY

1556
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
TO THEIRS.

SYMPATHIES TO THE FAMILIES.

1624
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
IT HAS TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT

1625
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
TIME.

1626
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
ESPECIALLY RIGHT BEFORE

1627
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
CHRISTMAS, SO, AGAIN, MY

BERRY TO YOU AS WELL?

1633

PRAYERS ARE FOCUSED ON THOSE

1635
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
WITH CONNECTICUT.

1636
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I HAVE QUOTE TO SAY I AM TRULY

1637
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
AMAZED AT THE POISE AND THE

1638
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
GRACE OF THAT FATHER UP IN

1639
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
CONNECTICUT.

1640
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I THINK THE WAY HE PROCHED

1641
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
THIS IS A GOOD LESSON FOR ALL

1642
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
OF WHEN YOU SAY WE FACE

1643
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

1644
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
VERY INSPIRING.

1645
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1646
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
WELL, LET'S TURN TO THE

1647
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
BUSINESS OF THE DAY OR OF THIS

1648
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
WEEK I SHOULD SAY.

1649
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
CONGRESSMAN THERE WILL BE

1650
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
HEARINGS ON BOTH HOUSE AND

1651
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
SENATE SIDE ON BENGHAZI.

1652
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
SECRETARY CLINTON WON'T BE

1653
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
PRESENT.

1654
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
ARE YOU CONFIDENT YOU CAN
ANSWER ANSWERS FROM THOSE IN

1655
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
HER PLACE?

1656
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
>> AGAIN, I'M SURE THERE IS

1657
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
SOMEBODY THERE THAT CAN

1658
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
TESTIFY.

1659
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I KNOW THEY WANTED TO HEAR

1660
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
FROM SECRETARY CLINTON BUT

1661
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULD NOT DO

1662
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
IT.

1663
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I HOPE SHE GETS BETTER.

1664
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
BUT, AGAIN, THERE WILL BE

1665
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
OTHER FOLKS THAT CAN ANSWER

1666
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
THAT QUESTION.

1667
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE ONLY

1668
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
HEARING.
ERE CAN BE OTHER HEARINGS IN

1669
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
THE FUTURE, ALSO.

1670
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
>> AND, CONGRESSMAN THORN

1671
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
BERRY, HOW ABOUT YOU?

1672
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I KNOW THERE WOULD WILL BE A

1673
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
CLOSED BRIEFING FOR SOME

1674
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
MEMBERS.
ALSO THE PLUCK HEARINGS DO YOU

1675
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
THINK YOU WILL MAKE PROGRESS

1676
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
THIS WEEK?
>> I THINK WE WILL MAKE

1677
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
PROGRESS.
THERE ARE STILL A THE OF

1678
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1679
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES INVOLVE

1680
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
SECURITY PREPARATIONS BEFORE

1681
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
THE ATTACK SOME OF THOSE

1682
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
QUESTIONS INVOLVE WHO DID WHAT

1683
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
DURING THE ATTACK.

1684
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS

1685
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
INVOLVE THE POLITICAL SPIN OR

1686
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
THE WAY IT WAS PORTRAYED AFTER

1687
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
THE ATTACK.

1688
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I THINK THIS WEEK IS REALLY

1689
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
FOCUSED ON THE PREPARATIONS

1690
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
BEFORE THE ATTACK.

1691
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE REPORT OF

1692
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
A COMMISSION AND THEY WILL

1693
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
TELL US WHAT THEY FOUND.

1694
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
BUT AT SOME POINT I THINK IT'S

1695
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE

1696
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND

1697
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
THE HOUSE WOULD WANT TO HEAR

1698
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE

1699
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
DIRECTLY ABOUT DIPLOMATIC

1700
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
SECURITY GENERALLY AND ABOUT

1701
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
THE SITUATION IN LIBYA IN

1702
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
PARTICULAR IT.

1703
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
>> THERE ARE ALSO ALONG WITH

1704
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
THE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES THAT

1705
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
YOU WERE LOOKING INTO,

1706
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
DOMESTIC ISSUES AS WELL, MOST

1707
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
NOTABLY THE FISCAL CLIFF

1708
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
THAT'S COMING.

1709
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO GET

1710
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
YOUR REACTION TO REPORTS LAST

1711
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
NIGHT THAT HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

1712
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
BOEHNER HAS INDICATED THAT HE

1713
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
MAY BE OKAY WITH RAISING TOP

1714
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
RATES ON THOSE WHO EARN A

1715
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE.

1716
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
THIS EXCHANGE FOR SOME SERIOUS

1717
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
CUTS ELSEWHERE.

1718
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
>> AGAIN, LOOK, WE HAVE TO GET

1719
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
TOGETHER, BOTH DEMOCRATS AND

1720
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
REPUBLICANS, WE HAVE TO GET

1721
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
TOGETHER DO THIS FOR THE GOOD

1722
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
OF THE COUNTRY.

1723
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
IT'S DIFFICULT.

1724
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I NO THOUGH IT IS.

1725
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I VOTED FOR THE EXTENSION OF

1726
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
THE GEORGE BUSH TAX CUTS.

1727
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

1728
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
DO BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL

1729
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
EXTENDING THE GEORGE BUSH TAX

1730
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
CUTS WERE ONLY TEMPORARY AND,

1731
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
OF COURSE, WE HAVE NOW GOT THE

1732
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
SAYS QUESTIONS STATION.

1733
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS

1734
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND

1735
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I THINK WE DID TOO THIS IT.

1736
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
>> Shannon: CONGRESSMAN THORN

1737
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
BERRY AS A REPUBLICAN ARE YOU

1738
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
OKAY WITH THAT DEAL?

1739
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I ASKED YOUR COLLEAGUE

1740
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
CONGRESSMAN PETE KING EARLIER,

1741
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
HE SAID HE WOULD BE ON BOARD

1742
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
WITH WHATEVER THE SPEAKER

1743
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
NEGOTIATED.

1744
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
IS THAT TRUE FOR YOU, ALSO?

1745
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
>> I THINK ALL OF US SUPPORT

1746
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
THE SPEAKER IN HAVING ONE

1747
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
NEGOTIATOR.
BUT ETCH AUTO OF US IS GOING

1748
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
TO HAVE TO EVALUATE WHATEVER

1749
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
WE -- IS PRESENT TO US FOR A

1750
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
VOTE.
WE CAN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL WE

1751
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
SEE IT.

1752
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST

1753
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
EMPHASIZE ONE NUMBER WITH ALL

1754
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
THE BLIZZARD OF NUMBERS GOING

1755
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
AROUND, ONE NUMBER IS 20.6.

1756
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II,

1757
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
TOTAL TAX REVENUE COMING INTO

1758
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN

1759
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
MORE THAN 20.6.

1760
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
AND, YET, SPENDING IS MORE

1761
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
LIKE 24% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC

1762
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
PRODUCT.
THE POINT IS WHATEVER YOU DO

1763
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
ON TAXES, AND THERE MAY WELL

1764
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
HAVE TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY ON

1765
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
IT.
BUT WHATEVER DO YOU ON TAXES,

1766
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS SPENDING,

1767
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE

1768
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
DEFICIT AND DEBT.

1769
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
>> CONGRESSMAN THORN BERRY,

BEHIND THE SCENES.

1788
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS REJECTED

1789
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000

REPUBLICANS OFFERED A DEAL

1792

$1 MILLION A YEAR.

1795
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR DEEPER

1796
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
SPENDING CUTS.
THAT WAS A NO-GO FOR PRESIDENT

1797
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
OBAMA.

1798
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000

ON TAX HIKES.

1806
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
REPUBLICANS SAY THE COUNTRY

1807
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
HAS TO GET SPENDING UNDER

1808
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'RE

1820
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
HOPEFUL.

01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
HIS LEFT WING IS ALREADY

1831
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
SIGNALING THEY WON'T STAND FOR

1832
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
IT.

1833
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY

1834
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
PELOSI SAID LAST WEEK THAT

1835
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
RAISING THE MEDICARE AGE,

1836
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
QUOTE:  DOESN'T WORK.
IT DOESN'T HAVE PLUCK SUPPORT,

1837
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
IT'S UNFAIR.

1838
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
AND IT DOESN'T LOWER HEALTH

1839
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
EXPENDITURES.

1840
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS SCHEDULED TO

1841
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
TRAVEL TO MAINE THIS WEEK TO

1842
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
PUSH FOR HIS FISCAL CLIFF

1843
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
PLAN.
THAT TRIP HAS BEEN CANCELLED

1844
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
BECAUSE OF THE CONNECTICUT

1845
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1846
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
SHANNON?

1847
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
>> MOLLY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1848
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
ALL RIGHT.

1849
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE

1850
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
TO SPEAK OUT ON SPEAKER

1851
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
BOEHNER'S PLAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1852
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
IS THIS PROMISING PROGRESS OR

1853
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
SHOULD HE STAND HIS GROUND?

1854
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
FOR YOUR ANSWERS TO ACT ANHQDC

1855
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
OR AT SHANNON BREAM OR WE WILL

1856
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
READ SOME OF THEM LATER IN HAD

1857
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
HOUR.
LAST MONTH NEARLY 2,000

1858
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
FEDERAL REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN

1859
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
POSTED BY THE OBAMA

1860
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
ADMINISTRATION BUT IT'S BEEN
MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE THE

1861
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
ADMINISTRATION REPORTED THE

1862
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THOSE

1863
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
REGULATIONS TO CONGRESS AS

1864
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
REQUIRED BY LAW.

1865
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
ISSUES AND HOW MUCH IT COULD

1866
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
COST YOU AFTER THIS BREAK.
This holiday, Share Everything.

1867
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Share "Not even close."

1868
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Share "You owe me..."

1869
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Share "Just right."

1870
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
The Share Everything Plan.

1871
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Shareable data across 10 devices

1872
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000

1873
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Hurry in for a

1874
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000

1875
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
>> IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN A

1876
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
YEAR SINCE THE OBAMA

1877
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
ADMINISTRATION COMPLIED WITH A

1878
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
LAW THAT REQUIRES FEDERAL
AGENCIES TO PLUCKILY REPORT

1879
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT WILL

1880
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

1881
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
IMPACT DIRECTLY TO CONGRESS.

1882
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
NOW, THOUGH THAT HASN'T

1883
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
HAPPENED.
WE KNOW THAT OVER JUST THE

1884
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
LAST 90 DAYS, 5994 PROPOSED

1885
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED.

1886
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE

1887
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OWN WEB

1888
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
SITE.

1889
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT

1890
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
REGULATION NATION THIS WEEK.

1891
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
DIRECTOR OF REGULATORY POLICY

1892
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
AT THE AMERICAN ACTION FORUM.

1893
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
SAM, THANKS FOREVER COMING IN

1894
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
TODAY.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

1895
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
>> YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES A

1896
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
GOOD JOB OF TRACKING HOW MANY

1897
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
REGULATIONS ARE OUT THERE.

1898
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TOst DO.

1899
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
THE REAL IMPACT OF IT.

1900
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
NOW ALL THESE REGULATIONS

1901
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
GENERALLY GO THROUGH THE WHITE

1902
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
HOUSE TO BE VETTED IN SOME WAY

1903
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
BEFORE THEY COME OUT.

1904
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
A LOT OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN

1905
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
STUCK THERE THIS YEAR.

1906
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1907
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
>> THERE IS DEFINITELY A

1908
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
REGULATORY LAW JAM.

1909
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
WE LOOKED AT A SIMILAR PERIOD

1910
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
IN 2004 WHEN THERE WAS A

1911
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
RE-ELECTION.

1912
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
THAT WHITE HOUSE REVIEWED MORE

1913
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
REGULATIONS IN HALF THE AMOUNT

1914
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
OF TIME.
THE AVERAGE REVIEW TIME FOR

1915
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE SO

1916
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
100 MILLION PLUS ROLE 70 DAYS

1917
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
FOR THE FIRST 10 MONTHS.

1918
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
OVER 100 RULES THAT HAVE BEEN

1919
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE LONGER THAN

1920
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
NIBILITY DAYS WHICH IS A LONG

1921
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
TIME CONSIDERING THAT MOST

1922
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
SPEND 30 TO 60 DAYS THERE.

1923
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
THERE IS A LOT BUILT UP AT THE

1924
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
>> YOU ARE SAYING WE KNOW AS

1925
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
WE REPORTED THAT THE FEDERAL

1926
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
AGENCIES HAVEN'T REPORTED AS

1927
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
THEY ARE REQUIRED TO IN APRIL

1928
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
AND OCTOBER BY CONGRESS ABOUT

1929
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
THESE.

1930
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
WE KNOW THERE IS A BACKLOG AT

1931
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1932
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING

1933
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
BASED ON EVERYTHING GOING ON

1934
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
RIGHT NOW REGULATORY CLIFF.

1935
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE

1936
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
NEED TO BE WATCHING.

1937
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
>> SURE, SENATOR HAD OP. ED

1938
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
ABOUT THIS REGULATORY CLIFF.

1939
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
WE COUNTED UP ALL OF THE COSTS

1940
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
RULES THAT COULD COME OUT OR

1941
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
THAT ARE CURRENTLY AT THE

1942
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
WHITE HOUSE.
IT'S ROUGHLY $100 BILLION

1943
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
WORTH OF RULES.

1944
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANT RULES FOR

1945
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS

1946
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RULES.

1947
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
THERE IS A LOT AT THE WHITE
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

1948
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A

1949
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
HUGE AVALANCHE OF RULES THEY

1950
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
CAN TAKE THEIR TIME AND GET

1951
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
EVERYONE IS HOPING AT LEAST

1952
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
INPUT FROM BUSINESSES AND

1953
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
GROUPS TO MAKE THESE RULES.

1954
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
AT LEAST THE LEAST COSTLY

1955
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
RULES THAT ACHIEVE THE MOST

1956
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
BENEFITS OR RE-EXAMINE THE

1957
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
RULES ALL TOGETHER.

1958
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
>> Shannon: WE HAVE COVERED A

1959
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
LOT OF THINGS.

1960
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
E.P.A. RULES THAT INFRINGE ON

1961
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
PEOPLE'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.

1962
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
OF COURSE, THE MANDATE ABOUT

1963
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
CONTRACEPTION BEING MANDATED

1964
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1965
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
IMPACT BUSINESSES PROPERTY

1966
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
PROPERTY OWNERS.
YOU ALL TRACK A NUMBER OF

1967
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
THOSE.
ONE CHIEF AMONG THOSE IS THE

1968
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
NEW HEALTHCARE LAW.

1969
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
ALL RULES AND HASN'T GONE INTO

1970
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
EFFECT YET.

1971
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
$1.1 BILLION.

1972
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
AND 1.4 MILLION PAPERWORK

1973
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
HOURS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO

1974
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
KEEP UP WITH THESE

1975
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE DOES THAT

1976
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
COST FILTER TO SOMEWHERE IT

1977
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
ABSORBED.

1978
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
>> 1.1 FIGURES FOR THE VENDING

1979
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
MACHINES AND RESTAURANTS AND

1980
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
EXPANDED TO GROCERY STORES.

1981
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
THE TOTAL COST IS ROUGHLY

1982
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
$30 BILLION.

1983
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
10.
>> ALL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

1984
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
ACT.
CORRECT.

1985
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
ONE WAY TO TAKE THESE

1986
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
PAPERWORK HOURS IS TO SEE AN

1987
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
AVERAGE WORK YEAR OF ROUGHLY

1988
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
2,000 HOURS AND YOU ARE

1989
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
TALKING ABOUT TENS OF

1990
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEE YEARS

1991
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
THAT WOULD TAKE JUST TO FILE

1992
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
ALL THE NEW PAPERWORK THAT THE

1993
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
HEALTHCARE LAW REQUIRES THERE

1994
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
IS A LOT MORE TO COME IN 2013,

1995
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
2014 AS WELL.
>> WHAT DO BUSINESS OWNERS DO

1996
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
WITH THAT COST?

1997
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
>> THEY CAN EITHER

1998
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
REDISTRIBUTE LABOR TO

1999
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WHICH IS

2000
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
SOMETHING I DON'T THINK

2001
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
EVERYONE WANT IT COULD.

2002
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
FORCED TO HIRE NEW PEOPLE.

2003
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
YOU HAVE TO EXAMINE FOR SMALL

2004
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
BUSINESSES THAT IMPACT IS MUCH

2005
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
GREATER.

2006
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
WE LOOKED AT A FEW LAWS UNDER

2007
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
DODD FRANK A FEW REGULATIONS

2008
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
WE SAW 4,000 PLUS HOURS PER

2009
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
ENTITY FOR A FEW OF THE BIG

2010
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
REGULATIONS.

01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

2290
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000

DICK DURBIN AND LIEBERMAN

2332
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000

01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
FIND WAYS OF PREVENTING FUTURE

2335
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.
AND SOME ARE POINTING TO A

2336
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000

CAREFUL ABOUT SUGGESTING NEW

2341
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
GUN LAWS.

2342
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT DRIVES

2343
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
A CRAZY PERSON TO DO THESE

2344
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
KIND OF ACTIONS.

2345
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

2346
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT ARE

2347
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000

2357
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000

2359
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
GOVERNMENTS MIGHT WANT TO DO

2360
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000

HEART BREAK AND ANGER THAT WE

2362
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000

2363
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
OVER TIME OR LOST IN

2364
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000

01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
PESSIMISTIC.

SAYS THE ELECTION JUST DIDN'T

2753
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
GIVE THOSE SURVEYED ANY REASON

2754
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
TO HOPE THINGS MIGHT GET

2755
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
BETTER.

2756
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
>> WE WOKE UP AFTER SPENDING

2757
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
BILLIONS ON THE ELECTION AND

2758
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME.

2759
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
AND SINCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO

2760
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000

PESSIMISTIC THAT THEY WILL BE

2764
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
ABLE TO DO IT NOW.
>> SMALL BUSINESS WHICH

2765
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
LARGELY DRIVES HIRING IS

2766
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
PESSIMISTIC, THAT COULD BE A

2767
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY.
>> WITH THAT KIND OF OUTLOOK

2768
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000

HELP GROW G.D.P. AND BOOST THE

2772
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
