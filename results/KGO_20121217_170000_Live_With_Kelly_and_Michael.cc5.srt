GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MICHAEL: GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TODAY IS MONDAY, DECEMBER 17,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
2012.
KELLY: THAT'S RIGHT.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
VERY ROUGH AND DIFFICULT WEEKEND

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
FOR ALL OF US ACROSS THE NATION.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AS PARENTS AND AS HUMAN BEINGS,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
WE CANNOT REALLY IGN IGNORE THE

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
COVER OF EVERY NEWSPAPER HERE.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
OF COURSE, THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA GOING TO

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TO VISIT

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE YOUNG,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
TINY 6 AND 7-YEAR-OLD VICTIMS.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
AND THE HEROIC TEACHERS AND

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
PRINCIPAL THAT REALLY, I THINK

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
DID SO MUCH TO NOT JUST PROTECT

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
SCHOOL, BUT ALSO TO -- WELL,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IN

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
SOME CASES.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
AND SO, I THINK THAT WHEN YOU

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
SAY THAT A COUNTRY IS PRAYING

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
TOGETHER, WE REALLY, I THINK ALL

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
ARE PRAYING TOGETHER.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AND ACROSS THE BOARDS, YOU SEE

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
HERE THAT OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IS SAYING THAT HE WILL -- THIS

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
IS FINALLY GOING TO START THAT

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT TOUGHER GUN

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
LAWS.
MICHAEL: IT WILL OPEN UP THE

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
DIALOGUE ABOUT TOUGHER GUN LAWS.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I THINK THIS IS JUST SOMETHING

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THAT'S BEEN DEVASTATING TO

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
EVERYBODY.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
COMING TO WORK THIS MORNING, I'M

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THINKING YOU KNOW, IT STILL

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AND I DON'T THINK IT EVER WILL.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WILL

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
EVER UNDERSTAND IT.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
BUT IT'S

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
STAY TOGETHER, AND HUG YOUR KIDS

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
AND ENJOY YOUR FAMILY AND JUST

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT IT.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
AS WELL.
KELLY: THAT'S THE THING.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
AS A PARENT AND AS A PERSON

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
LIVING IN THIS WORLD, I SORT OF

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
-- I DON'T EXPECT MUCH, BUT

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
HERE'S WHAT I EXPECT. TO SEND

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I EXPECT TO SEND MY KIDS TO

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
SCHOOL AND I EXPECT TO SEE THEM

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
MICHAEL: YES.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
KELLY: LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
EXPECT.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
AND WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
HAPPENS, IT JUST GRIPS YOU, IT

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
GRIPS YOU IN YOUR SOUL.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IT'S ALMOST A PARALYZING EFFECT

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
WHERE YOU THINK THIS IS A

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
NIGHTMARE THAT COLLECTIVELY,

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
COLLECTIVELY AS A SOCIETY THAT

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WE CANNOT WAKE UP FROM AND WE

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
CANNOT IGNORE IT.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I THINK TALKING TO CROUR

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
CHILDREN IS A VERY IMPORTANT

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THING.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AND I WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
NEWS.
I TRIED NOT TO -- I TRIED NOT TO

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
OVERINDULGE IN THE NEWS.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
MICHAEL: BUT IT WAS HARD NOT TO.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
KELLY: IT'S HARD NOT TO.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
MICHAEL: BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO
MAKE SENSE OF IT.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
ONE OF YOUR NATURAL THINGS, IS

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
TO EXPLORE, TO TRY TO FIGURE IT

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
OUT.
AND, THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
IN THE NEWS THAT WERE TRUE, A

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
LOT OF THINGS THAT WEREN'T TRUE.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AND WE -- LET'S GO TO LAURIE

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000

KELLY: SHE'S BEEN THERE ALL

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
MORNING.
THERE'S LAURIE.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
HEY LAURIE, HOW ARE YOU?

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
>> MORNING MICHAEL, MORNING

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
KELLY.

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
JUST LISTENING TO THE TWO OF YOU

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
TALK ABOUT TRYING TO STRUGGLE

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY,

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THE BLOODLETTING IN A FIRST

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
GRADE ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM, IN A

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000

ELEMENTARY HERE IN NEWTOWN,

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
CONNECTICUT.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
EVEN FOR AN ADULT, IT'S SO HARD

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
TO GRASP.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AND TO UNDERSTAND, AS YOU TALKED

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
ABOUT, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ABLE TO PUT YOUR CHILD ON A BUS

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
TO SCHOOL, OR DROP THEM OFF IN

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
FRONT OF THE SCHOOL, TO WATCH

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THEM WALK IN WITH THEIR

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
BACKPACK, HAVE THEM TURNAROUND

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
AND LOOK AT YOU AT SMILE AND

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE WHEN

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TO TELL UP AGAIN TO TELL YOU

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ABOUT THEIR DAY.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AND AS YOU SAID, IN THIS

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
PARTICULAR CASE, ON THAT DAY,

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
WHEN ALL THOSE CHILDREN WERE

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ESCORTED SO THE FIREHOUSE SO

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
CLOSE TO WHERE THEY HAD BEEN

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TRAINED, IN CASE OF AN

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
EMERGENCY, EVERYBODY GOES TO THE

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
FIREHOUSE THERE HERE IN NEWTOWN,

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
WHERE THEIR PARENTS WERE THEN

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TOLD, COME, YOU CAN COME

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
YOUR CHILD.

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
BUT FOR THOSE PARENTS WHO CAME

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TO THE FIRE HOUSE ON FRIDAY, AND

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
STOOD THERE AND THEIR CHILDREN

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DIDN'T COME, ONLY TO BE TOLD

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THAT YOUR CHILD ISN'T GOING TO

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
COME HOME AGAIN.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WE'RE STANDING AT A PARK, IT'S

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000

135
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME IS WHERE THE

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE HAVE

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BEEN HAVING THEIR PRESS

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
CONFERENCES TO UPDATE US ON

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THINGS.
YOU MENTIONED LAST NIGHT AT THE

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
VIGIL IN WHICH SO MANY CLERGY

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CAME TO TRY TO GIVE SOLACE AND

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
TIME OF GRIEF FOR THIS

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
COMMUNITY, AND SO MANY OTHER

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THING, IN CULMINATING WITH

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA COMING AT THE

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
END, AND SPEAKING, CLEARLY WE

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
UNDERSTAND HE WROTE, HE WAS THE

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
PRIMARY AUTHOR OF THE SPEECH

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THAT HE WROTE.
WE COULD TELL ON FRIDAY HOW THIS

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED HIM.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SO PROBABLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THESE WERE DEFINITELY HIS WORDS

153
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THAT WE HEARD LAST NIGHT.

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
HOW AT THE END WHEN HE READ THE

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
20 NAMES OF THOSE LITTLE

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
CHILDREN IN THAT FIRST GRADE WHO

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BECAME VICTIMS, ON THAT

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DAY.

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AND FOR THIS COMMUNITY, IT GAVE

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
GREAT SOLACE.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THEY'VE COME TOGETHER, THEY'RE

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
BROKEN, BUT THEY'RE DETERMINED

163
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
TO STAND UP.

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WITH, I WAS

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THINKING ABOUT HOW OVER THE

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WEEKEND, HOW NONE OF IT SEEMED

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
TO REALLY RESONATE.

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SORT OF WANDERED, YOU FIND

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
YOURSELF GOING BACK AND FORTH,

170
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
BECAUSE NONE OF IT SEEMED REAL.

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BUT TODAY THE REALITY REALLY

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
STARTS TO SET IN AS THIS TOWN IS

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
GOING TO BURY TWO OF THOSE FIRST

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GRADERS, 6 YEARS OLD, BOTH OF

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THEM.

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ONE, NOAH POSNER.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A LITTLE BOY WHO LIKED TO FIGURE

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THINGS OUT MECHANICALLY.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HIS UNCLE SAID HE KNEW HE WOULD

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
GROW UP TO BE A GREAT FATHER AND

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS WORLD AND BE

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A GOOD PERSON.

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AND THERE'S JACK PINTO WHO'S

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000

SO MUCH ABOUT, WHO LOVED,

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
MICHAEL, THE GIANTS.

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
AND WHO ALSO LOVED VICTOR CRUZ.

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
VICTOR PAID SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HIM, CALLING HIM HIS HERO.

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A CHANCE

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THAT THIS LITTLE BOY WILL BE

192
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
BURIED A JERSEY WITH THE NUMBER

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OF VICTOR CRUZ.

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
AND OF COURSE, WE STILL DON'T

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
OR NOT.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THE SAME TIME THE INVESTIGATION

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CONTINUES INTO THIS GUNMAN, 20

199
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
YEARS OLD.

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WHO, FIRST SLAUGHTERED HIS

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MOTHER AND THEN CAME TO THIS

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
SCHOOL.

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ARSENAL

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT HE HAD.

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THE FULL AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HE BROUGHT TO THIS SCHOOL AND SO

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
COWARDLY GUNNED DOWN THESE

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
BEAUTIFUL, INNOCENT LITTLE

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
CHILDREN.

216
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
LITTLE ONES WERE SAFE, ONLY TO

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
BE TOLD THAT THE WORST HAD

222
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
HAPPENED IN FACT.

223
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SO, THANK YOU FOR THE REPORTING

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000

MICHAEL: THANK YOU.

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GUYS.

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
MICHAEL: THANK YOU LORI.

HERE ABOUT TALKING TO YOUR KIDS.

231
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
KELLY: YEAH, YEAH.

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
SO I'VE BEEN SORT OF LIKE

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AGONIZING BECAUSE I HAVE KIDS IN

234
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THESE AGES, THEY REALLY ARE VERY

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
AWARE.
THEY'RE NOT TOO LITTLE, THEY'RE

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
VERY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AROUND THEM.

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
SO I WAS -- ALL OF THEIR SCHOOLS

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
PUT OUT SORT OF THESE WEBSITES

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
ON HOW TO TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN.

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THIS ONE IS COURTESY OF

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
"HUFFINGTON POST" AND IT SAID

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
YOU SHOULD A

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR CHILDREN IF

245
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THEY'RE OF A CERTAIN AGE, I

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THINK THAT RECOMMENDATION IS ANY

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
AGE ABOVE 7 IS LIKE A GOOD TIME

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
TO START THIS DIALOGUE.

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ASK THEM WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW.

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THE CHILDREN

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AND THE TEACHERS IN THAT SCHOOL

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
DID NOTHING WRONG.

253
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
HABITS.
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE SAFE

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
BOTH AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME.

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THAT'S THE THING.

257
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
LIKE HOME IS SORT OF LIKE THIS

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
PEACEFUL PLACE --

259
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MICHAEL: A SAFE HAVEN.
KELLY: IT'S A SAFE HAVEN.

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
AND SCHOOL IS THAT OTHER PLACE,

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THEY GET BACK

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
INTO THIS ROUTINE, GO BACK TO

263
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SCHOOL, THEY ARE SAFE THERE.

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
LET THEM ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
AS POSSIBLE AND DON'T BOMBARD

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THEM WITH THE NEWS.

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
AT A CERTAIN POINT, THESE IMAGES

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
CAN BE TOO MUCH.

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
CERTAINLY FOR ME AND I'M SURE

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
FOR THE CHILDREN AS WELL.

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
AND AGAIN, IT CANNOT BE SAID

272
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ENOUGH, AND WE TALK ABOUT IT

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HERE ALL THE TIME.

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THOSE TEACHERS THAT ARE, YOU

275
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
KNOW SUCH HEROES, AND REALLY DID

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THEIR BEST TO SOOTHE, COMFORT,

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000

278
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
MICHAEL: AND IN AN UNTHINKABLE

280
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SITUATION.

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BUT OUR THOUGHTS, OUR PRAYERS

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ARE WITH EVERYONE.

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
NEWTOWN.
I THINK IT'S AFFECTED EVERYBODY.

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SO OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS AND

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
KELLY: I KNOW, THAT'S THE THING.

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000

YOU WOKE UP THIS I

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MICHAEL: YEAH.

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
KELLY: I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

297
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000

LIKE WOW.

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000

HARD THING TO MOVE FORWARD

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000

DISTRACTION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

317
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THIS BY MYSELF, IT WOULD BE TOO

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
DIFFICULT, AND SO WE'RE HERE

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000

320
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY, WE'RE

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IT.

322
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000

DISTRACT.
BE A DIVERSION FROM EVERYTHING

THAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE.

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000

CONCUSSION.

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SHE'S BECOME DEHYDRATED FROM THE

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
BUT, IT REALLY IS THIS VERY

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
INTERESTING FLU BUG THAT I KNOW

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A LOT OF KIDS AT MY KIDS SCHOOL

349
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
HAVE HAD, AND SOME GROWN-UPS

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000

351
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
LOT OF TIMES FAINTING AS A

354
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
RESULT OF IT.

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
SO BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THAT.

356
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING GOOD TO

357
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000

MICHAEL: I WAS GOING TO SAY

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
DEHYDRATED AND DISORIENTED, I

359
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THINK THAT'S HALF OUR STAFF BACK

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT SICK!

AROUND HERE.

363
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
MICHAEL: I HAVE A QUESTION.

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WHAT IS THIS?

365
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000

ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
IT'S ABOUT 24 PAGES, I THINK?

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
WHAT IS THAT?

370
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
