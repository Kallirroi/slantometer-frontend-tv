THERE ARE SIGNS WE ARE HEARING

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
FROM OUR SOURCES THAT THE

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
SOME KIND OF PERSONALITY

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
DISORDER.

138
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
DID HE LEAVE NOTES BEHIND?

139
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
DID HE TELL ANYONE WHAT HE WAS
PLANNING TO DO?

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000

I WAS WATCHING WHEN YOU WERE

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SPEAKING TO WOLF BLITZER AND YOU
BECAME VERY EMOTIONAL.

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TWO OF YOUR CHILDREN WENT TO

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT AND YOU

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WERE NOT SURE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
WITH THEM.

153
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THANKFULLY THEY WERE OKAY.

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
BUT THIS IS EVERY PARENT'S

155
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
NIGHTMARE.

156
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
BODIES OF THESE POOR CHILDREN

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ARE STILL LYING THERE ON

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WHAT THE POLICE ARE CALLING THE

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
CRIME SCENE OF THE SCHOOL.

161
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE PARENTS CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM.

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
IT'S AN UNIMAGINABLE HORROR.

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> Reporter: THERE IS NO OTHER

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WAY TO PUT IT.

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
UNIMAGINABLE HORROR AND AN EVIL

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
VISITED UPON THE COMMUNITY

ANOTHER DETAIL FOR YOU THAT I

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THEIR

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW THE

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
DETAIL THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN

177
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
RACED ON FOOT TO A NEARBY FIRE

181
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000

182
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AREA.

183
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THERE WERE ROBOCALLS THAT WENT

184
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OUT.

185
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WE HEARD THE ROBOCALLS SAYING

186
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000

THROUGHOUT THE DAY THERE WAS ONE

190
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AREA WITHIN THAT FIRE STATION

191
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE KEPT AND

192
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEY WERE SHOWN MOVIES UNTIL

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THEIR PARENTS COULD COME AND

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FIND THEM.

195
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER AREA WHERE A

196
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
NUMBER OF THE PARENTS WERE

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MILLING ABOUT, WAITING FOR

198
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
STUDENTS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE
FIRE STATION.

199
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS A CHAOTIC

200
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SCENE FOR SOMETIME.

201
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SLOWLY BUT SURELY OVER THE

202
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
COURSE OF THE DAY PARENTS
ARRIVED AND CHILDREN WERE TAKEN

203
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
AWAY AND PARENTS CONTINUED TO

204
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WAIT AND OTHER CHILDREN DIDN'T

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ARRIVE AND ULTIMATELY THERE WAS

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A MOMENT WHERE THEY HAD TO TELL

207
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THE WAITING PARENTS THERE WILL

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
BE NO MORE REUNIONS TONIGHT.

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'M TOLD FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
INSIDE THAT AREA IN A ROOM

211
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ADJACENT THAT AT THE MOMENT THE

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PARENTS WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE

213
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
NO MORE CHILDREN COMING THERE

214
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WERE WAILS THAT WERE RELEASED.

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE PERSON WHO TOLD ME THIS SHE

216
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SAID SHE COMPLETELY BROKE DOWN.

217
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THERE WAS A NURSE ON HAND WHO

218
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
VOLUNTEERED HAVING WORKED TWO

219
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
DECADES IN THE BUSINESS.

220
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
HER BROTHER TELLING ME THAT SHE

221
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
JUST WANTED TO BE THERE AND HELP

222
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
IN ANY WAY SHE COULD AS A GRIEF

223
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
COUNSELLOR AND WAS PRESENT AT

224
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THAT TIME AS WELL.

225
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A HORRIFYING MOMENT IF YOU CAN

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
IMAGINE BEING THOSE PARENTS WHO

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
IS WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ONLY TO HEAR THIS AND ULTIMATELY

229
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
LIKE YOU SAID, THEY KNOW THE

230
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
BODIES OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE

231
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
STILL IN THAT SCHOOL TONIGHT.

232
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WORSE IN THE WORLD.

234
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THANK YOU FOR NOW.

235
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I WILL BE JOINED BY THE MAYOR OF

236
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
DANBURY RIGHT NEXT TO NEWTOWN.

237
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

238
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THIS IS ALMOST BEYOND

239
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
DESCRIPTION, BEYOND ANY

240
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
UNDERSTANDING.

241
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
HOW IS THE COMMUNITY DEALING

242
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
WITH THIS OR ARE THEY?

243
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

244
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN A

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HORRIFIC DAY IN THE GREATER

246
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
DANBURY AREA AND PARTICULARLY

247
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN.

248
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OUR HEART GOES OUT TO THE

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST LOVED ONES

250
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN

251
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
AND THE STAFF AND EVERYBODY

252
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ELSE.

253
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY

254
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
DIFFICULT DAY.

255
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE

256
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WERE

258
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
TREMENDOUS AND THE STAFF HAVE

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
BEEN HEROIC IN TERMS OF THEIR

260
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
APPROACH TO THIS.

261
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE INTERNATIONAL

262
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
TRAGEDY AND CRISIS.

263
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNEW

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL WHO

265
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ALSO WAS KILLED.

266
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

267
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING IN

268
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THE SAME SCHOOL SYSTEM AND VERY

269
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DAWN WHO

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
PASSED AWAY TODAY.

271
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SHE WAS A TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL

272
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SYSTEM AND ELEVATED UP THROUGH

273
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THE RANKS AND ENDED UP THE

274
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
PRINCIPAL HERE IN NEWTOWN.

275
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A COMMITTED, HARDWORKING AND

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DEDICATED EDUCATOR.

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
SOMEONE WHO CARED DEEPLY ABOUT

278
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE KIDS AND PUT KIDS FIRST IN

279
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
EVERY FACET AND EVERY WAY IN

280
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WHICH SHE EXECUTED HER JOB AND

281
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SOMEBODY WHO WE ALL ADMIRED

282
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WORKING WITH HER CHILDREN AS A

283
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
PROFESSIONAL.

284
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> EXTREMELY SAD DAY AND I
APPRECIATE YOU JOINING ME.

285
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I CAN ONLY WISH YOU THE VERY

286
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BEST.

287
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
AS YOU'RE TRYING TO REBUILD THE

288
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
COMMUNITY.

289
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
DID YOU KNOW IF THERE PLANS FOR

290
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
MORE VIGILS TOMORROW?

291
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
>> THERE ARE VIGILS SCHEDULED

292
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.

293
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
IN ADDITION TO THAT, CONNECTICUT

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ITSELF IS HAVING A SIMULTANEOUS

295
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
VIGIL THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ORGANIZE RIGHT NOW WHERE EACH

297
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
TOWN AND VILLAGE AND CITY WILL

298
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
TAKE A MOMENT OUT AND SPEND TIME

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
REFLECTING AND MAYBE STARTING

300
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS INITIAL

301
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SHOCK AND REFLECTING A LITTLE

302
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
BIT ABOUT OUR PUBLIC POLICY

303
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
POSITIONS IN TERMS OF THINGS

304
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
LIKE GUN CONTROL AND HOW WE DEAL

305
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WITH FOLKS WHO ARE MENTALLY

306
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
DISABLED.

307
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THIS HORRIFIC
TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED.

308
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I THINK THAT CONVERSATION WILL

309
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
BE STARTED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

310
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

311
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
FOR JOINING ME.

312
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> THANK YOU, PIERS.

313
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> WE CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS

314
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
LIKE IN THE SCHOOL.

315
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
SOFIA WAS THERE AND JUST 8 YEARS

316
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
OLD.

317
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SHE'S A STUDENT AT SANDY HOOK.

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SHE JOINS ME NOW WITH HER

319
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MOTHER, BRENDA.
THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING ME.

320
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IF I MAY START WITH YOU, BRENDA.

321
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THIS IS EVERY MOTHER'S

322
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
NIGHTMARE.

323
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
WHEN WAS THE FIRST YOU HEARD

324
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ABOUT THIS AND HOW DID YOU HEAR?

325
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
>> I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE

326
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM THE

327
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SUPERINTENDENT SAYING THAT THERE

328
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WAS A SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN, BUT

329
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A SCHOOL.

330
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE ON
LOCKDOWN.

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I WASN'T TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE I

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT HAPPENED.

333
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I RECEIVED A TEXT ON MY PHONE

334
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
FROM A NEWS ORGANIZATION AND

335
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THEY SAID THAT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

336
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
HAD A SHOOTING.

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I GOT IN MY CAR AND I WENT OVER

338
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
TO THE SCHOOL AND THERE WERE

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ALREADY STATE POLICE AND THE

340
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
FIRE AND NEWTOWN POLICE.

341
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
>> WHEN YOU GOT THERE, OBVIOUSLY

342
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
SCENES OF COMPLETE CHAOS, HOW

343
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
QUICKLY WAS IT THAT YOU REALIZED

344
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAFE?

345
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> OKAY.

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS

347
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
COMPLETE CHAOS, BUT I DID SEE

348
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
MOMS AND A NEIGHBOR AND ASKED

349
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID

350
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

351
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND I

352
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
SAW A NEIGHBOR LIKE I SAID AND

353
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
HE SAID THEY CARRIED OUT A

354
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
LITTLE GIRL AND SHE

355
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS DEAD.

356
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
INSTANTLY I PANICKED BECAUSE OF

357
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
MY BABY HERE, BUT THANKFULLY NO

358
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SOONER HE SAID THAT I LOOKED

359
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TOWARDS THE KIDS BEING BROUGHT

360
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE FIREHOUSE

361
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AND I SAW HER CLASS AND I RAN UP

362
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
AND I SAID WHERE IS SOFIA AND

363
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
THEY SAID SHE IS OKAY.

364
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SHE'S COMING.

365
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I SAW HER WITH HER TEACHER AND

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WE ALL WERE TAKEN INTO THE

367
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
FIREHOUSE AND KEPT SO THEY COULD

368
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
DO A ROLL CALL AND MAKE SURE ALL

369
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THE STUDENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.

370
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> SOFIA, IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING

371
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
DAY FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

372
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS

373
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
HAPPENING?

374
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WERE YOU AWARE SOMEBODY WAS

375
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
FIRING A GUN IN THE SCHOOL?

376
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
>> CAN YOU HEAR, HONEY?

377
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
>> NOT REALLY.

378
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
>> SHE CAN'T REALLY HEAR.

379
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY HEARD POPS

380
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
IN THE HALLWAY.

381
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
THE TEACHER TOLD ME ALSO,

382
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
COURTNEY MARTIN IS MY HERO, SHE

383
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
LOCKED THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AND

384
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
BROUGHT ALL THE KIDS TO A CORNER

385
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY STAYED

386
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THERE.

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THEY WERE SCARED AND SHAKEN, BUT

388
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

389
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
ON UNTIL LATER WHEN THEY WERE

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
BROUGHT INTO THE FIREHOUSE.

391
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
POLICE CAME AND KNOCKED ON THE

392
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
DOOR AND SAID IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN

393
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
COME OUT.

394
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THEY GUIDED THEM TO THE BACK OF
THE SCHOOL AND THEY WALKED OVER

395
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TO THE FIREHOUSE.

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THAT'S WHERE I CAUGHT UP WITH
SOFIA.

397
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> HOW IS SOPHIA NOW?

398
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRAUMATIC

399
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EXPERIENCE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN

400
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WHO SURVIVED THIS.

401
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
>> I THINK SHE IS NUMB RIGHT

402
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
NOW.

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
SHE IS A PRETTY BRIGHT KID AND

404
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
SHE HAS A BIG SUPPORT STAFF AT

405
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
HOME AND WE LOVE HER VERY MUCH

406
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
AND SHE WILL BE FINE.

407
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WE ARE DEVASTATED FOR THE REST
OF THE FAMILIES.

408
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WAS HURT.

409
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I DO KNOW MY CLOSE FRIENDS'S

410
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
CHILDREN ARE OKAY, BUT WE DON'T

411
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
KNOW WHO THE CHILDREN WERE.

412
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN HEAR

413
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
ME OR NOT, BUT I WONDERED IF SHE

414
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

415
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER TODAY.

416
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,

417
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
HONEY?

418
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
ARE YOU SURE?

419
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I THINK SHE'S TOO COLD NOW.

420
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
>> SHE SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME
WITH HER MOM.

421
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING DAY FOR

422
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

423
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU WERE

424
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
ABLE TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.

425
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OBVIOUSLY YOUR HEART MUST GO OUT

426
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
TO THE POOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE

427
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEIR POOR

428
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.

429
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
>> IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY AND

430
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
IT'S A CLOSE-KNIT SCHOOL AND

431
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
DEVASTATING.

432
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I WILL BE HERE FOR ANYBODY AND

433
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO ALL THE

434
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
FAMILIES.

435
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

436
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> I'M JUST THE LUCKIEST LADY

437
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
RIGHT NOW.

438
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
THANK YOU.

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
FOR JOINING ME.
I APPRECIATE IT.

441
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
>> THANK YOU.

442
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

443
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> VERY LUCKY INDEED.

444
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE GUNMAN IS ADAM LANZA AND

445
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
JOINING ME IS LANZA'S FORMER

446
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
CLASSMATE, ALEX ISRAEL.

447
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

448
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
YOU KNEW THIS CHARACTER.

449
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE

450
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
PREDICTED HE WOULD ONE DAY FLIP

451
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
AND DO SOMETHING AS MONSTEROUS

452
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
AS THIS?

453
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER

454
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
PREDICT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

455
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WOULD HAPPEN.

456
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GOING TO

457
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
HAPPEN TO YOUR SCHOOL AND WHERE

458
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
YOU LIVED YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

459
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HAVE
PREDICTED IT.

460
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT

461
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
HIM.

462
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I KNEW HIM CLOSELY WHEN WE WERE

463
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
VERY YOUNG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

464
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
TOGETHER.

465
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

466
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
DIFFERENT.

467
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HE MOSTLY STUCK TO HIMSELF.

468
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY YOU

469
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS.

470
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> HE WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A

471
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
PRETTY CLEVER YOUNG MAN, ALMOST

472
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A GENIUS IN MATH.

473
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
TELL ME ABOUT THAT SIDE OF HIM.

474
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
>> I WAS NEVER IN ANY OF HIS

475
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
CLASSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

476
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
BUT YEAH, YOU COULD DEFINITELY

477
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
TELL HE WAS I WOULD SAY A

478
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
GENIUS.

479
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

480
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
THERE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT

481
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ABOVE THE REST OF US.

482
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> DID HE HAVE FRIENDS?

483
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WAS HE SOCIABLE?

484
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> I ALWAYS SAW HIM ALONE WHEN

485
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE

486
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
SCHOOL OR SITTING AT THE TABLE,

487
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
SITTING ON THE BUS.

488
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW MAYBE

489
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
CLOSE FRIENDS THROUGH SCHOOL OR

490
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THROUGH HIS CLASSES.

491
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
MOST OF THE TIME I SAW HIM, HE

492
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WAS ALONE.

493
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS

494
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
PERSONALITY?

495
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET.

496
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

497
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
HE WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY.

498
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
A LITTLE UNEASY SOMETIMES IF YOU
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

499
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

500
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
REALLY INTO GOING OUT THERE AND

501
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
MAKING AS MANY FRIENDS AS

502
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
EVERYONE WAS DOING IN ELEMENTARY

503
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.

504
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
HE PREFERRED TO STAY TO HIMSELF.

505
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
>> DID YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY, HIS

506
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
MOTHER IN PARTICULAR?

507
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
>> I KNEW HER BECAUSE WE LIVED
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

508
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I KNEW HER THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD

509
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
EVENTS.

510
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
MY MOM KNEW HER.

511
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
SHE WAS A VERY NICE WOMAN.

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

513
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OBVIOUSLY.
I DIDN'T KNOW HER PERSONALLY,

514
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
BUT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, SHE

515
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WAS A NICE WOMAN.

516
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> HIS PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

517
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT HAVING A

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
BIG IMPACT ON HIM?

519
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY GOT

520
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
DIVORCED.

521
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE ABOUT

522
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
FIRST GRADE AND HE HAS ALWAYS

523
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
BEEN THE WAY I DESCRIBED HIM.

524
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN RESERVED,

525
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
QUIET.

526
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DIVORCE

527
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT OR

528
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
WHEN THEY DIVORCED.

529
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT OR

530
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
MADE IT WORSE AS HE GOT OLDER

531
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
AND BECAME A LITTLE BIT MORE

532
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
RESERVED.
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT AFFECTED

533
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
IT.

534
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

535
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS

536
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION WHEN YOU

537
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
DISCOVERED IT WAS THIS PERSON

538
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU KNEW?

539
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
>> IT WAS DEVASTATING.

540
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'M IN LONDON NOW STUDYING HERE

541
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
FOR THE SEMESTER AND COMING HOME

542
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ON THURSDAY TO THIS.

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I FOUND OUT FIRST EARLY THIS

544
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
MORNING I GUESS PROBABLY WHEN IT
BROKE AT HOME.

545
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
IT WAS AROUND 2:00 AND THE FIRST

546
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
INFORMATION OF IT, IT'S

547
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DEFENSE TATE -- DEVASTATING TO

548
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD

549
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
HAPPEN IN A TOWN WHERE YOU

550
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
LIVED.

551
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I FELT SAFE MY WHOLE LIFE AND I

552
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
WAS RAISED IN THAT ELEMENTARY

553
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

554
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THERE AND FINDING OUT IT WAS

555
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SOMEONE I KNEW WHO HAD DONE ALL

556
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
OF THIS IS JUST UPSETTING.

557
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOULD
EVER HAPPEN.

558
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> THE COMMUNITY AROUND NEWTOWN,

559
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT?

560
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'M HEARING IT WAS A VERY --

561
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IT'S A KIND OF QUIET PLACE AND

562
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THIS STUFF NEVER HAPPENS.

563
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THEY DON'T GET MANY SHOOTINGS

564
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
AND GUN MURDERS.

565
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL KIND OF

566
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
PLACE IN THAT SENSE.

567
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> NO.

568
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I MEAN IT'S A PRETTY BIG TOWN

569
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
SPACE-WISE.

570
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
WE SPAN OVER A PRETTY VAST ARRAY

571
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
OF LAND, BUT IT'S REALLY

572
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
CLOSE-KNIT IN THAT EVERYONE

573
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
KNOWS EACH OTHER AND IS CLOSE

574
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WITH EACH OTHER AND THE SCHOOL

575
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SYSTEMS ARE CLOSE.

576
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
YOU GROW UP WITH THESE PEOPLE

577
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
AND GO TO SCHOOL WITH THEM.

578
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
EVERYONE CAME TOGETHER I THINK

579
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THROUGH THIS.

580
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
THEY ARE REALLY SUPPORTING EACH

581
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OTHER QUITE WELL.

582
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THAT'S ONE GOOD THING TO COME

583
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
OUT OF IT IF ANYTHING.

584
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU

585
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
SPOKE TO ADAM LANZA?

586
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
>> PROBABLY MIDDLE SCHOOL.

587
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONNECTION

588
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
WITH HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

589
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL PROBABLY.

590
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THE LAST TIME I SAID A WORD TO
HIM.

591
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
>> YOUR SUMMARY IS KIND OF

592
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
FIDGETY AND SLIGHTLY A LONER AND

593
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
NOT MASSIVELY SOCIABLE, BUT NOT

594
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
APPARENTLY DANGEROUS.

595
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
>> NO, I MEAN I NEVER NOTICED

596
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
ANYTHING SCARY OR VIOLENT OR

597
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

598
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED THAT

599
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
FROM HIM, I DON'T THINK.

600
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
JUST FOR SOMEONE WHO SORT OF

601
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WENT UNDER THE RADAR AND KEPT TO

602
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THEMSELVES, YOU WOULDN'T REALLY

603
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THINK OF THEM AS DOING SOMETHING

604
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
CRAZY LIKE THIS.

605
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>> IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HECK OF A

606
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
SHOCK TO YOU AND I AM GRATEFUL

607
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FOR YOU JOINING US TO GIVE US

608
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHARACTER OF
THIS PERSON.

609
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I APPRECIATE YOU JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.

610
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
>> THANK YOU.

611

>>> COMING UP NEXT, THE

612
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SHOOTER, ADAM

613

LANZA.
TWO EXPERTS ARE HERE TO TALK

614
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
ABOUT THE GUNMAN.

615
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
>>> EARLIER TODAY, A NUMBER OF

616
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
OUR CITIZENS, BEAUTIFUL

617
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
CHILDREN, HAD THEIR LIFE TAKEN

618
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
AWAY FROM THEM.

619
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
AS WELL AS ADULTS WHOSE

620
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO EDUCATE

621
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
AND SUPERVISE THOSE CHILDREN.

622
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME IS

623
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
DEAD.

624
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
AS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO THE

625
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
PERPETRATOR LIVED WITH.

626
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
>> THE CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR

627
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY.

628
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION ON THE

629
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA.

630
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
HE WAS WEARING A BULLET PROOF

631
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
VEST.
WHAT COULD HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO DO

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WITH THIS?

633
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

634
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
LET ME START WITH YOU, DR.

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
AMADORE.

636
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY OF

637
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS AND
POSSIBLY NOTHING AS APPALLING AS

638
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THIS.

639
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN WITH

640
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
AURORA AND THE SHOPPING MALL

641
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SHOOTING LAST WEEK.

642
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
YOUNG MEN IN THEIR EARLY 20s

643
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
SUDDENLY FLIPPING AND GETTING

644
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AHOLD OF WEAPONS AND CAUSING

645
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
OUTRAGES.

646
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WHAT IS DRIVING THEM?

647
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE BACKGROUND

648
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

649
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE

650
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
CASES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

651
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
DIFFERENT CAUSES THAT CAN BE

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD

653
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
CATEGORIES.

654
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ONE CATEGORY IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

655
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THAT TRAIT OF A LOSS OF EMPATHY

656
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
AND INABILITY TO CONNECT TO

657
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
OTHER PEOPLE AND A HISTORY OF

658
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
CRUELTY OR WHAT PEOPLE TALK

659
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
ABOUT AS SOCIOPATHS OR

660
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY.

661
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AT THE OTHER END PEOPLE WITH

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
BRAIN DISORDERS AND SERIOUS

663
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE

664
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
UNTREATED OR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

665
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
HAPPENING IN THEIR LIFE,

666
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
EXACERBATED BY STRESS.

667
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LITTLE BIT

668
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THAT IS COMING OUT, WE ARE MORE

669
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
IN A DIRECTION THAT THIS IS

670
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN DISORDER

671
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STORY

672
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO

673
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
UNCOVER WHAT TRIGGERED THIS.

674
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THERE IS NOTHING SUDDEN ABOUT

675
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ANY OF THESE STORIES.

676
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THAT'S THE HEADLINE FOR ME.

677
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
IT'S SUDDEN FOR US THAT THIS

678
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
HAPPENED.

679
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
AS YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE

680
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
STORY, I ASSURE YOU THE WARNING

681
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
SIGNS WERE THERE.

682
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
NOT THAT THEY WERE IGNORED, BUT

683
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THEY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED.

684
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS AS

685
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
LIKELY TO CARRY OUT WHAT THEY

686
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
END UP DOING IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

687
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS?

688
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
>> LOOK, THERE IS NO QUESTION

689
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THAT FIREARMS PLAY A ROLE.

690
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE

691
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO KILL A

692
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE, THERE OTHER

693
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION AND WAYS

694
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
TO MAKE BOMBS AND AT LEAST ONE

695
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CASE I WORKED ON.

696
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
FIREARMS ARE CERTAINLY AN

697
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE,

698
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
BUT UNDERSTANDING WHEN SOMEBODY

699
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS IF IT

700
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
HAS PLAYED A ROLE HERE, AND I'M

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
NOT SAYING I KNOW THAT IT HAS,

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

703
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BEFORE
ALLOWING THAT PERSON TO HAVE A

704
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
FIREARM.

705
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
>> FRANK, YOU SPECIALIZE IN

706
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
TREATING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

707
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
AND THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE.

708
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
A VERY PARTICULAR PROBLEM HERE

709
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
WITH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE

710
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SCHOOL WHO HAVE LUCKILY

711
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SURVIVED.

712
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
HAVING TO DEAL NOW WITH TH

713
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
HORROR OF LOSING POSSIBLE

714
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
FRIENDS AND PEOPLE THAT THEY

715
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
KNEW FROM THE SCHOOL AND

716
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
TEACHERS AND THE HEAD TEACHER

717
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND SO ON.

718
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WHERE DO YOU START WITH TRYING

719
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
TO COUNSEL YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN

720
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THIS KIND OF APPALLING THING

721
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
HAPPENS?

722
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> I THINK THE FIRST THING IS

723
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
HELPING THE PARENTS.

724
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THE CHILDREN LOOK TO THEIR

725
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PARENTS AND FOR THE PARENTS,

726
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
SOME OF THEM ARE STUNNED.

727
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THEY ARE GRIEVING.

728
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THEY LOST A PRECIOUS 6-YEAR-OLD.

729
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
FOR THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES,

730
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
SOMETIMES CHILDREN WHO GO

731
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THROUGH THIS AND DO SURVIVE TAKE

732
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
A WHILE TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF IT.

733
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THEY MAY REGRESS AND MOVE

734
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
BACKWARDS A YEAR OR TWO IN TERMS

735
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OF THEIR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT.

736
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
SOME OF THEM WILL FIGURE OUT

737
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
YEARS LATER WHAT ACTUALLY

738
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
HAPPENED.

739
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SOME ARE GOING TO DO RELATIVELY
WELL.

740
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
THEY WILL BE SADDER AND WISER IN

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
A WAY.

742
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT

743
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I SEE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

744
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THAT COMMUNITY IS COMING

745
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
TOGETHER.

746
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
PEOPLE ARE LOVING EACH OTHER.

747
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS COME TO REMIND

748
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
US THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO

749
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
CARES AND HE CAME AS A FATHER.

750
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I AM A FATHER AND A GRANDFATHER.

751
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I HAVE CALLED MY CHILDREN AND I

752
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING

753
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

754
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
AS WE COME TOGETHER, WE DO THE

755
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
BEST THAT WE CAN AT A SAD TIME

756
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
LIKE THIS.

757
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
>> I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS

758
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
WHY WOULD THIS SHOOTER DO WHAT

759
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
HE DID?

760
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
GO TO A CLASSROOM AND MURDER SO

761
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
MANY YOUNG CHILDREN OF SUCH A

762
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
YOUNG TENDER AGE, POSSIBLY THE

763
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
CLASSROOM THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

764
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
ALREADY KILLED AT THEIR HOME.

765
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
CAN YOU TRY TO PIECE FROM YOUR

766
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
EXPERIENCE THE THOUGHT PROCESS

767
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
HERE?

768
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WHY HE WOULD THEN HAVING KILLED

769
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
HIS MOTHER GO TO THE SCHOOL AND

770
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
DO WHAT HE DID?

771
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL

772
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
AND I HAVEN'T DIAGNOSED OR

773
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
ASSESSED HIM.

774
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

775
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE

776
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
NOT MORE VIOLENT.

777
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT

778
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
THAT.
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

779
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
SIMPLY NOT THE DATA WE HAVE.

780
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
IF INDEED MENTAL ILLNESS IS A

781
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
PART OF THIS, THERE IS A

782
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
PARTICULAR PATH THAT NEEDS TO BE
LOOKED AT.

783
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
IS THIS SOMEBODY WHO BECAME

784
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED.

785
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
AND WITH HIS AUTISM,

786
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
HIS ROOMMATE ALEX ISRAEL SAID HE

787
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
PREFERRED TO STAY ALONE.

788
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
A SYMPTOM OF ASPERGER'S AND

789
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THIS IS ONE REPORT COMING OUT,

790
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE, IS

791
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
SOMETHING IS MISSING IN THE

792
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
BRAIN, THE CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY

793
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AND SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT

794
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
LEAVES THE PERSON SUFFERING FROM

795
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THIS CONDITION.

796
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
THEY ARE PRONE TO SERIOUS

797
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

798
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
IF THEY ARE SUICIDALLY

799
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
DEPRESSED, WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

800
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IN

801
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
AGREEING TO COME HERE IS TO ASK

802
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
PEOPLE TO DON'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT

803
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
ABOUT WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS.

804
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
INFORMATION.

805
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
IF IT WAS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

806
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
PLAYED A ROLE, IT'S AN

807
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO BETTER.

808
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> THERE IS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

809
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM ANY

810
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
ATTENTION AND NAME HIM AND SO ON

811
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
BECAUSE IT BRINGS ATTENTION TO

812
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
HIM.

813
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
MY VIEW IS THAT HE'S DEAD AND

814
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
WOMAN BE ABLE TO BASQUE IN THE

815
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
GLORY OF WHAT HE DID.

816
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>> YOU'RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION

817
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
THAT HE WANTS TO BASS INCOME THE

818
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
GLORY OF WHAT WE DID.

819
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

820
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I SPEND MANY HOURS WITH MEN LIKE

821
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THIS WHO KILLED DOZENS OF

822
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
PEOPLE.
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT

823
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
GLORY.

824
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY ILL.

825
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
OTHERS WHO DO WANT GLORY.

826
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
YOU ARE RUSHING TO A PARTICULAR

827
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
INTERPRETATION OF THIS.

828
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
IT'S WAY TOO SOON TO KNOW.

829
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
>> AND PIERS --

830
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
>> SORRY.

831
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
FRANK, GO AHEAD.

832
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ENDORSE THAT

833
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ALSO.

834
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I KNOW FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY, WE

835
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS

836
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
HAPPENED.

837
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
WHEN YOU ARE A PARENT YOU CAN'T

838
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE

839
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ASKING.

840
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

841
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ANSWERING THEM.

842
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAD

843
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES RECENTLY,

844
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
YES, THESE WERE SIMILAR IN THAT

845
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
GUNS WERE USED AND THEY WERE

846
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
SPREE KILLINGS AND MASS

847
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
KILLINGS.

848
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEDICAL

849
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
DOCTOR AND PSYCHIATRIST WHO

850
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE FBI ON

851
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
CASES, THERE ARE DRAMATICALLY

852
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
DIFFERENT MOTIVES AND

853
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
MENTALITIES.

854
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

855
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A CONSCIENCE.

856
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
THEY TORTURE ANIMALS.

857
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN THEIR MIND

858
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
FOR EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY.

859
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
THEY LEARN HOW TO FAKE IT.

860
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS FIT

861
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
THAT PATTERN, BUT THE OTHER WAS

862
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

863
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
HE WAS NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

864
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
IN THE CASE OF THE AURORA

865
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
SHOOTER, THE JURY IS NOT IN YET,

866
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL

867
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
FIND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

868
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT
DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS.

869
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ONE TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS

870
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

871
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
PROGRAM OF MENTAL HEALTH
SERVICES IN AMERICA.

872
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I HAVE TO ADMIT WE FAILED.

873
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
WE FAILED AMERICA IN PROTECTING

874
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THE LIVES OF THE SERIOUSLY

875
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
MENTALLY ILL.

876
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
MOST OF WHAT THEY DO IS SUFFER

877
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
IN SILENCE.

878
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEIR FAMILIES WANT TO DO BETTER

879
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
BY THEM AND AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE

880
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
NOT STEPPED UP AND BEEN

881
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
SYMPATHETIC AND CARING AND

882
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERIOUSLY

883
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
MENTALLY ILL.

884
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
>> AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT.

885
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS YOU

886
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BOTH HAVE MADE EXTREMELY VALID
POINTS.

887
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
MY POINT REALLY IS THAT

888
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
YOU HAVE THREE SUCCESSIVE

889
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
APPALLING MASS SHOOTINGS

890
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
INVOLVING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s

891
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
WHERE THE BACKGROUND TO ALL OF

892
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
THEM WAS NOT DISSIMILAR.

893
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THEY SEEM TO BE FAIRLY NORMAL

894
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
KIND OF SLIGHTLY OFF, BUT

895
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
NOTHING WITH ALARM BELLS.

896
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THE POINT OF EXAMINING THEIR

897
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
CHARACTER IS THAT THERE MUST BE

898
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE

899
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
ARE OTHERS LIKE HG THEM OUT

900
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THERE WHO MAY BE CONSIDERING

901
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
SIMILAR ATROCITIES.

902
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HOW DO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THESE
TYPES OF PEOPLE SPOT ANY WARNING

903
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SIGNS?

904
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
>> PIERS --

905
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
>> LET ME START WITH THE DOCTOR.

906
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> I'M SORRY.

907
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN.

908
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
BEFORE THIS INTERVIEW THEY ASKED

909
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
ME WHAT I WAS DOING AND WE

910
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT AN

911
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
HOUR AND A HALF.

912
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
MY 9-YEAR-OLD GOT FRIGHTENED, HE

913
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
GOES TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

914
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THESE

915
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THINGS ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

916
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS

917
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

918
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED

919
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
IN THE LAST MONTH DOESN'T

920
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
STATISTICALLY MAKE IT A COMMON

921
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
OCCURRENCE.

922
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
LET'S BE CLEAR AND TELL OUR

923
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
CHILDREN THAT.

924
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THE OTHER THING IS THAT

925
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN

926
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
TRAGEDY INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO

927
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FIX SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

928
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
TERRIBLY BROKEN IN OUR MENTAL

929
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

930
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WE DO KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY

931
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
PEOPLE AT RISK FOR VIOLENCE.

932
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
IT'S ALL AT THE LEVEL OF STATE

933
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
FUNDING.

934
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SORRY ABOUT GET INTO THE

935
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SPECIFICS, BUT IT'S MENTAL

936
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
HEALTH CARE AND SCREENING OF NOT

937
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ONLY YOUNG ADULTS AND CHILDREN

938
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
WHO OFFER A GOOD ASSESSMENT, WE

939
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CAN IN FACT DO A MUCH BETTER JOB

940
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
OF NOT ONLY CARING FOR THE

941
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY THOSE WHO

942
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WOULD NEVER BE VIOLENT IF NOT

943
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
FOR A MENTAL ILLNESS.

944
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THAT IS ONE BIT OF THE STORY.

945
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
THERE IS ANOTHER PART WHICH IS

946
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
WHAT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE

947
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH AND

948
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE OF MOVIES.

949
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THE DIABOLICAL SOCIOPATH.

950
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
BOTH STORIES ARE TRUE, BUT BOTH

951
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE RARE.

952
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
>> THE FINAL WORD, MAKE IT BRIEF

953
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
IF YOU MAY.

954
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
>> AMERICA HAS MORE GUN DEATHS

955
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION

956
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
IN THE WORLD.

957
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
WE HAVE LAWS THAT SAY IF YOU ARE

958
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL, YOU

959
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SHOULDN'T POSSESS A WEAPON AND

960
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
WE DON'T ENFORCE THE LAWS.

961
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER ACROSS

962
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
THIS DIVIDE AND NEED THE NRA TO

963
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
STEP UP AND SAY THEY BELIEVE IN

964
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
GUN SAFETY AND NOT JUST IN GUN

965
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
OWNERSHIP.

966
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
WE NEED POLITICIANS ON BOTH

967
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO TACKLE

968
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THIS PROBLEM.

969
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE DEAD

970
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
AMERICAN CHILDREN.

971
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
>> THANKOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

972
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
STILL AHEAD, WE WILL TALK TO

973
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
SURVIVORS OF ANOTHER SHOOTING,

974
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
BUT NEXT THE PUSH FOR MORE GUN

975
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
CONTROL AFTER THE TRAGEDY.

976
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE'LL DEBATE IT.
ñ?

977
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>>> THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR
NEIGHBORHOODS.

978
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

979
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMING

980
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
TO AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

981
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

982
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

983
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE

984
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SHOOTING.

985
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THE MASSACRE IS RAISING NEW

986
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCESS OF
GUNS IN AMERICA.

987
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
JOINING ME NOW IS MY PANEL.

988
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
LET'S START WITH YOU.

989
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
YOU WERE PRETTY OUTSPOKEN SAYING

990
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THIS IS TIME TO BRING IN NEW GUN

991
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
CONTROL LAWS.

992
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
>> YES.

993
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
IF THIS DOESN'T WAKE US UP, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

994
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I WAS HEARTENED THAT THE

995
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
PRESIDENT SAID WE HAD TO TAKE

996
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION AND THE ONLY

997
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THING HE CAN DO IS LEAD A

998
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
CRUSADE FOR REASONABLE GUN

999
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
CONTROL LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS.

1000
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THESE MASSACRES ARE TAKING PLACE

1001
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
MORE AND MORE OFTEN.

1002
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WE SAW BAY THE WAY TODAY A

1003
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
SIMILAR INCIDENT IN CHINA WHERE

1004
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
A MAD MAN ATTACKED AN ELEMENTARY

1005
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
SCHOOL IN CHINA WITH A KNIFE

1006
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WITH 22 INJURED CHILDREN.

1007
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
INJURED, NOT DEAD.

1008
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

1009
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE

1010
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
9,000 PEOPLE KILLED WITH GUNS

1011
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
LAST YEAR IN SIMILAR COUNTRIES

1012
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
LIKE GERMANY, 170 AND CANADA

1013
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
150.

1014
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.

1015
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN

1016
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
TERMS OF SPECIFIC GUN CONTROL?

1017
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
>> THERE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF

1018
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
LEGISLATION WE HAVE BEEN

1019
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
PUSHING.

1020
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
NO REASONABLE GUNOWNER WHO IS A

1021
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
SPORTSMAN CAN OBJECT TO BANS ON

1022
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS MADE ONLY TO

1023
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
KILL AS MANY HUMAN BEINGS AS

1024
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
POSSIBLE LIKE IN A MILITARY

1025
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
SITUATION.

1026
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO A BAN ON

1027
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THE SALE OF LARGE AMMUNITION

1028
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
CLIPS SO YOU CAN'T RELOAD.

1029
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO

1030
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
MICROSTAMPING OF CAR TRAJ --

1031
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
CARTRIDGES SO YOU CAN TRACE THE

1032
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
MURD E WE POP.

1033
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO ELIMINATING
THE GUNSHOT EXCEPTION SO EVEN IF

1034
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
YOU BUY A GUN AT A GUN SHOW,
THEY STILL HAVE TO CHECK YOUR

1035
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
BACKGROUND TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

1036
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
NOT SELLING TO SOMEONE ON A

1037
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
TERRORIST WATCH LIST OR MENTALLY

1038
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
UNSTABLE PERSON OR A FELON.

1039
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
THOSE ARE THE REASONABLE THINGS

1040
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WE SHOULD DO.

1041
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
>> WE HAD A HEATED DEBATE ON A

1042
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
PREVIOUS INCIDENT.

1043
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TWO THINGS HAPPENED IN 1996.

1044
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
THERE WAS A MASSACRE IN TASMANIA

1045
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
IN WHICH 35 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

1046
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THE AUSTRALIANS, LED BY THE

1047
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
PRIME MINISTER, HE BROUGHT IN

1048
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
DRACONIAN LAWS AFTER THAT.

1049
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
HE BANNED SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES

1050
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
AND SHOT GUNS.

1051
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
AS A RESULT OF THE NEXT DECADE,

1052
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
FIREARM HOMICIDE RATE FELL BY

1053
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
59% AND SUICIDE RATE FELL BY

1054
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
65%.
>> NOT TRUE.

1055
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

1056
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1057
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
IF YOU LOOK OVER TIME --

1058
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

1059
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
>> I'M TELLING YOU PEOPLE CAN

1060
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
LOOK UP THE STATISTICS
THEMSELVES.

1061
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
WHAT YOU FIND IS FOR DECADES THE

1062
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MURDER RATE WAS FALLING IN

1063
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AUSTRALIA.

1064
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
IT BASICALLY STOPPED FALLING.

1065
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
IF YOU JUST COMPARE THE AVERAGE

1066
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
OVER TWO DECADES WHERE IT'S

1067
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
FALLING TO WHAT IT WAS

1068
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AFTERWARDS, IT MAKES

1069
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
IT LOOK LIKE THE AVERAGE BEFORE

1070
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IS HIGHER THAN AFTERWARDS.

1071
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
IF YOU LOOK ON A YEAR BY YEAR

1072
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
BASIS, THERE WASN'T THAT FALL.

1073
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
>> WHY DOES ADAM LANZA'S MOTHER

1074
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
NEED TO HAVE THESE THREE

1075
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
WEAPONS?

1076
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
>> CAN I FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE

1077
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AUSTRALIAN THING?

1078
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
>> NO, WHY DOES SHE NEED TO HAVE

1079
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THESE THREE WEAPONS, LEGALLY

1080
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
PURCHASED, INCLUDING THIS SEMI

1081
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
AUTOMATIC BUSHMASTER?

1082
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
WHY WOULD A WOMAN TEACHER AT A

1083
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
KINDERGARTEN NEED THESE WEAPONS

1084
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
IN HER HOME, ALLOWING A CLEARLY

1085
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
DERANGED SON TO TAKE THEM AND

1086
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
COMMIT THIS ATROCITY?
>> WHATEVER THAT GUN LOOKS LIKE,

1087
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IT'S A SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE.
ANY HUNTING RIFLE IS SEMI

1088
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AUTOMATIC.

1089
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
JUST BECAUSE IT LOOKS DIFFERENT

1090
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
ON THE OUTSIDE DOESN'T MEAN IT

1091
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY.

1092
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS IN

1093
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THIS

1094
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
APPARENTLY HARMLESS RIFLE.

1095
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
>> NOBODY SAID GUNS ARE
HARMLESS.

1096
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
>> YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY IT'S AN

1097
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
AVERAGE GUN.

1098
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS AND

1099
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
KILLED 20 CHILDREN.

1100
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
20 CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 10.

1101
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
WHAT POINT DO YOU GUN LOBBY GUYS

1102
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
SAY WE GET IT?
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE?

1103
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
>> IT IS TIME.

1104
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
>> TIME TO DO WHAT?

1105
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
>> TO GET RID OF THE GUN LAWS

1106
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THAT CAUSE --

1107
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
>> WHICH ONES?

1108
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
>> LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.

1109
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
ALL THESE ATTACKS THIS YEAR

1110
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
OCCURRED WHERE GUNS ARE BANNED.

1111
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
LOOK AT THE AURORA SHOOTING.

1112
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THERE WAS SEVEN MOVIE --

1113
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
>> WHAT THE HELL HAS THAT GOT TO

1114
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
DO WITH IT?
SERIOUSLY.

1115
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT?

1116
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
>> YOU NEVER LET ME EXPLAIN.

1117
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

1118
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
>> IS IT A GUN-FREE ZONE.

1119
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
>> LOOK AT THE MOVIE THEATER

1120
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
ONE.

1121
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THERE WERE SEVEN MOVIE THEATERS

1122
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SHOWING THE BATMAN MOVIE WITHIN

1123
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
A 20-MINUTE DRIVE OF WHERE THE

1124
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
KILLER LIVED.

1125
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
ONLY ONE OF THOSE BANNED GUNS.

1126
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE THEATER

1127
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
CLOSEST TO HIS HOME.

1128
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
HE WENT TO THE ONE THEATER THAT
BANNED GUNS.

1129
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
IF YOU LOOK AT BANS GENERALLY,

1130
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
YOU CAN'T POINT TO A PLACE,

1131
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
CHICAGO, D.C. WHERE WE BAN GUNS

1132
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
AND MURDER RATES AND VIOLENT
CRIMES WENT UP.

1133
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
IN THE UK IN JAMAICA AND

1134
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
IRELAND, ISLAND NATIONS THAT

1135
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
BANNED GUNS, YOU CAN'T FIND A

1136
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
PLACE WHERE MURDER RATES HAVE

1137
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
GONE DOWN.

1138
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THEY HAVE GONE UP USUALLY BY

1139
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
LARGE AMOUNTS.

1140
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
>> YOU CANNOT FIND A PLACE --

1141
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, BASICALLY EVERY

1142
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
STATISTIC THAT JOHN CITED IS

1143
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
PURE BUNK IN TERMS OF THE FACT

1144
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
THAT THE MORE GUNS EQUAL --

1145
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THAT'S TRUE.

1146
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
THEY WERE GUN-FREE ZONES, BUT

1147
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ATTRIBUTING THAT TO THE FACT

1148
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THAT THIS VIOLENCE OCCURRED,

1149
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO STEP IN.

1150
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
LISTEN, MY BROTHER WAS SHOT IN A

1151
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
SHOOTING ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE

1152
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
STATE BUILDING WHICH WAS

1153
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
CHAOTIC.

1154
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I KNOW FIRSTHAND I TALKED WITH

1155
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THE VICTIMS FROM THE AURORA

1156
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
TRAGEDY.

1157
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AND ALL THESE TRAGEDIES.
TO A PERSON, THEY ALL SAY IF

1158
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
THERE WERE ANOTHER PERSON ARMED,

1159
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IT WOULD HAVE LED TO MORE

1160
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
CARNAGE.

1161
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> THEY'VE STOPPED MANY CASES.

1162
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
>> EXCUSE ME.

1163
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
>> NAME ONE CASE WHERE THAT'S

1164
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
HAPPENED.

1165
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
IF EVERY ONE OF THE CASES THEY

1166
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
SAY IF THERE WERE MORE GUNS, IT
WOULD HAVE ONLY LED TO MORE

1167
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
CHAOS.

1168
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
LOOK AT THE EMPIRE BUILDING

1169
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
SHOOTING HERE IN NEW YORK.

1170
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
THERE WERE HIGHLY TRAINED

1171
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OFFICERS IN THE CHAOS AND EIGHT

1172
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
OTHER PEOPLE SHOT AND EVERY ONE

1173
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
WAS AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN AND

1174
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
EVERY ONE WAS SHOT BY A LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

1175
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
>> WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY FOR THE

1176
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

1177
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

1178
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

1179
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1180
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> I BELIEVE THOSE OF US WHO ARE

1181
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
LICENSED TO CARRY ARE

1182
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AND SHOULDN'T

1183
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
BE PROHIBITED FROM CARRYING IN

1184
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
SCHOOLS OR OTHER PLACES.

1185
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
IN FACT, THE MICHIGAN

1186
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL LAST

1187
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
NIGHT AND SENT TO THE GOVERNOR

1188
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
FOR SIGNATURE A BILL THAT WOULD

1189
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
ALLOW THOSE OF US WHO ARE

1190
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
LICENSED TO TAKE MORE DAY OF

1191
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
TRAINING INCLUDING RANGE TIME

1192
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
AND BE ABLE TO CARRY IN THE

1193
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
PLACES WHERE WE COULDN'T CARRY
BEFORE.

1194
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
>> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT

1195
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS AFTER WHAT

1196
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
HAPPENED TODAY?

1197
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
>> HERE'S WHY, PIERS.

1198
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
IF WE COULD SUDDENLY MAKE ALL

1199
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
GUNS DISAPPEAR, I WOULD HAVE A

1200
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DIFFERENT POSITION.

1201
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING

1202
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
ABOUT THIS AND READING ABOUT

1203
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
THIS.

1204
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I TEACH A CLASS CALLED GUN

1205
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
CONTROL SEMINAR AND I GET A NEW

1206
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
GROUP OF LAW STUDENTS EVERY TERM

1207
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
AND WE DISCUSS THIS IN DETAIL.

1208
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THE SIMPLE FACTS ARE GUNS EXIST.

1209
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY 1800s

1210
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1211
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
EVEN SELL U AUTOMATICS CAME INTO

1212
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
BEING IN THE LATE 1800s.

1213
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THEY ARE EASY TO MAKE AND LAST

1214
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SEVERAL HUMAN LIFETIMES WITH

1215
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
MINIMAL MAINTENANCE.

1216
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
SINCE GUNS EXIST AND WE KNOW FOR

1217
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
A FACT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

1218
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
STOP AN EVIL PERSON LIKE THE

1219
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
PERSON YOU WERE DISCUSSING

1220
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
EARLIER IN THE SHOW IS TO SHOOT

1221
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
THEM.

1222
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
>> HANG ON.

1223
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THIS IS EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT I

1224
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HAVE BEEN HEARING EVER SINCE I

1225
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
JOINED CNN.

1226
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I JOINED ON AIR ABOUT A WEEK

1227
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
AFTER GABBY GIFFORDS THE

1228
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
CONGRESSWOMAN WAS SHOT IN THE
HEAD.

1229
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
EVER SINCE THEN, WE HAVE THE

1230
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
SIKH TEMPLE AND AURORA AND THE

1231
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
SHOPPING MALL AND SO ON AND SO

1232
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ON.

1233
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
GUY DOWNSTAIRS SHOT IN FRONT OF

1234
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
OUR NEW YORK BUREAU.
THE ARGUMENT I KEEP HEARING IF

1235
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
EVERYBODY WAS WAS ARMED, IT

1236
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

1237
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
IT'S HOG WASH, ISN'T IT?

1238
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

1239
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
THEATER HAD GUNS, MORE PEOPLE

1240
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE

1241
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
MAYHEM THAT ERUPTED.

1242
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
>> GIVE AN EXAMPLE --

1243
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
>> THERE IS PROOF --

1244
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
>> THEY HAVE REASONABLE LAWS AND

1245
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
THEY HAVE 100 PEOPLE A YEAR NOT

1246
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
9,000 OR 10,000 A YEAR.

1247
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
>> LISTEN --

1248
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
>> IT WAS LOWER BEFORE GUN

1249
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
CONTROL.

1250
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
>> THEY GOT THE GUN CONTROL

1251
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
LAWS --

1252
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
>> THE POINT IS GUN CONTROL

1253
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
DIDN'T CHANGE IT.

1254
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
>> SCOTLAND IN 1996 THERE WAS A
SIMILAR SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1255
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
JUST AN AWFUL SITUATION.

1256
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
16 YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED EXACTLY

1257
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
AS THEY WERE TODAY.

1258
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
AS A RESULT OF THIS, THEY

1259
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
BROUGHT IN A HANDGUN BAN.

1260
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
162,000 HANDGUNS WERE HANDED IN.

1261
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
IT IS TIME FOR THIS.

1262
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> MURDER RATES WENT UP.

1263
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> THERE ABOUT 35 MURDERS A

1264
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
YEAR.

1265
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
>> BUT IT WAS LOWER FOR ANOTHER

1266
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
REASONING.

1267
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
>> THERE ARE 12,000 MURDERS A

1268
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
YEAR FROM GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1269
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO FOCUS

1270
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
ON THAT AND STOP TELLING ME THE

1271
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
ANSWER IS MORE GUNS.

1272
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
IT IS NOT THE ANSWER.

1273
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
>> LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN --

1274
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
>> AFTER THE BAN, IT WAS HIGHER

1275
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE BAN.

1276
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
>> YOU WANT MORE GUNS AND NOT
LESS?

1277
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN AMERICA IS

1278
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

1279
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
>> WHEN YOU BAN GUNS --

1280
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
>> HOW MANY MORE KIDS HAVE TO

1281
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
DIE BEFORE YOU GUYS SAY WE WANT

1282
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
LESS GUNS, NOT MORE?

1283
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
>> HE ASKED ME A QUESTION.

1284
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
>> LET HIM ANSWER THE QUESTION.

1285
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
>> I'M UPSET BECAUSE I WORRY

1286
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THAT THE GUN CONTROL LAWS THAT

1287
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
YOU'RE PUSHING HAVE KILLED

1288
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
PEOPLE.

1289
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
>> OH, WHAT A LOAD OF NONSENSE.

1290
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
NONSENSE.

1291
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
AVERAGE OF 35 KILLINGS IN

1292
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
BRITAIN A YEAR IN A PLACE OF

1293
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
BANNED HANDGUNS.

1294
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
>> BUT IT WAS MORE BEFORE THEY

1295
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
HAD THE GUN CONTROL LAWS.

1296
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
>> I HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS ALL

1297
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WEEK WITH THE SHOPPING MALL

1298
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
SHOOTING AND MONTHS IF NOT TWO
YEARS.

1299
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND FURIOUS

1300
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
FOR THESE KIDS WHO ARE BEING

1301
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
BLOWN AWAY AGAIN WITH LEGALLY

1302
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
ACQUIRED WEAPONS.

1303
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
SOME BOY WHO HAS PROBLEMS TAKES

1304
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
HIS MOTHER'S THREE WEAPONS
INCLUDING THIS RIDICULOUS

1305
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ASSAULT RIFLE AND GOES IN THE

1306
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
SCHOOL AND KILLS THESE KIDS AND

1307
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
YOU GUYS STILL WANT TO TELL ME

1308
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THE ANSWER IS MORE GUNS?

1309
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
IT IS MADNESS!

1310
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> HOW ELSE CAN YOU STOP SOMEONE

1311
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
FROM SHOOTING PEOPLE.

1312
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
WHAT ARE WE MOST ANGRY ABOUT?

1313
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
EVERY POLL SHOWS BY MASSIVE

1314
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
MAJORITIES AMERICANS AGREE WITH

1315
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
WHAT YOU SAID.

1316
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
YET WE HAVE A LOBBY.

1317
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NRA, WHO

1318
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
FUNCTION AS ENABLELERS OF MASS

1319
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
MURDERERS.

1320
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.

1321
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> THEY TERRIFY THE POLITICAL

1322
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
PEOPLE AND EVEN THOUGH

1323
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
POLLING SHOWS THAT MOST NRA

1324
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
MEMBERS WOULD SUPPORT REASONABLE

1325
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
GUN CONTROLS, THEY COME IN AND

1326
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
LIE AND SAY THEY WILL TAKE YOUR

1327
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
GUNS AWAY AND STOP ANY

1328
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THAT.

1329
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
>> NOBODY OUTSIDE THE MILITARY

1330
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
AND POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY NEEDS

1331
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
ONE OF THESE.

1332
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
NOBODY, END OF STORY.

1333
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
>> I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

1334
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
>> THE ENCOURAGING THING AND

1335
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WHAT YOU SHOULD TAKE INSPIRATION

1336
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL FRUSTRATED

1337
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
AND OUTRAGED.

1338
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
THIS CONVERSATION AND WHAT THESE

1339
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
GUYS ARE SAYING DOES NOT

1340
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
REPRESENT WHAT THE AMERICAN

1341
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
PUBLIC WANTS AND THE

1342
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
CONVERSATION THAT THE AMERICAN

1343
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
PUBLIC WANTS TO HAVE.

1344
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
WE ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF THINGS

1345
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
LIKE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1346
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
74% OF NRA MEMBERS ARE AND MOST

1347
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
GUN SALES DO NOT REQUIRE A

1348
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
BACKGROUND CHECK.

1349
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE

1350
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
ON.
THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN

1351
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
DO --
>> IT'S NOT AS THEY TRY TO TELL

1352
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
ME AN ANTI-AMERICAN THING TO SAY

1353
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT

1354
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
AND I RESPECT THE RIGHT OF EVERY

1355
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
FAMILY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

1356
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I DON'T RESPECT THE RIGHT FOR

1357
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
FAMILIES TO LOAD THEIR HOMES

1358
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WITH THESE SO A DISTURBED KID

1359
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
CAN TAKE THEM AND SOMETHING INTO
A SCHOOL.

1360
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
WE ARE ENDING THE DEBATE FOR

1361
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
NOW, BUT THIS WILL CONTINUE NEXT
WEEK.

1362
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
COME BACK NEXT WEEK WHEN YOU'VE

1363
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

1364
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR
THINKING.

1365
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
THE GUN LOBBY HAS TO CHANGE ITS

1366
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THINKING.
>> WHY DO ALL OF THESE --

1367
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
COMING NEXT, SURVIVORS FROM

1368
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
OTHER MASS SHOOTINGS SHARE THEIR

1369
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THOUGHTS ON TODAY'S APPALLING

1370
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
MASSACRE.

1371
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
>>> ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING

1372
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
IMAGES FROM THE SHOOTING, POLICE

1373
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
OFFICERS ESCORTING

1374
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL.

1375
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
ANOTHER PICTURE FROM THE MASS

1376
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
SHOOTING IN 1999.

1377
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
FROM A JEWISH CENTER IN

1378
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
CALIFORNIA.

1379
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WE HAVE A VICTIM OF THE

1380
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
SHOOTING, JOINS ME NOW.
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER JCC

1381
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
SURVIVOR, AND A SURVIVOR OF THE

1382
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
TRAGEDY IN AURORA, AND THE

1383
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
BROTHER OF A SHOOTING AT THE

1384
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

1385
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
WELCOME TO YOU ALL.

1386
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
LET ME START IF I MAY WITH JOSH.

1387
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
THIS MUST HAVE BROUGHT BACK

1388
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
AWFUL MEMORIES FOR YOU TODAY, AS

1389
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
IT DOES I WOULD IMAGINE WHENEVER

1390
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THERE IS A MASS SHOOTING IN

1391
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
AMERICA.
WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS?

1392
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
>> IT'S -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

1393
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
PUT WORDS TO WHAT I REALLY FEEL.

1394
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
IT'S A MIXTURE OF SYMPATHY AND

1395
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
DISGUST.

1396
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE

1397
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
FAMILIES AND THERE ARE PEOPLE

1398
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME

1399
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
THING AND WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT

1400
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
ARE YOU GOING THROUGH, AND

1401
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
IMMEDIATELY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS

1402
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
JUST THAT I WISH THAT THERE WAS

1403
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP

1404
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THEM.

1405
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN REALITY, IT'S

1406
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
A HELPLESS SITUATION.

1407
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
>> MINDY, YOU SURVIVED WHAT

1408
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
HAPPENED TO YOU.

1409
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THE RAGING GUN

1410
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
DEBATE, WHICH WILL BE

1411
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
PARTICULARLY VOCIFEROUS IN LIGHT

1412
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
OF THIS APPALLING ACT TODAY.

1413
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1414
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
DO YOU WISH WHAT HAPPENED AFTER

1415
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
YOU AND JOSH TOUGHER LAWS HAD

1416
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
BEEN BROUGHT IN AFTER THAT TO

1417
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

1418
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DO.

1419
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I THINK JOSH AND I AND EVERYONE

1420
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THIS WEIRD

1421
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
FAMILY WE HAVE, SURVIVORS OF GUN

1422
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
VIOLENCE, WISHES THE DAY AFTER

1423
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, NOBODY

1424
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
ELSE HAS TO GO THROUGH IT.

1425
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
UNFORTUNATELY, 13.5 YEARS LATER,

1426
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
WE'RE SITTING HERE WATCHING

1427
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
THESE TRAGEDIES UNFOLD ON A

1428
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
DAILY BASIS.

1429
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
>> YOU WERE 16 AT THE TIME OF

1430
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THE SHOOTING.

1431
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF KIDS AT THE

1432
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
SCHOOL TODAY WILL BE MUCH

1433
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
YOUNGER THAN THAT, AND THEY WILL

1434
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HAVE EITHER LOST FRIENDS OR

1435
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
PEOPLE THEY KNEW AT THE SCHOOL

1436
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR

1437
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.

1438
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE THEM?

1439
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO TRY AND

1440
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
DEAL WITH THIS?

1441
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1442
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
>> YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

1443
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
HEARTBREAKING.

1444
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

1445
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
KNOW REALLY WHAT OR HOW TO FEEL

1446
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
UNTIL FIVE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

1447
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
WHEN IT ACTUALLY KEEPS HAUNTING

1448
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
THEM AND NIGHTMARES AND FEARS

1449
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THAT KEEP COMING UP.

1450
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
JOSH CAN SPEAK TO THAT HIMSELF,

1451
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD AT THE

1452
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
TIME, AND, YOU KNOW, NOW HE'S IN

1453
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
HIS 20s AND IT HAUNTS HIM EVERY

1454
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
DAY.

1455
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I WAS 16, I KNEW WHY I WAS SHOT.

1456
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I KNEW SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL

1457
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
ME, AND EVERY DAY, MY ENTIRE

1458
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
LIFE, I'M ALMOST 30 YEARS OLD,

1459
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'M HAUNTED.

1460
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN SAY TO

1461
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
THEM THAT I AM SO, SO SORRY THEY

1462
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS, AND I

1463
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
REALLY TRULY HOPE SOMETHING WILL

1464
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
BE DONE AFTER TODAY, BECAUSE WE

1465
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
CANNOT STAND FOR THIS ANYMORE.

1466
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
>> STEVEN BARTON, YOU SURVIVED

1467
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
THE AURORA MASSACRE A FEW MONTHS

1468
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
AGO, A HUGE OUTCRY THEN AND

1469
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
PEOPLE PROMISED TO DO ALL SORTS

1470
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
OF THINGS, POLITICIAN MOUTHS THE

1471
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
USUAL RHETORIC, ABSOLUTELY

1472
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
NOTHING HAPPENED, AND LO AND

1473
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
BEHOLD, HERE WE ARE WITH AN EVEN

1474
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
WORSE TRAGEDY.

1475
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
MORE DEAD, AND THIS TIME, 20

1476
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
YOUNG KIDS.

1477
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT THE

1478
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
DEBATE THAT WILL NOW UNFOLD ON

1479
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
THIS?

1480
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
>> I MEAN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT

1481
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
SAID WE NEED A MEANINGFUL ACTION

1482
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
NOW, AND HE SAID THAT IN THE

1483
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
PAST, AND SO I'LL BE WAITING FOR

1484
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
THAT ACTION.

1485
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
IT'S A SHAME THAT 20 CHILDREN

1486
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
HAVE TO BE SLAIN FOR US TO EVEN

1487
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
START TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1488
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THE

1489
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC IS FED UP WITH

1490
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
THE LACK OF CONVERSATION ON THIS

1491
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
ISSUE.

1492
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
>> AND THERE WILL BE MORE MASS

1493
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FIVE OR

1494
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
SIX YEARS AND IN THE PREVIOUS

1495
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
FOUR DECADES IN TERMS OF THE

1496
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
PARTICULARLY APPALLING ONES.

1497
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
AND YET YOU KEEP BEING TOLD,

1498
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
WELL, NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS.

1499
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
THE SITUATION, BUT IT TRULY IS.

1500
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE, I'VE BEEN

1501
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
UTTERLY HORRIFIED, WHY I GET SO

1502
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
ANIMATED WHEN I DEBATE IT ON THE

1503
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
SHOW.

1504
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I COME FROM A COUNTRY WHERE THIS

1505
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE.

1506
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
MOVIE THEATERS, SHOPPING MALLS,

1507
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS WOULD BE

1508
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
SHOT DOWN IN AN INDISCRIMINATE

1509
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
WAY ON A BIMONTHLY BASIS.

1510
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I DON'T GET WHY AMERICANS AREN'T

1511
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
FAR MORE ANGRY.

1512
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
>> IT'S ONE THING FOR A

1513
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
POLITICIAN TO TAKE ACTION, BUT

1514
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

1515
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC DEMANDS THESE

1516
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
REFORMS, THESE CHANGES, AND THE

1517
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
POLLING IS CLEAR.

1518
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
SUPPORT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN
REFORM.

1519
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
82% OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT

1520
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1521
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
IT'S A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM WE

1522
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THAT POINT

1523
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
YET.

1524
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
>> PAULA, YOUR BROTHER WAS

1525
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
KILLED IN THE EMPIRE STATE

1526
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
BUILDING SHOOTING.

1527
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
WHEN WE TALKED BEFORE,

1528
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
YOU BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO OWN

1529
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
A HANDGUN AND A REFERENDUM

1530
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
ON GUNS WASN'T NEEDED.
WHAT DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

1531
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
>> I THINK IN THE WAKE OF TODAY

1532
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
A REFERENDUM ON GUNS IS NEEDED.

1533
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I WAS TALKING ON THE DAY MY

1534
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
BROTHER WAS MURDERED.

1535
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
AND THIS -- AS A FATHER,

1536
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN, I SEE THE

1537
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
HEARTBREAK.
WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT.

1538
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
WE HAVE 20 FAMILIES, 26 FAMILIES

1539
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
THAT ARE DEVASTATED RIGHT NOW,
