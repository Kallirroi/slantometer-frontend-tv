00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
LUCKY.
MINUTES DRAG BY, NO ANSWERS IN

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THE SCHOOL.

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND THE WORST IS OBVIOUS.

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
NOT ALL OF THE REUNIONS BETWEEN

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
PARENTS AND THE CHILD WILL BE

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
HAPPY ONES.

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> I NEED UNITS IN THE SCHOOL.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I GOT BODIES HERE.

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MULTIPLE FATALITIES INSIDE.

BY 11:50 A.M., THEY ANNOUNCE

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
MOST OF THE FATALITIES ARE

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
CHILDREN.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
IT IS ALMOST UNIMAGINE ABLE.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
27 DEATHS, 20 CHILDREN.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000

IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
DO.

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WEDDINGS.

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000

LANZA.

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
HIS BODY FOUND IN A CLASSROOM

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
AFTER HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HE WAS ARMED FOR WAR, SAY

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AUTHORITY, CARRYING TWO

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000

A SEM AUTOMATIC RIFLE FOUND IN

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HIS CAR.

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AUTHORITIES CONFUSED HIM WITH

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
HIS OLDER BROTHER, RYAN, BECAUSE

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
HE WAS CARRYING HIS I.D.

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
HE SHOT HIS OWN MOTHER IN THE

233

PRINCIPAL DAWN HOUFSPRUNG, ONE

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
OF THOSE KILLED.

236
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TODAY.

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
>> OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
FOR THE PARENTS, AND

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST, OUR

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
WELL.
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THEIR

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY.

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE.

251
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AND THE SIX DEGREES OF

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SEPARATIONS, WE KNOW THOSE

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
FAMILIES.
THERE WILL BE FAMILIES AND

254
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
FRIENDS WE KNOW.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE GOT

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HURT, RIGHT?

257
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
>> YES.

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> YOU KNOW THAT IT'S OVER?

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WAS

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
OVER.

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NEVER

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
KNOWN WHEN IT WAS OVER.

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> WELL, IT'S OVER.

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
OKAY?
YOU KNOW THAT NOW?

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
>> YES.

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>> AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE TODAY

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
HAPPENED AND IT'S OVER.
OKAY?

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
AND YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY THAT

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
YOU ARE OKAY.

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
OF COURSE, FOR THE SEAVERS, SO

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
MUCH WHY THEY WANTED TO COME

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
FORWARD, THEY FEEL FOR THE

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE NOT AS LUCKY

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
TO HAVE ELLA COME HOME.

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THE COMMUNITY, THIS IS GOING TO

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
BE WITH THEM A LONG TIME.

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> THEY SHARE IN THAT GRIEF.

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I KNOW THEY DO.

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
AND THE NEXT FEW DAY, WE ARE

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
GOING TO BE HEARING SO MANY MORE

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
STORIES OF COURAGE FROM LITTLE

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
CHILDREN AND ALSO FROM THESE

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
TEACHERS WHO HELD HANDS AND

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
PRAYED WITH THE CHILDREN AND

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
TRIED TO KEEP THE TRAGEDY FROM

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
BECOMING WORSE.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND I SPENT THE DAY THIS

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
AFTERNOON, I SPENT TIME WITH ONE

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
YOUNG WOMAN WHO WANTED US TO

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
KNOW WHAT ALL THE TEACHERS DO IN

291
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THE SCHOOL, AS SHE TOLD HER

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
STORY.
FIRST GRADE TEACHER KAITLIN ROIG

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
AND SHE SUR PRESSED HER OWN FEAR

294
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
FOR THE CHILDREN TO SAY THEY

295
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WERE GOING HAVE A CHRISTMAS.

296
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THEY WERE GOING HAVE A HANUKKAH

297
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AND COME THROUGH IT TOLL.

298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
IT WAS 9:25 IN THE MORNING WHEN

299
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
KATELIN ROIG BEGAN CLASS.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> IT WAS IN THE MORNING MEANING

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AND IT STARTED.
>> WHAT YOU DID HEAR?

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> THE SHOOTING, THE FIRST

303
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CLASSROOM.
>> YOU DID KNOW IT WAS A

304
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
SHOOTING?

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> I KNEW IT WAS A SHOOTING,

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
IMMEDIATELY.

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
>> IT WAS A REPETITIVE SOUND?

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> YEAH, THE TYPE OF GUN THAT

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
SHOOTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
AND I HEARD THAT AND I KNEW THAT

311
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
SOMETHING WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY

312
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
WRONG.
AND I GOT UP AND I CLOSED OUR

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
DOOR.

314
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
IT WASN'T LOCK SBID TOLD THE

315
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
STUDENTS WE HAD TO GET IN THE

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
BACK.
IT WAS ALL I COULD THINK OF.

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I KNEW WE HAD TO BE HIDING.

318
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
>> HOW MANY CHILDREN?

319
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000

15.
>> 15 FRIGHTENED FIRST GRADERS.

322
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
ONE CRAMPED PLACE TO HIDE.

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> YOU GOT THEM IN THE BATHROOM?

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> I PUT THEM ON TOP OF THE

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
TOILET.
AND ONE ON TOP OF THE TOILET.

326
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN THERE.

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
>> WERE YOU LAYING ON TOP OF

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEM?
>> WE WERE ALL VERY, VERY CLOSE.

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
>> DID THEY CRY?

330
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> NO -- IF THEY STARTED CRYING,

331
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I WOULD TAKE THEIR FACE AND SAY,

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

334
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I TRIED -- AND ONE OF MY

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
STUDENTS WAS SAYING THING, I

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I WILL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
TRYING TO BE COURAGEOUS AND TAKE

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
OVER.
AND I SAID, WE NEED TO STAY HERE

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
RIGHT NOW.

341
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
WE HAVE TO BE CALM AND STILL AND

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
QUIET.
>> IN THE FIRST GRADE, THEY

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
KNEW.

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>> WE WERE RIGHT THERE.

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I MEAN, WE'RE THE FIRST ROOM.

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WE HEARD IT SO CLEARLY.

347
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
OBVIOUSLY VERY WRONG.

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
>> MANY MEMBER OF THE EMERGENCY

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
UNITS FROM THIS TOWN --

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

352
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
QUIET?

353
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
>> YEAH.
>> DID YOU TELL THEM --

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
>> I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO BE

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I WAS AFRAID HE COULD HEAR US

357
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
AND JUST SHOOT THE DOOR.

358
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I SAID, WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

359
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
QUIET AND WE HAVE -- I SAID,

360
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THERE IS A BAD GUY THROUGHOUT

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
NOW.

362
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD

363
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
GUYS.
AS THE TEACHER, I'M THE

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
PROTECTOR.
FOR THEM TO SAY, I JUST WANT TO

365
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
GO HOME AND HAVE CHRISTMAS.

366
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
WAS TRYING TO TELL THEM, YOU

367
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
WILL.

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
WE WILL BE OKAY.

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
YOU HAVE TO THINK POSITIVE.

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
>> THEY SAID TO YOU, WE WANT TO

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
>> OH, YEAH.

373
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
YEAH.
M

374
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
MM-HMM.
I JUST WANT TO HUG MY MOM.

375
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

376
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THEY WERE JUST -- IT'S

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
HEARTBREAKING.

378
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
YOU KNOW?
AND YOU ARE HEARING -- I HAVE

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
NEVER BEEN A PART OF SOMETHING

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
OBVIOUSLY NEVER NEAR THIS

381
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TRAUMATIC.
SO I'M HEARING THE GUN FIRE IN

382
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THE HALLWAY AND I'M THINKING, IN

383
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
MY MIND, I'M THE FIRST

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
CLASSROOM, I'M THINKING, WE'RE

385
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
NEXT.
AND I THINK, AS A 6-YEAR-OLD,

386
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT ARE YOUR

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
THOUGHTS?

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
AND I'M THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ALMOST BE THEIR PARENT.

390
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
LIKE, I HAVE TO TELL THEM -- I

391
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
SAID TO THEM, I NEED YOU TO KNOW

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THAT I LOVE YOU ALL VERY MUCH

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AND IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

395
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
LAST THING THEY WERE GOING TO

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
HEAR.

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

398
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
DIE.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS OKAY.

399
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I WANTED THEM TO KNOW THAT

400
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
SOMEONE LOVES THEM AND I WANTED

401
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THAT TO BE THE LAST THING THEY

402
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HEARD.

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
NOT THE GUN FIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

404
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.

405
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HORRIBLE.

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I JUST WANTED ME AND MY KIDS TO

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
LIVE.
I'M NOT A HERO.

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'M JUST THINKING, WHERE CAN WE

409
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
GO?
IT HAPPENED TO BE THE BATHROOM.

410
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I WANTED IT TO BE OKAY AND I AM

411
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SO SAD THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN

412
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THE SITUATION WHO ARE NOT OKAY.

413
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO ANYONE

414
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
WHO KNEW THEM AND WAS PART OF

415
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THEIR LIVES.
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> HOW YOU DID KNOW YOU WERE

417
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
GOING TO BE OKAY?

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
>> WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED, THE

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
GUN FIRE STOPPED.

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
THE POLICE CAME AND STARTED

421
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
KNOCKING AND OBVIOUSLY, I WAS

422
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
COMPLETELY BESIDE MYSELF AND I

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
SAID, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

424
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR BADGES

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
UNDER THE DOOR AND THEY PUT

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THEIR BADGES UNDER THE DOOR AND

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'M LIKE THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

428
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
A REAL BADGE.

429
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE BADGES.

430
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
>> I SAID, IF YOU ARE A REALLY A

431
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
POLICE OFFICER YOU COULD HAVE A

432
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
WAY TO GET IN HERE, WOULD HAVE

433
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
GOTTEN IT.

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND THE KEYS

435
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
AND HE FOUND THE KEYS AND HE

436
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
UNLOCKED THE DOOR.

437
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
>> DOWN THE HILL FROM THE

438
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
SCHOOL, DOZENS OF PARENTS GATHER

439
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
AT THE FIRE HOUSE TO SEE IF

440
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THEIR CHILDREN HAD SURVIVED.

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR

442
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
CHILDREN AS YOU WALKED INTO YOUR

443
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
FIRE HOUSE?

444
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
>> WE ARE OKAY.
WE ARE OKAY.

445
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
>> DO YOU WONDER WHO DID THIS?

446
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

447
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
AND WHY.

448
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WHY?

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
YOU KNOW.
THEY'RE INNOCENT CHILDREN.

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> AND AGAIN, CHRIS, SHE WANTED

451
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
TO SAY THAT SHE KNOWS EVERY

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
SINGLE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL WAS

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DOING WHAT THEY WERE GOING FOR

454
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THE CHILDREN THEY LOVE.

455
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> AND SHE RAISES THE QUESTION,

456
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
WHY?

457
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
WHY DID THE CHILDREN HAVE TO BE

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
PUT IN THIS POSITION.

459
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AND IT BRINGS US TO THE PERSON

460
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
WHO DESERVES THE LEAST

461
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
ATTENTION.
AND THE GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA.

462
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WE TRY TO LOOK AT WHY THIS

463
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
HAPPENED AND HOPEFULLY IT'S A

464
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WINDOW TO AN UNDERSTANDING HOW

465
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
TO NOT MAKE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN.

466
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AND THAT TAKES US TO OUR CHIEF

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT

468
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
BRIAN ROSS, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

469
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE TROUBLES

470
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THAT LED HIM TO THIS HOSHT ACT.

471
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
BRIAN?

472
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
>> HE WAS ARNLED WITH GUNS AND

473
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
WENT FROM ON CURETY TO

474
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
INFAMILYMY.

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
HE WAS KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO DO

476
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
NOT PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS.

477
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
>> THE PERP RATER OF THE CRIME

478
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
IS DEAD.

479
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
>> A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT'S IN THE

481
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
MIND OF THAT SHOOTER NOW, HE'S

482
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
TAKING TO THE GRAVE WITH HIM.

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
>> TONIGHT, NO ONE YET SEEMS TO

484
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,

485
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
WHY 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA, SEEN

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000

ATTACKED THE NEWTOWN ELEMENTARY

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SCHOOL.
>> WE WILL GO BACKWARDS AS FAR

490
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
AS WE HAVE TO GO AND HOPEFULLY

491
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
STUMBLE ON ANSWERS.

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
>> ADAM LANZA WAS THE CHILD OF

>> HE WAS NOT CONNECTED.

502
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
MY SON PLAYED WITH HIM WHEN THEY

503
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WERE YOUNG.

504
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> IN HER HOME, SHE WAS VERY

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
PARTICULAR.
I JUST THINK SHE MAYBE HAD TOO

506
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
HIGH OF A STANDARD OF SOMETHING.

507
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
OR FOCUSED TOO MUCH FOR WHATEVER

508
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
REASON.

509
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> SO WAS THERE CONFLICT?

510
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
WAS THERE TENSION BETWEEN THE

511
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TWO OF THEM?
>> THE PARENT AND THE CHILD?

512
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

513
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THE PARENTS WERE DIVORCED.

514
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

A RELATIVE SAYS THAT ADAM WAS

521
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
NOT WELL.
>> THE IMPORTANT THING, HE DID

522
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
NOT JUST SNAP THIS MORNING AND

523
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
DECIDE TO ACT OUT VIOLENTLY.

524
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000

STRATEGIZIN

526
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
STRATEGIZING.

A TEACHER'S AIDE AT THE SCHOOL.

534

FOLLOWING A DAY ON CONFUSION.

HOOK MAY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT

1121
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000

CONCEALED WEAPONS WILL K BE

1145
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
TOUGH TO PICK UP ON.

1146

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
MANY GUYS CAN BE HIDDEN IN

1148
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000

BUT A STIFF THEED WALK THAT

1150
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

1151

>> WHAT IS DONE IN THE FIRST 30

1152
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
SECONDS OF A CRISIS WILL

FOR THE MOST PART, THEY ARE

1159

DOING THEIR JOB.

1160
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> SCHOOLS ARE WORKING

1161
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
DILIGENTLY AND THEY ARE GETTING

1162
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000

1163
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
RESPONDING BUT NO MEASURE IS

1164
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
100% EFFECTIVE.

1165
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
>> TONIGHT, A SHATTERED

1166
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000

1167
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
THIS CHURCH SERVICE IS A LONG

1168
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
ROAD TO HEALING.

1169
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
>> THE REALITY IS THAT 209

1170
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
CHILDREN ARE WITH THE LORD NOW.

1171
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOO YOUNG,

1172
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
AND TOO INNOCENT.

1173
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
WE JUST TOLD A YOUNG BOY ABOUT

1174
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
