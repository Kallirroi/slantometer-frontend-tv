1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THOSE THAT ARE LOST ARE YOUNG
CHILDREN.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
>> PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, BROTHERS

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
AND SISTERS WERE TAKEN FROM

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THEM.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
PEOPLE'S SPOUSES.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THE TEACHERS AND D MAIN STRAIGHT
-- ADMINISTRATORS WERE TAKEN.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
>> I HAVE TO COMMEND THE STAFF

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
OF THE SCHOOL WHO WERE THERE FOR

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THE CHILDREN WHICH IS WHAT
TEACHERS ARE ALL ABOUT.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
IT WAS MOST OBVIOUS TODAY.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
MOST OBVIOUS TODAY WHAT THEY

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
REALLY ARE ABOUT AS TEACHERS.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TO ALL OF THEM, I SAY THANKS ON

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
BEHALF OF ALL OF US.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
>>> GOOD EVENING.
BREAKING NEWS.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'M ASHLEIGH BANFIELD IN FOR

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
ERIN BURNETT TONIGHT.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I CAN TELL YOU HIS MOTHER NANCY

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FAMILY HOME HERE IN NEWTOWN, AS

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
WELL.
SHE HAD BEEN A TEACHER AT THE

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL DAWN

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
HOCHSPRUNG

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WAS AMONG THOSE KILLED AND

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
TONIGHT A FRIEND REMEMBERED HER

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
AS "QUOTE, THE KIND OF PERSON

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
YOU WOULD WANT TO BE EDUCATING

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
YOUR KIDS.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST MARY

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SHERLOCK WAS ALSO KILGED.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THIS AFTERNOON AFTERNOON THE

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
BROTHER, RYAN LANZA WAS TAKEN IN

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
FOR QUESTIONING BY POLICE AND HE

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
WAS HANDCUFFED.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
OFFICIALS DID NOT LABEL HIM A

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SUSPECT.
THE GUNMAN'S FATHER WAS ALSO

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
QUESTIONED IN RELATION TO WHAT

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TONIGHT, A NATION IN MOURNING.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
CANDLE LIGHT VIGILS WERE HELD IN

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
NEWTOWN AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THERE WAS ONE JUST OUTSIDE OF

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON,

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
D.C.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
EARLIER TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ORDERED FLAGS TO BE FLOWN AT

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HALF STAFF NATIONWIDE IN TRIBUTE

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
TO THE VICTIMS OF THIS TERRIBLE
TRAGEDY.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
IN AN EMOTIONAL ADDRESS, HE SAID

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THIS TO THE NATION.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
DO.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
AHEAD OF THEM.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT,

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL AS HE

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
.
A MASSER OF INNOCENT TINY

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
CHILDREN AND THE WEAPONS USED

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
NOTHING SHORT OF TERRIFYING.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OUR SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS BEEN

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
FOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENTS

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TODAY.
THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS FOUND IN

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DIFFERENT PLACES, VERY, VERY

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
DANGEROUS WEAPONS.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
TWO OF THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND ON

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THE SHOOTER HIMSELF N THE

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
CLASSROOM WHERE HE WAS FOUND

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
DEAD.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ONE OF THEM IS A GLOCK AND THE

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OTHER IS A CIGGING SAUER.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BOTH HANDGUNS.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
A THIRD WEAPON WAS FOUND IN A

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CAR IN A VEHICLE, MAY HAVE BEEN

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
HIS OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL.
>> IS THAT THE VEHICLE THAT HAD

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
BEEN PARKED ERRATICALLY AND

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ROPED OFF WITH THE CRIME TAPE?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> EXACTLY.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THEY WERE PAYING A LOT OF

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
ATTENTION, CLOSELY EXAMINING THE

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CAR.
THE THIRD IS A SEMIAUTOMATIC

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
KNOWN AS A BUSHMASTER .223.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE WEAPONS

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BELONGED TO HIS MOTHER.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HIS MOTHER WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
AT THE SCHOOL.
THEY WERE REGISTERED IN THE

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT, AS WELL.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
TRYING TO PIECE THIS ALL

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
TOGETHER, WHY DID SHE HAVE THOSE

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
GUNS?
HOW DID HE GET THEM?

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> JUST ONE AREA I KNOW WILL BE

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A HUGE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION FOR

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DAYS AND MONTHS TO COME.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
ANOTHER BIG QUESTION FOR SO MANY

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THE NAMES OF THESE CHILDREN.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THERE ARE 20 CHILDREN WHO DIED.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THERE ARE SIX ADULTS WHO DIED IN

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THE SCHOOL.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THERE'S NANCY, THE MOTHER WHO

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
DIED IN HER RESIDENCE.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHEN WILL WE FIND OUT THE

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
OFFICIAL IDENTITIES OF THESE

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
VICTIMS?
>> RIGHT.
LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ARE

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
TELLING US IT WILL BE TOMORROW

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
MORNING.
THEY EXPECT TO BE RELEASING THE

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
IDENTITIES.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
DILIGENTLY TO CHECK, DOUBLE

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
CHECK AND TRIPLE CHECK THAT THEY

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
OBVIOUSLY THAT EVERYONE, MEMBERS

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OF THE FAMILY HAVE BEEN

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
NOTIFIED.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
EXPECT TO HEAR THAT IN THE

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MORNING.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
>> SO SAD TO SEE BY EXCLUSION

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THEY HAVE MADE THE IDENTITIES

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OBVIOUS TO FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
DID NOT GET REUNITED WITH THEIR

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
CHILDREN BUT THE POSITIVE I.D.s

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT A FORENSIC

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
PROJECT THEY WILL BE WORKING ON

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHERE THE CHILDREN'S BODIES ARE.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
>> OUR DREW GRIFFIN HAS BEEN

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
BUSY WORKING ON WHATEVER

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
INFORMATION WE CAN FIND ON THIS

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
PERSON, THE SHOOTER.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ADAM LANZA.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT, DREW?

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> HAVING COVERED SO MANY OF

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THESE, IN FACT WITH SUSAN

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
CANDIOTTI IT IS PLAYING OUT

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
ALMOST IN A SICKENING ROUTINE A

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SHOOTER WITH A POSSIBLE MENTAL

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
HEALTH ISSUE WITH FAMILY,

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
POSSIBLY TRYING TO DEAL WITH

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THOSE ISSUES, SMAG SNAPS,

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
POWERFUL GUNS EASILY ACCESSED

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AND YOU HAVE AN OUTBURST OF

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
VIOLENCE.
THE CASE IS PLAYING OUT JUST

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
EXACTLY IN THAT ORDER.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW THE

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER HAD AN OLDER

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
BROTHER.
THAT BROTHER REPORTEDLY TOLD ABC

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
NEWS, THE BROTHER HAD A

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HE ALSO MENTIONED HIS BROTHER

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
HAD AUTISM OR WAS AUTISTIC.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
CNN HEARD THE SAME FLFGS A MAN

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WHO CALLED HIMSELF A FRIEND IN

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
NEWTOWN WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
SO WE ARE SEEING A BASE FOR SOME

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
MENTAL HEALTH QUESTIONS BEING

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
RAISED.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> ONE MORE QUESTION.

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
AND DREW, NIQUICKLY, IS ANYONE

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
TALKING ABOUT WARNING SIGNS?
>> OTHER THAN WHAT I JUST

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MENTIONED NOT YET.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I EXPECT WE WILL SEE MORE DETAIL

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
ON THAT.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
RIGHT NOW, ALSO SOMEWHAT

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
STANDARD IN THESE CASES, YOU

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WILL FIND PEOPLE SHOCKED THIS

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
IN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
LISTEN TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM A

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
FORMER CLASSMATE AND A FORMER

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SCHOOL BUS DRIVER WHO KNEW THIS

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
20-YEAR-OLD.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> JUST A KID.
>> JUST A KID.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> JUST A KID.

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> NEVER ANTI-SOCIAL?

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
>> NO.

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NO.
>> TROUBLEMAKER.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> NO.
DEFINITELY NOT.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
DID HE JUST BLEND IN TO THE

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
BACKGROUND?

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> YEAH.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OF THIS.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> THEY ARE SAYING HE WENT AFTER

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
HIS MOM AND HER CLASS OF KIDS.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
CAN YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THAT?

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> NO.

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I CANNOT.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD DO

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> SO YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WHAT?

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
>> THIS IS UNSPEAKABLE.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
GIVE ME A MOMENT.

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I WANT TO GO.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'M GOING TO GO WALK AROUND.

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID, VERY

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
POLITE.
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO ME.

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT IS A SHOCK

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO EVEN THOUGH THEM AND REALIZE

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT HE DID.

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HAPPENED THAT HE SNAPPED, HAVE

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHAT YOU AND HE TOOK SUCH

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
INNOCENT LIVES.
>> AI'M /*.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
>> I'M CONVINCED IN THE COMING

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
DAYS, EVEN TOMORROW THERE THERE

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WERE WARNING SIGNS, MENTAL

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
HEALTH ISSUES AND A FAMILY THAT

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
FELT THEY HAD NOWHERE TO TURN.

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WE HAVE SEEN IT IN VIRGINIA TECH

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND THE SHOOTING OF GABRIELLE

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
GIFFORDS IN AURORA, COLORADO.

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'M SURE WE WILL SEE THAT.

226
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WHAT WE WILL NOT SEE REALLY FOR

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE FAMILIES IS ANY KIND OF

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
EXPLANATION THAT WILL MAKE SENSE

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
OF THIS.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
RIGHT NOW IT IS JUST SENSELESS.

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
>> JUST SO UNBEARABLY DIFFICULT

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TO DIGEST, ESPECIALLY HERE ON

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE SCENE.

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WITHOUT QUESTION SOMETHING HAD

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TO BE TERRIBLY WRONG.

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
DREW GRIFFIN REPORTING FOR US

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
LIVE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THERE'S ONE NAME YOU WILL LIKELY

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HEAR MORE OF.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
HER NAME IS KATLIN ROY.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
SHE IS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER AT

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SHE IS BEING HAILED AS A HERO.

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SHE SAVED A NUMBER OF STUDENTS

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
IN HER CLASSROOM.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SHE SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY WITH DIANE

247
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
SAWYER EARLIER.

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
HAVE A LISTEN.

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> IN MY MIND I'M THINKING, YOU

250
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
KNOW, AS A 6, 7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT

251
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WHAT ARE YOUR -- I'M THINKING

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THAT I HAVE TO ALMOST BE THEIR

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
PARENT.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
LIKE I HAVE TO TELL THEM, YOU

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
KNOW SO I SAID TO THEM.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I LOVE

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND THAT IT'S

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
GOING TO BE OKAY.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
LAST THING THEY WERE GOING TO

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HEAR.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
DIE.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS OKAY.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
YOU KNOW TEACHERS.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BUT I WANTED THEM TO KNOW

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SOMEONE LOVES THEM AND LAST

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THING THAT THEY HEARD NOT THE

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
GUN FIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
JUST HORRIBLE.

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
HORRIBLE.
>> INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL STORY.

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> I'M JOINED BY THE HOPKINS

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
FAMILY, BOB AND HIS CHILDREN

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
JULIA AND BOBBY.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
BOB, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
FRIEND OF YOURS WHO'S A

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
BASKETBALL COACH HERE IN TOWN

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WHO HAS TWO CHILDREN ATTENDING

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SANDY HOOK.

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN WAS A

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
FIRST GRADER WHO WITNESSED

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
UNBELIEVABLE.
I WANT YOU TO RECOUNT FOR ME THE

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
STORY IF YOU WILL.

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

286
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
JUST SPOKE TO THEM AN HOUR OR SO

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AGO.
ANY WAY, HIS YOUNG SON WAS IN

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CLASS AND THE SHOOTER BROKE IN

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
TO THE CLASSROOM AN AND IN FRONT

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
OF HIS EYES GUNNED DOWN THE

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TEACHER.
HE WAS ASTUTE ENOUGH TO TAKE A

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
COUPLE OF THE STUDENTS AND HE

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
RAN OUT THE DOOR BEHIND THE BACK

294
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
OF THE SHOOTER AND RAN OUT OF

295
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THE SCHOOL AND CONTINUED TO RUN

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
FOR A HALF MILE UNTIL HE HIT THE

297
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
MAIN ROAD.

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A STRANGER PICKED UP THE KIDS

299
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AND TOOK THEM TO THE NEWTOWN

300
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
UNBE KNOWNst TO THE PARENTS WHEN

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THEY WENT TO TALK TO THE STATE

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
TROOPERS, ET CETERA, THEIR SON

304
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
WAS UNACCOUNTED FOR.

305
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SO THEY TOLD THEM TO LOOK IN THE

306
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WOODS, GO DOOR TO DOOR, TALK TO

307
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
PEOPLE AND FOR AN HOUR OR SO

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE THEIR SON

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
WAS.

310
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THEY CALLED THE POLICE

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
DEPARTMENT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THEY HAD NO RECORD OF HIM BEING

313
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THERE.
FINALLY AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF

314
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THEY CALLED AND WERE RELIEVED TO

315
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
FIND OUT THEIR SON HAD BEEN

316
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
DROPPED OFF AT THE POLICE

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
DEPARTMENT SAFE LEN SOUND.

318
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> AT THAT TIME THEY MUST HAVE

319
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THOUGHT THE WORST.

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
>> THEY THOUGHT THE WORST.

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THEM.

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST HOUR

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
AND A HALF HE'S EVER EXPERIENCED

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
IN HIS LIFE.

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> POLICE INTERVIEWED THIS FIRST

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
GRADER, I'M GUESSING HE'S 6, 7

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
YEARS OLD.
>> HE'S 6 YEARS OLD.

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THEY DID INTERVIEW HIM SINCE HE

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
WAS THERE.
>> WHAT WAS HE ABLE TO TELL

331
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEM?

332
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
WHAT DETAILS.

333
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> THEY ASKED HIM, THE INTERVIEW

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
WAS VERY ELEMENTARY BUT THEY

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
ASKED WHAT HE SAW.

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
ASKED HIS RECOLLECTION OF THE

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
ROOM.
HE SAID I SAW A BUNCH OF SILVER

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
BULLETS ON THE FLOOR OF THE

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
CLASSROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT TO

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THE HALL I SAW A BUNCH OF

341
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BULLETS IN THE HALL AND THEY

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
WEREN'T SILVER.
THEY WERE RED SO UNFORTUNATELY

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
COVERED IN PLOOD IN THE HALLWAY

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AND FROM THAT POINT HE JUST RAN

345
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
AND SPRINTED AT THE SCHOOL.

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
>> DID HE GIVE A DESCRIPTION ANY

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
FURTHER ABOUT THE SHOOTER, HIS

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
FACE?
DID THE SHOOTER SAY ANYTHING.

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DID HE HAVE A LOOK IN HIS EYE,

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

351
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
>> HE DIDN'T SAY THE SHOOTER

352
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
SAID ANYTHING.
HE DESCRIBED WHAT HE LOOKED

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
LIKE.
IT IS A VERY ELEMENTARY

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
DESCRIPTION BECAUSE HE'S 6 YEARS

355
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OLD.
HIS DESCRIPTIVE SKILLS ARE NOT

356
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THAT ACUTE.

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> JULIA, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT

358
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
STORY.

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

360
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
HERE IN TOWN.

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
YOU WENT IN TO LOCKDOWN RIGHT

362
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AWAY AS SOON AS THIS HAPPENED.

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I KNOW EVERYONE HAS CELL PHONES

365
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEXT

366
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
MESSAGES BUT DID YOU KNOW WHAT

367
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
WAS GOING ON?

368
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
>> NO.
I HAD NO CLUE MANY WHAT WAS

369
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
GOING ON UNTIL THE FIRST HOUR.

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
WE WERE IN LOCKDOWN.

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
A TEACHER SAID THERE WAS A

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SHOOTING DOWN THE ROAD.

373
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
>> YOU HAVE A CLASSMATE WHO HAS

374
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
A LITTLE BROTHER AT THE SCHOOL.

375
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> THE BOY I WAS SITTING NEXT TO

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
DURING THE LOCKDOWN, HIS LITTLE

377
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
BROTHER ENDED UP DYING.

378
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>> HOW DID HE FIND THAT OUT?

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
>> I'M NOT SURE.

380
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM YET

381
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TODAY BUT I KNOW DURING THE

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
LOCKDOWN HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD A

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
LITTLE BROTHER AT SANDY HOOK

385
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
SCHOOL UNTIL I FOUND OUT HIS

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
BROTHER HAD DIED.

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> HE HADN'T BEEN CONCERNED AT

388
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE TIME OF FINDING OUT THE FATE

389
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
OF HIS BROTHER WHILE HE WAS IN

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
LOCKDOWN IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
>> IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

392
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
>> BOBBY, YOU WERE IN ANOTHER

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
SCHOOL, AS WELL.

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
AND YOU ALSO FWHENT TO LOCKDOWN.

395
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE FOR YOU?

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

397
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
>> IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

398
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
BECAUSE WE WERE IN CHURCH AT THE

399
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
TIME, SCHOOL MASS AND MONDAY

400
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SE --
MONSIGNOR SAID WE NEEDED TO END

401
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
MASS AND GO IN TO LOCKDOWN AND

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
WE SAT AND WAITED.

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
WE COULD HEAR SIRENS FOR AN

404
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
HOUR.

405
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> DID YOU, LIKE YOUR SISTER,

406
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
ALSO EVENTUALLY FIND OUT WHAT

407
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
WAS GOING ON?

408
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
>> YEAH.

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WE EVENTUALLY WENT BACK TO THE

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
SCHOOL AND MY CLASS WAS LOCKED

411
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

412
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THERE HAD

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
BEEN A SHOOTING AND THERE WERE

414
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
FATALITIES BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE

415
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SERIOUSNESS OF IT UNTIL MY DAD

416
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
PICKED ME UP FROM SCHOOL AND ON

417
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THE CAR RIDE HE SAID THERE WERE

418
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
QUITE A FEW FATALITIES.

419
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

420
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> WE WENT TO THE VIGIL AT 7:00

421
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WHICH WAS EMOTIONAL.

422
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> YOU ARE AWFULLY YOUNG TO BE

423
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
DIGESTING.
NONE OF US IS HANDLING THIS WELL

424
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND YOU ARE AWFULLY YOUNG, YOU

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AND YOUR SISTER.

426
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> IT DIDN'T REALLY SINK IN.

427
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I WAS NUMB UP UNTIL THE VIGIL

428
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
AND THEN I THINK EVERYONE BROKE

429
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
DOWN AT THE VIGIL BECAUSE IT WAS

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
SO SAD TO SEE EVERYONE THERE AND

431
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
SEE ACTUALLY 28 CANDLES ON THE

432
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
ALTER TO REPRESENT THE VICTIMS.

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> ACTUALLY JUST PASS THE MIC TO

434
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
YOUR DAD.

435
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
BOB, AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT AT THE

436
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
VIGIL.
THERE WAS A LETTER READ FROM THE

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
POPE.

438
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
>> IT WAS A LETTER WRITTEN BY

439
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
POPE BENEDICT TO OUR COMMUNITY

440
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
SPECIFICALLY, WHICH WAS VERY

441
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
TOUCHING.
AND VERY MEANINGFUL AND MEANT A

442
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
GREAT DEAL TO THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY.

443
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ON TOP OF THAT IT WAS EMOTIONAL

444
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
FOR US IS MONTH SENIOR WEISS

445
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
TALKED ABOUT IN HIS HOMILY THE

446
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
TIME HE SPENT WITH THE 20

447
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
FAMILIES TODAY AND IN PARTICULAR

448
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
MENTIONED TWO LITTLE ANGELS, ONE

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
OF WHOM THE MOTHER OF THE VICTIM

450
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
SAID SHE WENT OUT RECENTLY AND

451
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
GOT HER FIRST COMMUNION DRESS

452
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS VERY

453
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND THE OTHER

454
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
LITTLE ANGEL WAS GOING TO BE

455
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
PLAYING AN ANGEL IN OUR SCHOOL

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
PLAY AT SAINT ROSE NEXT WEEK.

457
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
IT WAS A POIGNANT STORY AND VERY

458
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
EMOTIONAL FOR US TO HEAR AND

459
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
DIGEST.
>> HOW IS YOUR FRIEND, THE

460
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
BASKETBALL COACH WHOSE CHILD

461
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
WENT THROUGH THIS HARROWING

462
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
ORDEAL?
>> I THINK THE BEST WAY TO

463
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
DESCRIBE IT IS TRAUMATIZED.

464
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN, WONDERFUL

465
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
PERSON, WONDERFUL FAMILY.

466
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
ALTHOUGH HE IS INCREDIBLY

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
GRATEFUL THAT HIS SON IS SAFE,

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
HIS HEART IS CERTAINLY BLEEDING

469
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
FOR THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
CLASSROOM BECAUSE TWO OF HIS

471
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
SONS CLASSMATES DID PARISH IN

472
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
THE SAGA THEY TOLD YOU.

473
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
WHEN THE GUNMAN CAME IN, THAT

474
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
WAS THE SECOND CLASSROOM HE CAME

475
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
IN AND TWO OF THIS BOY'S

476
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
CLASSMATES WERE KILLED TODAY.

477
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
>> AND HE WITNESSED IT.

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> HE WITNESSED HIS OWN TEACHER

479
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
BEING SHOT.

480
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

481
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO ALL OF YOU

482
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HEAR.
THE NATION IS IN MOURNING WITH

483
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
EVERYBODY HERE IN NEWTOWN.

484
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY

485
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
AND HUG YOUR KIDS TIGHT.

486
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
>> WE WILL.

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> COMING UP NEXT, THE HASKINS

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
FAMILY JUST TOUCHED ON THE VIGIL

489
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
AND THE MESSAGE THAT CAME FROM

490
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD.

491
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
THE GOVERNOR WAS HERE, IN THE

492
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SENATORS WERE HERE.

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WE WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER FEEL

494
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
FOR WHAT IT WAS LIKE INSIDE THE

495
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
CHURCH LATER ON.
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS STEVE.

496
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
HE LOVES RISK.

497
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
BUT WHETHER
HE'S CLIMBING EVEREST,

498
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SCUBA DIVING THE
GREAT BARRIER REEF WITH SHARKS,

499
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
OR JUMPING INTO THE MARKET,
HE GOES WITH PEOPLE HE TRUSTS,

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WHICH IS WHY HE TRADES
WITH A COMPANY

501
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THAT DOESN'T NICKEL AND DIME
HIM WITH HIDDEN FEES.

502
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SO HE CAN WORRY
ABOUT OTHER THINGS,

503
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
LIKE WHAT THE MARKET IS DOING

504
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
AND BEING READY,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

505
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

506
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE,
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

507
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
>> THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF 27,000

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
PEOPLE.
IT IS QUIET AND SPACIOUS AND THE

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
HOUSES WHERE TREES STRETCH FOR

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
LONG PERIODS BETWEEN HOUSES AND

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
STILL A CLOSE TOWN.

512
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
AND PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER.

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEEDED

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
SOMETHING, ANYTHING TO TRY TO

515
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
COME TOGETHER AFTER THE HORRORS

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO ENDURE

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
TODAY.
THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THEIR

518
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
CHILDREN IN THIS COMMUNITY WILL

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
NO LONGER BE WITH THEM.

520
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THEY GATHERED AT A CATHOLIC

521
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
CHURCH IN TOWN CALLED SAINT ROSE

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
OF LIMA.

523
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
JASON CARROLL WAS THERE FOR THE

524
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
VIGIL AND IT WAS STANDING ROOM

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
ONLY.

526
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
THAT CAME OUT.

528
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
AS YOU SAID, THEY WANTED

529
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
SOMETHING, ANYTHING.
THEY WERE LEANING ON EACH OTHER

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
AND LEANED ON THEIR FAITH AND

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME HERE TODAY.

532
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
SPOKE TO A DEACON WHO SAID, AS

534
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
YOU SAID, WHEN YOU HAVE A

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
COMMUNITY THIS CLOSE IT SHOULD

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
BE NO SURPRISE.

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
THAT COME OUT, MOST OF THEM AT

539
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
THE CHURCH TONIGHT KNEW SOMEONE

540
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

541
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
IF IT WASN'T A CHILD IT WAS A

542
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
PARENT.
IF IT WASN'T A PARENT IT WAS A

543
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TEACHER.

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
IF IT WASN'T A TEACHER IT WAS AN

545
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ADMINISTRATOR.

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME HERE TODAY

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FOR COMFORTING WORDS THAT THEY

548
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
GOT FROM MONSIGNOR ROBERT WEISS

549
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
WHO READ A LETTER FROM THE POPE.

550
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> I CONVEY MY HEART FELT GRIEF

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
AND THE ASSURANCE OF MY PERSONAL

552
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
PRAYERS TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR

553
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
FAMILIES.

554
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
TO ALL OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY

555
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
OF NEWTOWN AND ESPECIALLY THE

556
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
PARISH OF SAINT ROSE OF LIMA.

557
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE

558
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SENSELESS TRAGEDY, I ASK GOD OUR

559
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
FATHER TO CONSOLE ALL OF THOSE

560
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WHO MOURN AND SUSTAIN THE ENTIRE

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
COMMUNITY WITH THE SPIRITUAL

562
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
STRENGTH WHICH TRIUMPHS OVER

563
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
VIOLENCE BY THE POWER OF

564
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
FORGIVENESS, HOPE AND

565
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
RECONCILING LOVE.
>> AND ONE OF THE DEACONS HERE

566
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
AT THE CHURCH WHEN I SPOKE TO

567
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
HIM ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING HE

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
SAID THROUGHOUT THE DAY HE HAD

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
RECEIVED 100 PEOPLE THAT COME

570
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THROUGH CHURCH DOORS LOOKING FOR

571
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
COMFORT AND ANSWERS.

572
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
MANY OF THEM ASKING WHY, WHY

573
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

574
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
AND ALL HE COULD SAY IS I TOLD

575
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THEM SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO

576
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
ANSWERS.

577
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
NOT NOW.
IT IS TOO SOON.

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING ONLY GOD

579
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
CAN ANSWER.
>> JASON, ONE OF THE ADULTS, ONE

580
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
OF THE SIX ADULTS KILLED IN THE

581
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SCHOOL WAS THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL

NAMED DAWN HOCHSPRUNG

583
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
.

584
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
HER?

586
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
>> YOU ARE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT

587
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
HER FROM SO MANY PEOPLE OUT

588
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
HERE.

589
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
47 YEARS OLD, TWO DAUGHTERS

590
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
THREE STEP DAUGHTERS.

591
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
SHE HAD BEEN THE PRINCIPAL AT

592
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SINCE JUNE

593
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
OF 2010.

594
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SHE WAS CONSTANTLY TWITTERING.

595
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
SO PROUD OF HER SCHOOL.

596
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TWITTERING ABOUT THE FOURTH

597
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
GRADERS JUST THIS WEEK.

598
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
FROM ALL ACCOUNTS SHE WAS A

599
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
WOMAN WHO LOVED HER STUDENT AND

600
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
HER JOB.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS CLOSE

601
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
COMMUNITY IT NO SURPRISE TO FIND

602
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A MAN OUT HERE WHO KNEW HER AND

603
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
KNEW HER WELL AND I WANT YOU TO

604
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

605
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
ABOUT HER.
>> DAWN THE PRINCIPAL AT SANDY

606
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
HOOK I HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST

607
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
SPRING.
SHE WAS AN INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR

608
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
AND TO LOSE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT

609
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
IN OUR DISTRICT IT IS SAD

610
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
BECAUSE THEY LOST A LEADER TODAY

611
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
AT SANDY HOOK.

612
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
MY PRAYERS WILL BE FOR, YOU

613
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
KNOW, OUR COMMUNITY, AS WELL.

614
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
>> AS YOU HEARD HIM SAY, LOST A

615
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
LEADER IN THIS COMMUNITY.

616
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
DEALING WITH THIS LOSS, DEALING

617
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
WITH THE PAIN AND SUFFERING,

618
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THIS IS WHAT THIS COMMUNITY WILL
BE HAVING TO TRY TO COPE WITH

619
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
FROM THIS POINT ON I MEAN FOR

620
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS AND

621
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
CERTAINLY FOR THE PARENTS OF

622
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THOSE CHILDREN.

623
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THERE'S NO SAYING HOW LONG THEY

624
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
WILL BE DEALING WITH THEIR
GRIEF.

625
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
>> SO DISTRESSING, JASON, TO

626
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
KNOW THE PRINCIPAL HAD JUST THIS

627
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
FALL IMPLEMENTED A BRAND NEW

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
SECURITY SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAD TO

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
GET BUZZED IN AT 9:30 IN THE

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
MORNING AND YET THIS WAS

631
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
PERPETRATED AGAINST HER SCHOOL.

632
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
JASON CARROLL REPORTING FOR US

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
LIVE ACROSS TOWN FROM WHERE I

634
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
AM.
PART OF THE REASON I AM WHERE I

635
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AM RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE MEDIA

636
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
HAS BEEN GETTING REGULAR UPDATES

637
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
AT THIS LOCATION, NOT ONLY FROM

638
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THE STATE POLICE BUT ALSO FROM

639
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR WHO HAS

640
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
COME AT REGULAR INTERVALS NOT

641
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
ONLY AT THE LOCATION TO BRIEF US

642
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BUT HE HAS SPOKE ON THE THE

643
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
FAMILIES.
THE FAMILIES GIVEN THE TERRIBLE

644
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
NEWS THEY WOULD NOT BE REUNITING

645
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND HE MADE

646
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
ANOTHER STOP AT THE VIGIL JASON

647
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
JUST REPORTED ON.

648
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
HERE'S SOME OF THE THINGS HE

649
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
TOLD THOSE IN GRIEF.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

650
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
MONTH SENIOR, THANK YOU VERY

651
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
MUCH FOR OPENING THIS VERY

652
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
BEAUTIFUL CHURCH SO THAT WE

653
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
MIGHT IN A COMMUNAL WAY FIND

654
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SOLACE IN ONE ANOTHER.

655
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
AS A RESULT OF THE UNSPEAKABLE

656
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
HAVING OCCURRED IN THIS

657
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
COMMUNITY.

658
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, BROTHER AND

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SISTERS WERE TAKEN FROM THEM.

660
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
PEOPLE'S SPOUSES, TEACHERS AND

661
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
ADMINISTRATORS WERE TAKEN FROM

662
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
US.
YET WE STAND IN A CHURCH AND

663
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
MANY OF US TODAY IN THE COMING

664
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
DAYS WILL RELY UPON THAT WHICH

665
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
MAY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT AND THAT WE

666
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
INHERENTLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

667
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
FAITH FOR A REASON.

668
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
AND THAT FAITH ITSELF IS GOD'S

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
GIFT FOR ALL OF US.

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
IN THESE TIMES OF TROUBLES WHEN

671
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS IN OUR

672
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
VERY MIDST, OUR FAITH IS TESTED.

673
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
NOT JUST IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE.

674
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
NOT JUST NECESSARILY OUR FAITH

675
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
IN GOD, BUT OUR FAITH IN

676
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
COMMUNITY AND WHO WE ARE AND

677
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY ARE.

678
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
IT'S IN SO MANY WAYS PERMISSIBLE

679
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
TO HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS AND THOSE

680
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
DOUBTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT

681
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WE ARE AND WHAT COMMUNITY REPS.

682
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
BUT THEN WE TURN TO UNDERSTAND

683
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AS WE TURN AROUND IN THIS ROOM

684
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
AND RECOGNIZE OUR FRIENDS AND

685
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
OUR NEIGHBORS, THOSE WE ARE DONE

686
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THINGS FOR AND THOSE WHO HAVE

687
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
DONE THINGS FOR US.

688
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THIS IS A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL

689
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
COMMUNITY LOCATED IN A GREAT AND

690
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
BEAUTIFUL STATE AND A GREAT AND

691
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
BEAUTIFUL NATION.
IN THE COMING DAYS AND IN THE

692
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
COMING WEEKS, I WOULD PRAY WITH

693
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
YOU WILL ALL EMBRACE ONE

694
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
ANOTHER.
THAT YOU LIFT ONE ANOTHER UP.

695
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE

696
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU

697
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
COLLECTIVELY WILL UNDERGO.

698
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
KEEP IN YOUR PRAYERS THE

699
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
CHILDREN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES

700
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
TODAY.

701
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
KEEP IN YOUR PRAYERS THE ADULTS

702
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES TODAY.

703
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
UNDERSTAND THAT A TEST IS JUST

704
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
THAT, THAT WHICH WE RISE TO AND

705
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
ANSWER AND RESPOND TO.

706
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
IN THE COMING DAYS, AS MANY OF

707
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
US PREPARE TO CELEBRATE THE

708
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
BIRTH OF CHRIST, UNDERSTAND THAT

709
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
THAT, TOO, WILL BRING SORROW AS

710
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
WE THINK OF THESE INSTANCES THAT

711
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
HAVE HAPPENED TO CLOSE TO THESE

712
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
DAYS.
THAT THAT TOO WILL PASS AND BE

713
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
OVERCOME.
IN ALL OF OUR PRAYERS AND THE

714
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
PRAYERS AND HOPES OF ALL OF THE

715
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000

AND MAY GOD BLESS THE ADULTS WHO

THANK YOU.

728
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
>> I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
ONE OF THE MORE POIGNANT STORIES

730
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
THAT I LEARNED TODAY FROM A

731
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
NURSE NAMED MAUREEN.

732
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
SHE WANTED TO VOLUNTEER.

733
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
WHEN SHE HEARD WHAT WAS GOING ON

734
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
AT THE SCHOOL, SHE AND ANOTHER

735
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
NURSE RACED TO THE SCHOOL TO
HELP AND FOUND THEMSELVES

736
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
SURPRISED THERE WAS NOTHING FOR

737
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
THEM TO DO.

738
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
SADLY, THEY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND

739
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE

740
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
SURVIVORS COMING OUT OF THE

741
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
SCHOOL.

742
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SO THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE

743
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
FIRE STATION WHICH WAS A STAGING

744
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
AREA FOR PARENTS TO BE REUNITED

745
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WITH THEIR KIDS.

746
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
OF COURSE IT WAS A STAGING AREA

747
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
WHERE A LOT OF PARENTS WOULDN'T

748
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
BE REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN

749
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
EITHER.
THE SAD STORY SHE TOLD ME IS THE

750
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
MOMENT THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE

751
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
AUTHORITIES HAD TO TELL THESE

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
PARENTS THERE WERE NO MORE

753
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
SURVIVORS.
ANOTHER WITNESS WHO WAS IN THAT

754
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
AREA SAID THAT THE CRIES AND THE

755
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WAILS WERE OVERWHELMING.

756
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
IT WAS ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT

757
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THINGS TO HAVE TO UNDERGO.

758
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THERE WERE TWO PRIESTS ON THE

759
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
SCENE, AS WELL.

760
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
TWO GRIEF COUNSELORS THAT WERE

761
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
THERE TO TRY TO HANDLE WHAT WAS

762
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE

763
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE.

764
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
IF YOU THINK OF IT, THERE WERE

765
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
20 KIDS AND THEY ALL HAVE

766
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
PARENTS.
ROUGHLY 50 PEOPLE HAD TO ENDURE

767
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
THAT TERRIBLE MOMENT WHEN THEY

768
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
WERE TOLD THEY WOULD LIKELY

769
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
NEVER SEE THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN.

770
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
COMING UP, A WOMAN WHO WORKS AT

771
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A DAY CARE HERE IN TOWN TELLS US

772
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
THAT MANY OF HER DAY CARE

773
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
STUDENTS HAD GRADUATED TO BECOME

774
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
STUDENTS AT SANDY HOOK

775
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
ELEMENTARY.
SHEZ SHE'S GOING TO TALK TO US

776
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
IN A MOMENT.

777
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Music is a universal language.

778
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But when I was in an accident...

779
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I was worried the
health care system

780
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
spoke a language all its own

781
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

782
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Information on my phone.

783
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

784
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

785
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So I never missed a beat.

786
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

787
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
more than 70
million Americans.

788

That's health in numbers.

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
>> HOW WAS SHE INJURED?

922
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT.

923
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF SHE WAS IN

924
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
THAT MEETING WHEREBY THE

925
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

926
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
PSYCHOLOGIST WERE SHOT DEAD?

927
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THREE OF

928
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
THESE TEACHERS IN THE MEETING

929
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
HAD EMERGED TO THE HALLWAY WHEN

930
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THE GUNSHOTS RANG OUT AND ONLY

931
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
ONE CAME BACK AND WAS INJURED IN

932
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE FOOT OR LEG AND I'M TRYING

933
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
TO PUT TOGETHER WHETHER IT MIGHT

934
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
HAVE BEEN YOUR FRIEND.

935
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SAME

936
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
PERSON BUT I'M UNCERTAIN OF

937
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
THAT.
BUT I KNOW SHE WAS SHOT IN THE

938
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
FOOT.
>> HOW ARE YOU PROCESSING THIS?

939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

940
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> IT IS HARD TO HANDLE SEEING I

941
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
HAD ALL ALL OF THESE KID SINCE

942
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THEY WERE 3.

943
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ALL OF THE

944
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
FAMILY AND THANKFUL THEY ARE

945
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
HOME ON THIS HOLIDAY WITH

946
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
PARENTS AND PRAYING IF THE ONES

947
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THAT WERE INJURED.

948
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
>> NEWTOWN IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL

949
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
AND QUIET COMMUNITY.

950
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
EVERYONE WHO GOES THROUGH A

951
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
TRAGEDY SAYS IT WOULD NEVER

952
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
OCCUR IT WOULD HAPPEN THERE AND

953
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
IT WASN'T OCCUR IT THAT WOULD

954
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
HAPPEN HERE.
>> KIT HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

955
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
IT IS SMALL, QUAINT AND QUIET

956
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
BUT IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT IT

957
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
DID HAPPEN.

958
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
>> YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS GOING

959
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
TO BE OKAY?

960
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
>> YES, I'M HOME WITH MY

961
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
PARENTS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

962
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> MICHELLE, THANK YOU FOR

963
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.

964
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY

965
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
COLLEAGUE DREW GRIFFIN.

966
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF WEAPONS

967
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
RECOVERED AT THE SCHOOL.

968
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
ALL OF THEM, A THREE WERE

969
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OWNED BY THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

970
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THEY WERE REGISTERED.

971
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
CONNECTICUT HAS SOME OF THE

972
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
TOUGHEST GUN LAWS ON THE BOOKS

973
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
IN THIS NATION AND THERE ARE NOW

974
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
CALLS FOR EVEN STRICTER GUN

975
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
CONTROL.
DREW GRIFFIN HAS BEEN LOOKING IN

976
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
TO THAT PART OF THE STORY, AS

977
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
WELL.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?

978
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>> WE KNOW THE GUNS WERE LEGALLY

979
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
OWNED BECAUSE OF CONNECTICUT'S

980
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
VERY STRICT GUN LAWS.

981
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE.

982
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THE TWO HANDGUNS IN THE STATE OF

983
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
CONNECTICUT WOULD REQUIRE A

984
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
CERTIFICATE OF POSSESSION.

985
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
A FIVE-YEAR LICENSE, AS IT IS,

986
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
TO OBTAIN AND OWN THAT WEAPON.

987
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
IT ALSO COMES WITH THE

988
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
REQUIREMENT THAT YOU GO THROUGH

989
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
A TRAINING COURSE, A HANDGUN

990
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
SAFETY COURSE.

991
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
AS FOR THAT ASSAULT RIFLE, IF

992
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THAT IS INDEED AN OPERATING SEMI

993
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
ASSAULT RIFLE, THAT GUN IS

994
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
BANNED IN CONNECTICUT.

995
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
HOWEVER, IF THE GUN WAS

996
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
PURCHASED AND IN THE POSSESSION

997
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
OF THE MOTHER PRIOR TO OCTOBER

998
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
OF 1993, THAT GUN WOULD HAVE

999
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BEEN GRANDFATHERED IN TO HER

1000
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
POSSESSION.

1001
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

1002
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
REGISTERED TO HER WITH THE

1003
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
STATE, AS WELL.

1004
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THERE ARE VERY STRICT GUN LAWS

1005
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, AND

1006
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
YES, THESE GUNS WERE ALL LEGALLY

1007
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
OWNED.

1008
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> DREW, THE SHOOTER IN THIS

1009
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
CASE, ADAM LANZA, HE HAD NO

1010
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CRIMINAL RECORD.

1011
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
NO ONE CAN FIND ANYTHING THAT

1012
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
HE'S DONE WRONG.

1013
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
WOULD THAT HAVE FACTORED IN TO

1014
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE HAD

1015
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
GREATER ACCESS TO GUNS IN THE

1016
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
STATE?

1017
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
>> BEING 20 YEARS OLD, THERE'S

1018
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
NO WAY LEGALLY HE COULD HAVE

1019
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
PURCHASED A HANDGUN, CERTIFICATE

1020
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
OR NOT.
HE WAS TOO YOUNG.

1021
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
HE COULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THAT

1022
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ASSAULT RIFLE BECAUSE IT IS

1023
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
BANNED.
YOU CAN'T BUY THEM OR OBTAIN

1024
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
THEM OR POSSESS THEM IN THE

1025
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT UNLESS YOU

1026
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
HAVE THAT GRANDFATHER CLAUSE FOR

1027
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
A GUN IN THE PAST.

1028
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
SO LEGALLY SPEAKING, HE COULD

1029
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
NOT HAVE OWNED THESE GUNS.

1030
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I THINK WE WILL TURN TO THE FACT

1031
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
THAT THEY WERE IN THE MOTHER'S

1032
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
HOME.
OBVIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE, AND HOW

1033
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
WERE THEY STORED?

1034
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
DID THE MOM KNOW HE WAS USING,

1035
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
TRAINING WITH THE GUNS?

1036
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE TYPE OF

1037
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
ISSUES, BUT AS FOR THE

1038
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
CONNECTICUT GUN LAWS, TO SAY

1039
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THIS KID COULD HAVE GONE OUT AND

1040
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
BOUGHT THESE GUNS, THE ANSWER IS

1041
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
LEGALLY NO.
>> AGAIN, A GLOCK, A SIG SAUER

1042
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
WERE FOUND ON HIS PERSON IN THE

1043
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
SCHOOL AFTER HE APPARENTLY

1044
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
KILLED HIMSELF AND A

1045
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
BUSHMASTER.223 WAS FOUND THE

1046
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
VEHICLE HE HAD LEFT ERRATICALLY

1047
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
PARKED OUTSIDE IN FRONT OF THE

1048
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
SCHOOL.

1049
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING IN TO

1050
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THAT.

1051
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
DREW GRIFFIN REPORTING LIVE FOR

1052
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
US.
I WANT TO TALK YOU THROUGH HOW

1053
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THIS PLAYED OUT.

1054
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL -- WHILE

1055
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
NOT A LARGE SCHOOL IT IS

1056
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
SOMEWHAT SPREAD OUT.

1057
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
SANDY HOOK AS A SQUARE FORMATION

1058
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
AND THE SHOOTER DEFINITELY TOOK

1059
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A CERTAIN PATH THROUGH THE

1060
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
SCHOOL.
BUT AS THEY SAID, THE OFFICIALS

1061
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
WHO SPOKE WITH US, HE WAS NOT

1062
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
RUNNING THROUGH THE HALLS AND

1063
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
SHOOTING.

1064
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
HE WAS VERY SPECIFIC WHERE HE

1065
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
TARGETED.
HAVE A LOOK AT HOW TOM FOREMAN

1066
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
LAYS THIS OUT FOR US.

1067
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
>> 9:30 THIS MORNING, IT WAS A

1068
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
FORMAL START TO THE DAY OUT

1069
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
HERE.
600 STUDENTS IN THE CLASS HERE.

1070
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
50 FACULTY MEMBERS.

1071
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE READ ON

1072
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THE LAYOUT OF THE SCHOOL OR THE

1073
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
TIME LINE.
WE ARE TRY PIECE TOGETHER ALL

1074
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
DAY LONG AS INVESTIGATORS HAVE

1075
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
AND WE HAVE SOME IDEA.

1076
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THE DAY WAS GETTING UNDERWAY.

1077
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
HAD BEEN UNDERWAY 30 MINUTES.

1078
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THERE WAS A MEETING UP HERE

1079
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
INVOLVING THE PRINCIPAL, SCHOOL

1080
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND OTHER ADULTS IN

1081
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THE AREA.

1082
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND THEN 9:40, AS BEST WE CAN

1083
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
TELL FROM WITNESSES, TEN MIGHT

1084
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
BE MINUTES LATER HE ENTERS THE

1085
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
BUILDING.
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW HE GOT PAST

1086
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
THE SECURITY SYSTEM OR IF IT WAS

1087
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
LOCKED A THAT POINT.

1088
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
WE KNOW POLICE HAVE LOOKED HARD

1089
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
AT A CAR IN THE FIRE LANE.

1090
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
IT IS SURROUND BY TAPE THE BEST

1091
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I CAN TELL THEM SUGGESTION IS

1092
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THAT IN FACT THE GUNMAN DID COME

1093
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR HERE IN

1094
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
TO THE SCHOOL.

1095
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE

1096
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING

1097
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
REPORTED HEARING GUN FIRE.

1098
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
9:41 IS WHEN THE CALLS STARTED

1099
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
TO COME IN TO 911.

1100
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THE VICE

1101
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
PRINCIPAL AND SCHOOL

1102
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
PSYCHOLOGIST IN THIS MEETING

1103
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WENT OUT

1104
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
TO THE HALL AND WENT TOWARD THAT

1105
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
GUN FIRE TO SEE WHAT WAS

1106
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
HAPPENING.
THERE WAS SHOUTING.

1107
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
MANY SHOUTS AND SHOTS AND THE

1108
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
VICE PRINCIPAL CAME BACK IN THE

1109
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
MEETING ROOM WOUNDED BUT THE

1110
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
OTHER TWO DID NOT.

1111
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
AUTHORITIES SAY ALL OF THE

1112
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED REALLY IN A

1113
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

1114
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
AND THEY SAID THE GUNMAN DID NOT

1115
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
ROAM AROUND BUT GENERALLY STAYED

1116
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
IN TWO ROOMS AND A HALLWAY UP

1117
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
HERE.

1118
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THAT'S WHERE THEY ULTIMATELY

1119
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
FOUND HIM.

1120
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
9:45, TEACHERS WERE TRYING TO

1121
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
PROTECT STUDENTS ALL THROUGHOUT

1122
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THE SCHOOL.

1123
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SOME NEAR THE GYM SAID THEY WERE

1124
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
TOLD TOLL HIDE IN CLOSETS AND

1125
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
SOME OTHERS SAY THEY WERE LET

1126
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
OUTSIDE TO FLEE.

1127
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT HAPPENED

1128
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WITH THE TEACHERS OR LATER WITH

1129
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THEM BEING HELPED OUT BY SOME

1130
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

1131
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
NONETHELESS, WE KNOW THERE WAS A

1132
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
REAL EFFORT THROUGHOUT THE

1133
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SCHOOL TO GET ALL OF THESE KIDS

1134
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
IN TO SOME SORT OF SAFETY.

1135
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THIS PICTURE, BY THE WAY, FROM

1136
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THE NEWTOWN BEE AND THERE WERE

1137
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
TEACHERS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

1138
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
ABOUT IT AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW

1139
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1140
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR AT WHAT POINT IN

1141
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
THIS PROCESS THAT THE GUNMAN

1142
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
DIED.
LAW OFFICIALS SAY NO OFFICERS

1143
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
FIRED A WEAPON, BUT THEY DID

1144
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
FIND HIM DEAD IN ONE OF THE

1145
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
ROOMS THERE, THE SUGGESTION

1146
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
PROBABLY THAT HE KILLED HIMSELF.

1147
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
WE WILL GET MORE DETAILS AS WE

1148
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
GO ON.

1149
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW.

1150
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS

1151
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL, THEY

1152
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
IMMEDIATELY SET UP A PERIMETER

1153
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
AROUND IT.
IT WAS STATE AND LOCAL POLICE

1154
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
AND OFFICERS SPRED SPREAD

1155
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING.

1156
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THEY ENTERED TO SECURE ROOMS, TO

1157
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
FIND STUDENT AND MAKE SURE IF A

1158
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
GUNMAN WAS ACTIVE IN THERE THAT

1159
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THEY GOT HIM UNDER CONTROL AND

1160
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
KILLED HIM IF THEY HAD TO.

1161
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
THEN THEY QUICKLY STARTED TO

1162
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
LEAD STUDENTS AWAY FROM THE

1163
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
SCHOOL TRYING TO GET THEM OUT TO

1164
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
SAFETY.
THIS WAS A HORRENDOUS EVENT AS

1165
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
YOU KNOW.

1166
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
VERY DIFFICULT EVEN FOR THE

1167
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
OFFICERS INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY

1168
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
HAD TO, AS YOU SAID, TELL MANY

1169
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
OF THESE CHILDREN, AVERT YOUR

1170
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
EYES, CLOSE YOUR CRIES BECAUSE

1171
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO

1172
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
LEAD THEM PAST MANY OF THE

1173
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
VICTIMS.

1174
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
OH, TOM, SUCH A DIFFICULT DETAIL

1175
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
TO LISTEN TO THAT THE CHILDREN

1176
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
HAD TO AVERT THEIR EYES AS THEY

1177
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
ESCAPED THE SCHOOL.

1178
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT THE

1179
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1180
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
SHEDS A TEAR IN PUBLIC.

1181
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
TODAY IT HAPPENED.

1182
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT'S

1183
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
MOVING TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS
AFTER THE BREAK.

1184
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
>>> THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I

1185
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

1186
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG

1187
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER.

1188
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

1189
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THEM.

1190
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

1191
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1192
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1193
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

1194
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
TONIGHT.
THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT NOW.

1195
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
IN HARD DAYS TO COME, THE

1196
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

1197
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

1198
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER, AS
PRESIDENT, TO HELP.

1199
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
OUR PHARMACIST
RECOMMENDED IT.

1200
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT.

1201
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AND THEN I HEARD ABOUT A STUDY
LOOKING AT MULTIVITAMINS

1202
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
AND THE LONG TERM
HEALTH BENEFITS.

1203
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1204
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THEY USED CENTRUM SILVER
IN THE STUDY.

1205
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
MAKES ME FEEL EVEN BETTER,
THAT'S WHAT I TAKE.

1206
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
SORRY, WE TAKE.

1207
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM.

1208
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THE MOST RECOMMENDED.
MOST PREFERRED. MOST STUDIED.

1209
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
CENTRUM,
ALWAYS YOUR MOST COMPLETE.

1210
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THERE'S A HEALTH COMPANY THAT
CAN HELP YOU STAY THAT WAY.

1211
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
WHAT'S HEALTHIER THAN THAT?

1212
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY THERE WAS SO

1213
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
MUCH CONFUSION ON WHO THE

1214
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
SHOOTER WHO PERPETRATED THIS

1215
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
TERRIBLE ACT WAS.

1216
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
THERE WAS CONFUSION BECAUSE HE

1217
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
WAS USING I.D. THAT BELONGED TO

1218
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
HIS BROTHER A BROTHER IN

1219
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
HOBOKEN, CONNECTICUT AND THAT

1220
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
CONFUSION LED POLICE TO THAT

1221
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
BROTHER'S FRONT DOOR.

1222
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
HE'S BEEN ARRESTED NOW, AS WELL

1223
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
AND JOHN BERMAN HAS THE DETAILS

1224
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
OF HOW THIS PLAYED OUT.

1225
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
>> THIS STREET WHERE I AM

1226
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
STANDING NOW HAS BEEN THE SITE

1227
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
OF A HUGE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY

1228
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
TODAY AND A HIGH NUMBER OF

1229
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
QUESTIONS.

1230
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
BEHIND ME IS THE APARTMENT

1231
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
BUILDING WHERE LIVES THE BROTHER

1232
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
OF THE SHOOTING SUSPECT,
24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA.

1233
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
HE WAS LED TO A CAR IN HANDCUFFS

1234
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

1235
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
EARLIER TODAY.

1236
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
TAKEN IN TO CUSTODY FOR

1237
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
QUESTIONING.

1238
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
ALSO, QUESTIONED ACCORDING TO TO

1239
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
SOURCES TELLING CNN TWO

1240
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
ROOMMATES OF THE BROTHER WHO

1241
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
LIVES HERE.
THEY ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE NO

1242
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
CONNECTION AT ALL TO THE

1243
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
SUSPECT.
THIS BUILDING BEHIND ME IS A

1244
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
FIVE-STORY BUILDING WITH TWO AND

1245
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENTS.

1246
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
ON THIS STREET EARLIER TODAY

1247
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
WERE HOBOKEN CITY POLICE, JERSEY

1248
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
CITY POLICE.

1249
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THERE WERE BOMB SQUAD

1250
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
REPRESENTATIVES, ALTHOUGH THEY

1251
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
DID NOT GO IN TO THE APARTMENT

1252
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
BUILDING.

1253
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
ALSO THE FBI HAD A PRESENCE

1254
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
HERE.

1255
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THE FBI DID REMOVE MATERIALS

1256
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
FROM THIS APARTMENT INCLUDING,

1257
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
WE BELIEVE, SOME KIND OF

1258
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
COMPUTER.

1259
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY

1260
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
THE BROTHER WAS TAKEN IN TO

1261
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
CUSTODY AT ALL, ESPECIALLY IN

1262
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
HANDCUFFS.

1263
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
ONE POLICE OFFICER ON THE SCENE

1264
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
DID TELL ME THAT THERE

1265
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
APPARENTLY WAS SOME CONFUSION

1266
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THAT THE BROTHER'S I.D. MAY HAVE

1267
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
BEEN FOUND ON THE SHOOTER'S BODY

1268
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

1269
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THAT IS ONE POLICE OFFICER WHO

1270
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
TOLD ME THAT.

1271
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
WE ARE NOT SURE AT THIS TIME IF

1272
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
RYAN LANZA IS STILL IN CUSTODY.

1273
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
AGAIN, HE'S THE BROTHER OF THE

1274
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
APPARENT SHOOTING SUSPECT WHO

1275
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
WAS DEAD AND ALSO THE SON OF A

1276
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED TODAY.

1277
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

1278
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
JOHN BERMAN REPORTING FROM

1279
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
HOBOKEN.
TO ADD TO THAT, THE LANZA'S

1280
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
FATHER WAS QUESTIONED BY POLICE.

1281
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
THEY ARE NOT SUSPECTS BUT HAVE

1282
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
BEEN QUESTIONED FOR ANY KIND OF

1283
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
INFORMATION THEY CAN LEND TO

1284
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THIS.

1285
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I MENTIONED BEFORE IT IS NOT

1286
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
OFTEN YOU SEE A PRESIDENT IN

1287
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
TEARS BUT IT WASN'T BUT A FEW

1288
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
HOURS THIS NEWS HIT THE

1289
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
PRESIDENT'S DESK PRETTY QUICKLY

1290
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
AND THE TOOK THOUGH AIRWAYS TO

1291
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
OFFER HIS COMFORT AND SUPPORT TO

1292
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THE VICTIMS HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1293
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
CONNECTICUT.

1294
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

1295
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

1296
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
MUELLER.
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

1297
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

1298
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
NATION.
AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL HAVE

1299
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT HE

1300
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

1301
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
HEINOUS CRIME CARE FOR THE

1302
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILY.

1303
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

1304
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

1305
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS I

1306
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS

1307
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
ANYONE ELSE WOULD AS A PARENT.

1308
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

1309
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

1310
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1311
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SAME WEATHER WELLING GRIEF THAT

1312
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I DO.

1313
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1314
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1315
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THE AGES OF FIVE TO 10 YEARS

1316
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
OLD.

1317
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1318
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1319
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1320
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

1321
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1322
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
TEACHERS.
MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEIR

1323
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
LIVES TO HELPING OUR CHILDREN

1324
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS.

1325
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

1326
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

1327
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

1328
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1329
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

1330
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

1331
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1332
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS, AS

1333
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
WELL.
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

1334
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1335
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THEIR

1336
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1337
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

1338
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

1339
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

1340
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

1341
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

1342
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
WHETHER IT IS AN ELEMENTARY

1343
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTON OR A SHOPPING

1344
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
MALL IN OREGON, OR A TEMPLE IN

1345
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

1346
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
AURORA, OR A STREET CORNER IN

1347
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
CHICAGO.

1348
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

1349
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
NEIGHBORHOODS.
THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

1350
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

1351
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

1352
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
REACTION TO PREVENT MORE

1353
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS

1354
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
OF THE POLITICS.

1355
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

1356
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

1357
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

1358
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER

1359
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
AND TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE THEM

1360
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
AND WE WILL REMIND EACH OTHER

1361
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1362
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1363
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

1364
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
TONIGHT.

1365
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

1366
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
NOW.
IN HARD DAYS TO COME, THAT

1367
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

1368
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

1369
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER, AS

1370
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
PRESIDENT, TO HELP.

1371
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

1372
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

1373
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

1374
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THE HAND TO THOSE IN NEED TO

1375
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
REMIND THAT THAT WE ARE THERE

1376
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

1377
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

1378
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES

1379
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
NOT JUST IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT

1380
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
ALSO IN OURS.

1381
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
MAY GOD BLESDS THE MEMORY OF THE

1382
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF SKIP

1383
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
CHUR, HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTED

1384
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
AND BIND UP THEIR WOUNDS.

1385
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
>> WE ARE INDEED A NATION IN

1386
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
MOURNING TONIGHT AND IT'S KNOWN

1387
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000

1392
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
TRAGEDY, AND THEN THERE'S THE

1393
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
REACTION FROM PEOPLE.

EXPRESSING THEIR SORROW AND

1403
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
THEIR HORROR AT WHAT HAS

THIS IS NOW PART OF THE STORY.

THE GLOBAL REACTION.

00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
IN THIS ERA WHERE YOU SEE THAT

1408
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
IS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ESPECIALLY.

1409
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
LOOK AT SOME OF THE TWEETS THAT

1410
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
ARE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION.

1411
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
ONE HERE IS FROM MIKE BLOOMBERG

1412
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000

HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE

00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTINGS.
THE DEATH OF SO MANY CHILDREN IS

1422
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TRULY HEART BREAKING.

1423
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000

1424
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000

INVESTIGATORS FOR THE POLICE,

1453
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
FOR THE RESPONDERS HERE.

1454
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
THIS WAS SUCH A MASSIVE CRIME

1455
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
SCENE THAT THE PROCESSING OF IT

1456
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000

1457
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WCH
