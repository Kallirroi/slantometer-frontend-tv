SCRIPTURE TELLS US, DO NOT LOSE

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HEART.

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THOUGH OUTWARDLY WE ARE WASTING

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
AWAY, INWARDLY WE ARE BEING

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
GLORY THAT FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM

ALL.
SO WE FIX OUR EYES NOT ON WHAT

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHAT IS SEEN IS TEMPORARY.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHAT IS UNSEEN IS ETERNAL.

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
FOR WE KNOW THAT THE EARTHLY

182
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AREA WE LIVE IN IS DESTROYED, WE

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HAVE A HOUSE IN GOD.

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE ETERNAL HOUSE IN HEAVEN, NOT

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
BUILT BY HUMAN HANDS.

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WE GATHER HERE IN MEMORY OF 20

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND SIX

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SCHOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SCHOOL, IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE THAT

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
COULD BE ANY TOWN IN AMERICA.

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, I COME TO OFFER

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THE LOVE AND PRAYERS OF THE

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
NATI

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
NATION.

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
YOUR GRIEF.

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
TORN APART.

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
BEAR.
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
AS THESE DIFFICULT DAYS HAVE

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
UNFOLDED, YOU'VE ALSO INSPIRED

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
US.
THE STORIES OF STRENGTH AND

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
RESOLVE AND SACRIFICE.

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
WE KNOW THAT WHEN DANGER ARRIVED

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
IN THE HALLS OF SANDY HOOK

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
ELEMENTARY, THE SCHOOL'S STAFF

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
DID NOT FLINCH.

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THEY DID NOT HESITATE.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, MARY SHERLACH,

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
VICKI SOTO, LAUREN ROUSSEAU,

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
RACHAEL DAVINO, AND ANNE MARIE

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
MURPHY, THEY RESPONDED AS WE ALL

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HOPED WE MIGHT RESPOND IN SUCH

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TERRIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES.

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WITH COURAGE AND WITH LOVE.

233
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
GIVING THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
TEACHERS WHO BARRICADED

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THEMSELVES INSIDE CLASSROOMS AND

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
KEPT STEADY THROUGH IT ALL.

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
AND REASSURED THEIR STUDENTS BY

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
SAYING WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS,

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THEY'RE COMING, SHOW ME YOUR

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
SMILE.

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
AND WE KNOW THE GOOD GUYS CAME.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO RACED

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
TO THE SCENE, HELPING TO GUIDE

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THOSE IN HARM'S WAY TO SAFETY

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
AND COMFORT THOSE IN NEED.

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
HOLDING AT BAY THEIR OWN SHOCK

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
AND THEIR OWN TRAUMA BECAUSE

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THEY HAD A JOB TO DO AND OTHERS

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
NEEDED THEM MORE.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AND THEN THERE WERE THE SCENES

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
OF THE SCHOOLCHILDREN HELPING

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ONE ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SOMETIMES DO.
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWN-UP BY SAYING,

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I KNOW KARATE, SO IT'S OKAY,

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE INSPIRED

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
US, NEWTOWN.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
VIOLENCE, IN THE FACE OF

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL, YOU LOOKED

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
YOU CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND YOU'VE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THIS IS HOW NEWTOWN WILL BE

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
REMEMBERED.
AND WITH TIME AND GOD'S GRACE,

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THAT LOVE WILL SEE YOU THROUGH.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
BUT WE AS A NATION, WE ARE LEFT

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WITH SOME HARD QUESTIONS.

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THE JOY AND ANXIETY OF

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
PARENTHOOD AS THE EQUIVALENT OF

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
HAVING YOUR HEART OUTSIDE OF

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
YOUR BODY ALL THE TIME.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WALKING AROUND.

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WITH THEIR VERY FIRST CRY, THIS

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
MOST PRECIOUS, VITAL PART OF

282
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
OURSELVES, OUR CHILD, IS

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD,

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
POSSIBLE MISHAP OR MALICE.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
EVERY PARENT KNOWS THERE'S

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO TO SHIELD

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
OUR CHILDREN FROM HARM.

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
AND YET WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THAT CHILD'S VERY FIRST STEP AND

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
EACH STEP AFTER THAT, THEY'RE

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
SEPARATING FROM US.

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THAT WE WON'T, THAT WE CAN'T

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THEY'LL SUFFER SICKNESS AND

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
SETBACKS AND BROKEN HEARTS AND

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
DISAPPOINTMENTS.

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
AND WE LEARN THAT OUR MOST

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
IMPORTANT JOB IS TO GIVE THEM

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SELF-RELIANT AND CAPABLE AND

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
RESILIENT, READY TO FACE THE

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
WORLD WITHOUT FEAR.

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS BY

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
OURSELVES.

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
IT COMES AS A SHOCK AT A CERTAIN

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
POINT WHERE YOU REALIZE, NO

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THESE

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
KIDS, YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
YOURSELF.

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THAT THIS JOB OF KEEPING OUR

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
CHILDREN SAFE AND TEACHING THEM

312
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
WELL, IS SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
DO TOGETHER.

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS AND

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
NEIGHBORS.

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
WITH THE HELP OF A COMMUNITY.

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
AND THE HELP OF A NATION.

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
AND IN THAT WAY WE COME TO

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
REALIZE THAT WE BEAR

320
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY CHILD,

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
BECAUSE WE'RE COUNTING ON

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HELP LOOK

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
AFTER OURS.

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THAT WE'RE ALL PARENTS, THAT

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
THEY'RE ALL OUR CHILDREN.

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK, CARING

327
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
IT'S OUR FIRST JOB.

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

330
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
TRULY SAY, AS A NATION, THAT

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS?

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

338
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE FROM

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
HARM?

340
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
CAN WE CLAIM AS A NATION THAT

341
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
WE'RE ALTOGETHER THERE, LETTING

342
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
THEM KNOW THAT THEY'RE LOVED,

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND TEACHING THEM TO LOVE IN

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
RETURN?

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
CAN WE SAY THAT WE'RE TRULY

346
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DOING ENOUGH, TO GIVE ALL THE

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
CHILDREN OF THIS CHILDREN THE

348
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE OUT

349
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THEIR LIVES IN HAPPINESS AND

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
WITH PURPOSE?

351
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS THE

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
LAST FEW DAYS.

353
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
IF WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES,

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
THE ANSWER IS NO.

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

356
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

357
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

358
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SHOOTINGS.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SURVIVORS, FOURTH TIME WE'VE

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
CONSOLED THE FAMILIES OF

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
VICTIMS.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
AND IN BETWEEN, THERE HAVE BEEN

367
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DEADLY

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

369
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
ALMOST DAILY REPORTS OF VICTIMS,

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN, IN SMALL

371
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
TOWNS AND BIG CITIES, ALL ACROSS

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
AMERICA, VICTIMS WHO MUCH OF THE

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
TIME THEIR ONLY FAULT WAS BEING

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
TIME.

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEX AND

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THAT IS TRUE.

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
INACTION.
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

388
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THIS.
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

389
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD, OR

390
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
ANOTHER PARENT, OR ANOTHER TOWN,

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

392
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
AND NEWTOWN, AND COMMUNITIES

394
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
FROM COLUMBINE TO BLACKSBURG

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
BEFORE THAT.
SURELY WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
TRY.

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
AND EDUCATORS, IN AN EFFORT

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

405
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
BECAUSE WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE THIS

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
AS ROUTINE.

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

411
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

412
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

414
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

415
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
FREEDOM?

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
IN ALL THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS, SO

418
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
MANY OF THEM REPRESENTED HERE

419
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
TODAY, START WITH A SIMPLE

420
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
QUESTION.

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
WHY ARE WE HERE?

422
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE MEANING?

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
WHAT GIVES OUR ACTS PURPOSE?

424
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WE KNOW THAT OUR TIME ON THIS

425
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
EARTH IS FLEETING.

426
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EACH HAVE

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
OUR SHARE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN.

428
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
THAT EVEN AFTER WE CHASE AFTER

429
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
SOME EARTHLY GOAL, WHETHER IT'S

430
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WEALTH OR POWER OR FAME OR JUST

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
SIMPLE COMFORT, WE WILL IN SOME

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
FASHION, FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
HAD HOPED.

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
WE KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW GOOD

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
OUR INTENTIONS, WE'LL ALL

436
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
STUMBLE SOMETIMES IN SOME WAY.

437
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WE'LL MAKE MISTAKES, WE'LL

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
EXPERIENCE HARDSHIP, AND EVEN

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE

440
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
RIGHT THING, WE KNOW THAT MUCH

441
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
OF OUR TIME WILL BE SPENT

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
GROPING THROUGH THE DARKNESS.

443
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
SO OFTEN UNABLE TO DISCERN GOD'S

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
HEAVENLY PLANS.

445
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN BE

446
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
SURE OF.
AND THAT IS THE LOVE THAT WE

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
HAVE.

448
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR

449
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
FAMILIES, FOR EACH OTHER.

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL CHILD'S

451
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
EMBRACE, THAT IS TRUE.

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

453
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

455
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
EYES, THAT FIERCE AND BOUNDLESS

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
LOVE WE FEEL FOR THEM, A LOVE

457
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
THAT TAKES US OUT OF OURSELVES

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
AND BINDS US TO SOMETHING

459
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
LARGER, WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
MATTERS.

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING RIGHT

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM WELL.

464
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
KINDNESS.

466
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
WE DON'T GO WRONG WHEN WE DO

467
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
THAT.

468
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE SURE OF.

469
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU, THE PEOPLE

470
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
OF NEWTOWN, HAVE REMINDED US.

471
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THAT'S HOW YOU'VE INSPIRED US.

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
YOU REMIND US WHAT MATTERS.

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THAT'S WHAT SHOULD DRIVE US

474
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
FORWARD IN EVERYTHING WE DO.

475
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
FOR AS LONG AS GOD SEES FIT TO

476
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
KEEP US ON THIS EARTH.

477
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME TO

478
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
ME, JESUS SAID, AND DO NOT

HINDER THEM.
