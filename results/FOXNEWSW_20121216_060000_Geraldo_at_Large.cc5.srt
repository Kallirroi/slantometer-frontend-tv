AGO.

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> IT HAS.

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
IT'S BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY SAD.

264
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WE HAD A CHANCE TODAY TO

PUT INTO CLARITY WHAT THESE

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN WHO

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THEM

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SUFFERED.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER STEPPING

271
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
UP TO THE MICROPHONE TODAY AND

272
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
TALKING ABOUT THE WOUNDS THAT

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THEY SUFFER ULTIMATELY CAUSED

274
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THEIR DEATH.

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THE EXAMS THAT

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
HE PURPOSELY PARTICIPATED.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
IN SEVEN OF THOSE EXAMS.

278
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OF THOSE HE SAID THE WOUNDS

279
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WERE THREE TO 11 WOUNDS ON

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THESE YOUNG KIDS.

281
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
>> SO THIS GUY TOOK THE BUSH

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
MASTER, THE 223, THE MILITARY

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
M-4.

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
STUCK IT UP TO THE CHILDREN

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
AND THEN HIT THEM EACH 3 TO 11

287
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TIMES.

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
>> THAT'S THE MEDICAL

289
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
EXAMINER'S ASSESSMENT.

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HE SAID THIS IS WHAT THESE

291
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED.

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT

293
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
CLOSE-UP WOUNDS NOT EVERYONE

294
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAS SUFFERED THE CLOSE-UP

295
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WOUNDS.
THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY A

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
QUICK THING THAT HAPPENED

297
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AROUND HIS ROOM.

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
20 CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM.

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
EACH WITH ALL OF THESE

300
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
DIFFERENT BULLET WOUNDS.

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HE SAID IT WAS A LONG RIFLE

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THAT WAS USED.
THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR SOME

303
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
OF THE OTHER WEAPONS THAT WE

304
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ALSO HEARD MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND

305
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

306
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN

307
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WORKING TO CLEAR UP THAT HOW

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
MANY WEAPONS WERE THERE?

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SOME OF THE WEAPONS AT LEAST

310
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TO THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

311
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THAT'S ALL COMING INTO

312
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CLARITY.
>> CLEAR NOW THAT THE MAIN

313
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
MURDERING WEAPON WAS THE

314
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ASSAULT RIFLE?
>> EXACTLY.

315
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICINE CALL

316
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
EXAMINER SAID SAID TODAY HE

317
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BELIEVES IT WAS A LONG RIFLE.

318
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THAT LEAVES OTHER QUESTIONS AS

319
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
TO WHAT WERE THESE GUNS DOING

320
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND THE GUNS AT THE HOME AS

321
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WELL.
>> STILL NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

322
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

323
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
AUTHORITIES SAID THERE IS SOME

324
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
EVIDENCE.

325
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THEY AREN'T SAYING WHAT OR

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
GIVE THEM DETAILS THAT WILL

327
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LEAD THEM TO THE HOW AND WHY.

328
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THEY THINK THEY ARE ON THE

329
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
RIGHT PATH OF GETTING SOME

330
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
INFORMATION ALONG THOSE LINES.

331
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> NO WORD ON A NOTE LEFT

332
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
BEHIND BY THE PERPETRATOR.

333
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
>> NO WORD AT ALL ON A NOTE AT

334
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ALL.

335
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
>> SO WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BE THE

337
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
DEVIL'S SPAWN.

338
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BECOME

339
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SO EVIL, SO WICKED, SO

340
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
DEPRAVED AS TO TAKE THESE

341
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
LIVES.

342
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> ANY ANSWER OF WHY STILL

343
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN THE

344
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SENSELESSNESS.

345
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> MOLLY LINE, THANK YOU.

346
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000

SENSE OF THIS SENSELESS

353
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
ATROCITY, THE SLAUGHTER OF

354
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
INNOCENCE THAT HAS FOREVER

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
SCARRED THIS LOVELY NEW

ENGLAND COMMUNITY.

>> IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER

358
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN.
THEY WERE VERY LITTLE.

359
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
HARD AND I GRIEVE FOR THEIR

361
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
PARENTS.

362
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I WOULD NOT EVER WANT TO BE IN

IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

368

ADULTS MAKE THEIR CHOICES.

369

THESE PRECIOUS CHILDREN, THEY

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT HIS

747
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
BROTHER, WITHOUT HIS FATHER.

748
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT A LOT

749
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OF CONTACT WITH HIS FATHER.

750
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
NOT A BAD HOME BUT PRETTY

751
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
ROUGH ON THE TWO SONS ONCE

752
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THAT FAMILY SPLIT UP.

753
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> MIKE, WHAT ABOUT THIS

754
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
NOTION THAT THE MOTHER WAS A

755
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SURVIVALIST?
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD ALL THESE

756
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
WEAPONS INCLUDING THE 223 BUSH

757
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
MASTER A WEAPON WHO ARE SUITED

758
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
FOR WAR THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

759
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
WALLS SHE A SURVIVALIST?

760
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING MORAL

761
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
IS THAT SHE HAD THE GUNS

762
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BECAUSE SHE LIVED IN THAT BIG

763
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
HOUSE PRACTICALLY BY HERSELF.

764
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SHE WAS THERE WITH THE ONE SON

765
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AS WE TALKED ABOUT

766
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.

767
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD THE GUN.

768
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE WAS PROUD OF HER GUN

769
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
COLLECTION.
RESTAURANT BAR HERE LOCALLY

770
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THAT SHE WOULD -- I WOULDN'T

771
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SAY FREQUENT.

772
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
WASN'T A BIG DRINKER.

773
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
SHE WOULD GO IN FROM TIME TO

774
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TIME AND SHE WOULD BOAST ABOUT

775
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
HER GUN COLLECTION.

776
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
SHE WAS QUITE PROUD THROUGH

777
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SOME THE REPORTING THROUGH

778
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
REUTERS THAT A LANDSCAPER CAME

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THROUGH THERE AND SHE HAD
SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE GUNS

780
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
AND TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT HOW

781
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
OFTEN SHE WOULD TAKE THE KID

782
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
OUT SHOOTING, GERALDO.

783
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
>> Geraldo: YOU MENTIONED THE

784
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER ALLEGED

785
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THIS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA

786
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HAD.
WAS HE?

787
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
WAS HE NOT AUTISTIC?

788
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
IS THAT CONFIRMED?

789
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> IT ISN'T CONFIRMED.

790
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE

791
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
STATE POLICE.
WE HAVE HEARD MENTION OF AS

792
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
BERGER SYNDROME A FORM OF

793
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AUTISM.
THAT REALLY GETS TRACED BACK

794
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO THE OLDER BROTHER RYAN

795
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
REPORTEDLY WHAT HE SAID TO THE

796
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
POLICE.
OTHER THAN THAT A LOT OF

797
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
PEOPLE KNEW HIM AND SOMETHING

798
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
GOING ON WITH THAT CHILD --

799
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THAT YOUNG MAN WHO IS INVOLVED

800
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
IN THIS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ACT

801
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THAT HE WAS VERY WITHDRAWN.

802
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SOMETIMES HE WOULD WITHDRAW TO

803
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
THE POINT WHERE HE WAS NO

804
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
LONGER FUNCTIONAL IN SCHOOL.

805
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SCHOOL.

806
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
PEOPLE WOULD SEE HIM IN THE

807
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
HALLWAYS.
HE WOULDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT.

808
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HE WOULD PULL BACK AND CLUTCH

809
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
HIS BRIEFCASE HE WOULD CARRY

810
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WITH HILL.

811
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD

812
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
DESCRIBED HIM AS A NERD

813
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING

814
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
IS HE HE WAS BRILLIANT WITH

815
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
COMPUTERS.
HE WAS KIND OF SLIGHT OF

816
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
BUILD, WALKED AROUND WITH A

817
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
POCKET PROTECTER AND THAT'S

818
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WHERE YOU GET THAT KIND OF

819
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
LABEL AND HE CERTAINLY HAD

820
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
SOME SOCIAL PROBLEMS AT THE

821
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
SAME TIME.

822
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HE DID HAVE GIFTS IN TERMS OF

823
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WORKING WITH COMPUTERS.

824
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> Geraldo: MIKE, THANKS.

825
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
DR. KEITH ABLOW JOINS US NOW.

826
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
DR. KEITH IS AS YOU KNOW ON

827
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
THE FOX NEWS MEDICAL A TEAM.

828
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
SO, DR. ABLOW, WHAT ABOUT --

829
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
FIRST OF ALL, I NEVER HEARD OF

830
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AUTISM OR AS BERGERES BEING

831
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE.

832
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
ARE WE SLANDERING THOSE WHO

833
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
HAVE THIS DEVELOPMENTAL

834
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DISABILITY?

835
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
USING IT IN THIS CONTEXT.

836
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> GERALDO, BY AND LARGE AS

837
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
BERGER'S SYNDROME AND AUTISM

838
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

839
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

840
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THESE KIDS CAN BE

841
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SELF-ABUSIVE.
THEY CAN BE VIOLENT AT TIMES

842
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE KIND HE METHODICAL

843
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
PLANNING INVOLVED HERE.

844
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THE VIOLENT USE OF WEAPONS,

845
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THE ABILITY TO TAKE THESE

846
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THINGS FROM HIS MOTHER TO KILL

847
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HIS MOTHER TO SAMINGLY PLAN

848
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEM IS NOT TYPICAL OF THAT

849
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME

850
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
EXPLANATION OTHER THAN THOSE

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
DIAGNOSES.
SO, IN THAT WAY, YES, WE ARE

852
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
DOING A DISSERVICE BECAUSE

853
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHAT

854
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
HAPPENED HERE.

855
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
IT'S ANOTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL OR

856
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER OR SET OF

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SYMPTOMS.

858
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
>> I KNOW A LOT OF GUN

859
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
COLLECTORS THEY USUALLY DON'T

860
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
COLLECT WEAPONS BIKE THE BUSH

861
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
MASTER THE GLOCK, THE SIG SO

862
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
YOUIER.
THESE WEAPONS ARE WEAPONS OF

863
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
SEVERE VIOLENCE.

864
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THESE ARE AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS,

865
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
PARTICULARLY THE CIVILIAN

866
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
VERSION OF THE M-4.

867
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

868
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IF SHE WASN'T A SURVIVALIST,

869
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WHAT WAS SHE.

870
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW

871
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
BECAUSE WE NEED MORE

872
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
INFORMATION.
AND PEOPLE CAN COLLECT ANY

873
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
GUNS THEY WANT.

874
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SHE MAY HAVE HAD ALL KINDS OF

875
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
REASONS FOR WANTING THOSE

876
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
AROUND.
WHY SHE WOULD GIVE HER SON

877
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
ACCESS TO THEM AND NOT HAVE

878
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THEM LOCKED UP WHEN IS HE A

879
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
TROUBLED YOUNG MAN AND SHE

880
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
KNOWS THAT HE IS WITHDRAWN AND

881
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
HAS SEVERE DIFFICULTIES,

882
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

883
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK YOU

884
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO

885
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SAFEGUARD THOSE THINGS FROM AN

886
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
AEMOTIONALLY DISTURBED YOUNG

887
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
MAN.
DID YOU GET HIM THE HELP IN

888
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ABSOLUTELY EVERY WAY THAT HE

889
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
NEEDED FROM A SYSTEM BY THE

890
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WAY, THE MENTAL HEALTHCARE

891
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
SYSTEM WHICH IS A NATIONAL

892
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
EMBARRASSMENT, A TRAVESTY.

893
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
ALL BUT DOESN'T EXIST.

894
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
SO, WE WILL SEE MORE OF THIS

895
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
UNTIL WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT

896
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
CREATING A MENTAL HEALTHCARE

897
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
SYSTEM IS AMERICA THAT CAN

898
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUTLIERS,

899
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
PARTICULARLY THOSE BROKEN TO

900
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
VIOLENCE.
WE DO NOT HAVE THAT SYSTEM NOT

901
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
EVEN CLOSE I'M TELLING YOU I'M

902
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A VISTA.

903
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
D-MINE NEWS GRADE IN AMERICA

904
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
AS TO THE MENTAL HEALTHCARE

905
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SYSTEM.
>> I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT

906
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THAT AND TALK MORE ABOUT IF

907
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
YOU SEE SOMETHING, SOMEONE

908
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
BEHAVING IN ABERRANT WAY YOU

909
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

910
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I KNOW IT'S A CLICHE.

911
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR Y'ALL

912
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WHEN WE COME BACK.

913
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
WHAT ABOUT MY IDEA THAT THERE

914
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
SHOULD BE A COP.

915
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

916
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WITH THE SAME VIGOR WE PROTECT

917
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
OUR GOLD, OUR BANKS, WE SHOULD

918
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
HAVE AN ARMED COP AT EVERY

919
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SINGLE SCHOOL OVER A CERTAIN

920
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
SIZE?

921
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THE KIDS WILL GET USED TO THE

922
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
COP.
IT WILL BE LIKE OFFICER CRUMP

923
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
CAN

924
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
CRUMPKE.
WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP SAFE.

925
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THE SURVIVORS AMONG CHILDREN

926
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
AND PARENTS HAVE THEIR OWN

927
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
CROSSES TO BEAR GOING FORWARD

928
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
TO CHRISTMAS AND BEYOND.

929
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HOW WILL THEY COPE?

930

STRONGER FOR IT.

1096
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OUT OF IT.

1098
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000

AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT

1101
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE OUT OF

1102
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
LOSING RACHEL, WE ALSO GAINED

1103
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000

A LOT OF SPEAKING REGARDING

1108

PROGRAMS TO DO THAT AND THAT

1112
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BROUGHT SOME HEALING.

1113
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
BUT IT IS A VERY LONG LONG

1114
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
PROCESS.

1115
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF

1116
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THE TUNNEL, BUT THE PARENTS

1117
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW,

1118
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN

1119
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
EVEN SEE A GLIMMER OF HOPE

1120
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000

1121
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000

1122

DIFFICULT ROAD I BELIEVE THEY

1128
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000

1130
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
ITSELF TO BE STROCK AND

ARMED IN THAT SCHOOL THAT

1210
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS CREEP

1211
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
FROM KILLING ALL THESE KIDS?

1212
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000

1335
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1336
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1337
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1338
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It's not real.

1339
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1340
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1341
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

please?
