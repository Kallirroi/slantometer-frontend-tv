AND 6 ADULTS?

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
AND THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ARE

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
RAISED ABOUT HIS OWN CHILDHOOD,

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000

UP TO THIS MASSACRE.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SPECIFICALLY SOME COMPUTERS THAT

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WERE SMASHED, THINGS THAT

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME CLUES
OR SOME ANSWERS?

>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, IT IS SO

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
IMPORTANT FOR INVESTIGATORS TO

TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER EVERYTHING

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THAT HAPPENED IN THE DAYS

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
LEADING UP TO THE CRIME.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WHAT WE DO WANT TO DO IS SHOW

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
YOU THE HOME.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THIS IS WHERE THE TRAGEDY TOOK

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
PLACE.
IT IS STILL CONSIDERED A CRIME

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SCENE.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
YOU CAN SEE IT'S SURROUNDED BY

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CRIME TAPE.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
INVESTIGATORS, THE POLICE, WILL

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
HOLD ON TO THIS HOME UNTIL

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH IT WITH A

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
FINE-TOOTH COMB.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WE DO KNOW THAT FIREARMS WERE A

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
LARGE PART OF NANCY LANZA'S

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
LIFE.
SHE'S DESCRIBED AS A COUNTRY

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
GIRL, A GUN ENTHUSIAST WHO

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
REALLY LIKED TO SHOOT.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WE ARE TOLD BY THE ATF, THE

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BUREAU, THEY'RE THE ONES TO

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
HANDLE THE GUNS, THE WEAPONS,

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THE FIREARMS.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THAT, IN FACT, ADAM LANZA AND

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
HIS MOM DID VISIT A GUN RANGE IN

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SHOOTING.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
NOW, AGAIN, SHE WAS A GUN

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ENTHUSIAST.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
IT APPEARS SHE WAS TEACHING HER

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SON HOW TO SHOOT.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION.

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
BUT ON FRIDAY, HER SON GOT HOLD

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OF AT LEAST THREE OF THOSE

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
FIREARMS.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
HE KILLED HER EARLY IN THE

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MORNING BEFORE SETTING OUT AND

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
LEAVING THIS HOME TO GO ON THE

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
RAMPAGE AT THE SCHOOL, ACCORDING

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
TO A REPORT IN "THE WALL STREET

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
JOURNAL," WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL BACK IN

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
2007, HE WAS APPOINTED A SCHOOL

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
PSYCHOLOGIST, AND THEY WERE VERY

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
CONCERNED NOT THAT HE WAS A

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
DANGER THAT, IN FACT, HE WAS SO

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
VULNERABLE THAT HE HIMSELF COULD

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BECOME A TARGET.

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SO ALL OF THAT IS BEING

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
INVESTIGATED.

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THE COMPUTER, SUZANNE, THAT YOU

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
MENTIONED, THAT, TOO, THERE ARE

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
REPORTS THAT THE HARD DRIVE WAS

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
BROKEN, THAT IT WAS SMASHED.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THE QUESTION, DID THAT HAPPEN

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
BEFORE HE SNAPPED, OR WAS THAT

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SOMETHING THAT HE DID ONCE HE

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
DETERMINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
GO ON THIS SHOOTING SPREE?

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SO INVESTIGATORS REALLY HOLDING

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THE INFORMATION PRETTY CLOSE

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
JUST SO THAT THEY CAN PIECE IT

198
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TOGETHER AND TRY TO RECREATE THE

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
FINAL MOMENTS LEADING UP TO THIS

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENCE, SUZANNE.

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> DEB, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA, ANY

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SENSE OF, AGAIN, THE SHOOTER'S

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
MENTAL STATE OR WHAT HE WAS

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
GOING THROUGH, OR IS THERE ANY

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
MORE INFORMATION REGARDING

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
MOTIVE OR HIS CONNECTION TO THE
SCHOOL?

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> Reporter: WE DO KNOW THAT THE

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
DETECTIVES ARE QUESTIONING A

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
FORMER DOCTOR, FORMER TEACHERS,

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE COME IN

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
CONTACT WITH HIM.

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WHAT IS SO FASCINATING ABOUT

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THIS PARTICULAR CASE, SUZANNE,

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IS THAT USUALLY WHEN THIS KIND

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OF TRAGEDY HAPPENS, THE MOTIVE

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
OF THE GUNMAN, IT'S ABLE TO BE

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PIECED TOGETHER VERY, VERY

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
QUICKLY.

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, IT SEEMS AS IF

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
HE WAS SO REMOVED FROM SOCIETY

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IN SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL WAY THAT

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THERE'S SO LITTLE INFORMATION

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THAT'S COMING OUT RIGHT NOW.

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
AND AGAIN, THAT IS PART OF THE

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
PUZZLE.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING INTO

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
IS TO WHETHER HE WAS SO ISOLATED

229
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AND WHETHER THE REASON FOR THAT

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WAS BECAUSE HE WAS ON THIS

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
DANGEROUS PATH, SUZANNE.

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
>> DEB, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD A

234
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL AT ALL?

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THERE WERE CONFLICTING REPORTS

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HIS MOTHER

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
EVER TAUGHT THERE, AND THEN THAT

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WAS DISMISSED.

239
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
DO WE KNOW WHAT THE ASSOCIATION

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WAS WITH THE SCHOOL?
HAD HE BEEN A STUDENT AT THAT

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BACK A WHILE?

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
>> Reporter: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING

243
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
FOR THAT ANSWER AS TO WHY HE

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
DECIDED TO PICK THAT SCHOOL.

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR.

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS, YOU KNOW,

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THIS HOME THAT HE MOVED INTO, HE

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 6 OR 7,

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THE SAME AGE AS THE CHILDREN

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THAT HE WENT AFTER IN THAT

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

252
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
HE WAS AT A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL

253
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HERE.

254
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE WENT

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TO A LOCAL COLLEGE AND TOOK SOME

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
COURSES THERE.

257
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
BUT AS TO WHY THAT SCHOOL, NO,

258
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR.

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
AND WHEN YOU GET INSIDE THE MIND

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
OF SOMEBODY LIKE HIM, HE COULD

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HAVE READ A REFERENCE.

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HE COULD HAVE KNOWN SOMEBODY

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THAT WENT TO THAT SCHOOL.

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IT'S JUST SO UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW.

265
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND THAT'S WHAT THE DETECTIVES

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AND ALL THE POLICE ARE TRYING TO

267
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
PIECE TOGETHER.

268
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> AND DEB, FINALLY, WE

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
UNDERSTAND THAT ADAM'S AUNT,

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
MARSHA, TOLD AN AFFILIATE THAT

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SHE OWNED HER GUNS FOR

272
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SELF-DEFENSE, BUT SHE NEVER FELT

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THREATENED.
WHY DID SHE EVEN HAVE THIS

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
COLLECTION OF GUNS, AND DO WE

275
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
KNOW HOW ACCESSIBLE THEY WERE TO

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
HER SON?

277
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, THERE

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
HAVE BEEN REPORTS, AND PEOPLE

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WHO KNEW NANCY LANZA, THAT SHE

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SIMPLY SORT OF LIKED SHOOTING,

281
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THAT SHE WAS A GUN ENTHUSIAST,

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SORT OF A COUNTRY GIRL.

283
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
YOU DRIVE OUT HERE, AND YOU

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
REALLY DO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

285
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
PRETTY MUCH OUT IN THE COUNTRY.

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THE REASONS AS TO WHY SHE HAD

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
SUCH HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS, A LOT

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OF LEGITIMATE GUN OWNERS HAVE

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THAT KIND OF WEAPONRY.

290
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY DO.
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE.

291
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
WHETHER SHE FELT SHE WAS AT RISK

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
FROM HIM, IF SHE WERE, THE

293
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
QUESTION IS IS WOULD SHE HAVE

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
LEFT THOSE GUNS UNLOCKED?

295
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WHY WEREN'T THEY LOCKED UP SO

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THAT, IN FACT, IF HE WAS A

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
DANGER EITHER TO HER OR TO

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SOMEONE ELSE, WHY WEREN'T THOSE

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
GUNS PROPERLY HOLSTERED,

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
BASICALLY, PROPERLY LOCKED UP?

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> DEB FEYERICK, THANK YOU SO

302
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

303
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
STILL A LOT OF UNANSWERED

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
QUESTIONS.
FAMILIES ARE CALLING THE

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TEACHERS AT THAT SCHOOL, SANDY

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, HEROES.

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY.

308
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THEY PROTECTED THEIR CHILDREN

309
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
FROM THAT MASSACRE, FROM THE

310
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
GUNMAN'S ASSAULT.
AND OUR OWN ANDERSON COOPER, HE

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ACTUALLY GOT A CHANCE TO SPEAK

312
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
TO ONE OF THOSE TEACHERS, JANET

313
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
VOLLMER, ABOUT WHAT IT WAS

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
ACTUALLY LIKE INSIDE THE

315
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
CLASSROOM.

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> Reporter: EXPLAIN AGAIN, YOU

317
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HEARD -- YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS

318
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
GOING WRONG.
HOW?
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE WERE IN OUR

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
CLASSROOM.

320
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE

321
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
GUNSHOTS, NOISES.

322
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
>> Reporter: YOU HEARD IT ON

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE --
>> THERE WAS A LOUDSPEAKER --

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
>> Reporter: THE PA SYSTEM.

325
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THE WAY IT NORMALLY IS BECAUSE

327
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR THINGS

328
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
UNLESS SOMEONE IS MAKING AN

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
ANNOUNCEMENT.

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THERE WERE NOISES THAT DIDN'T

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
SOUND CORRECT.

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SO THERE WASN'T ANYONE TELLING

333
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
US IT WAS A DRILL.

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WE JUST THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
NOT RIGHT.

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WE TOOK THE CHILDREN INTO WHAT

337
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WE CALL A LOCKDOWN.

338
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
AND WE GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN

339
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THE ROOM.
WE PULL THE BLINDS DOWN.

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
WE LOCK THE CLASSROOM DOORS.

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
AND WE COVER THE WINDOW OUT THE

342
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
DOOR.
>> Reporter: SO THIS IS

343
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
SOMETHING YOU HAD PRACTICED?
>> ABOUT A MONTH OR SO, DAWN

344
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
MADE SURE THAT WE DO THAT.

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
YOU KNOW, WE'D GO TO A SAFE

346
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
PLACE.
AND TYPICALLY WHETHER IT'S A

347
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
DRILL, THEY TELL US, OKAY, AND

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THEN WE EVEN EXITED THE BUILDING
FOLLOWING A CERTAIN PATH.

349
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
AND IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY,

350
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
WE'D GO DOWN TO THE SANDY HOOK

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
FIREHOUSE AND GATHER THERE,

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID THAT DAY.

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SO, YOU KNOW, WE KNEW THAT.

354
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
>> Reporter: BUT YOU SAT THE

355
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
KIDS DOWN --

356
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> WE SAT IN THE CUBBY AREA AWAY

357
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
FROM THE DOOR SO NO ONE COULD

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
SEE US AND READ THEM A STORY,

359
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
TALKED TO THEM.

360
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
YOU KNOW, THEY KEPT SAYING HOW

361
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
COME WE'RE HERE SO LONG?

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I SAID, WELL, IT WILL BE A

363
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
LITTLE LONGER.

364
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND THEY'RE 5.
YOU TELL THEM WHATEVER YOU DO TO

365
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
KEEP THEM SAFE AND KEEP THEM

366
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
CALM.

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT I'VE

368
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL WEEKEND,

369

551
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AS OPPOSED TO OTHER COUNTRIES

552
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
THAT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT
DIVISION OVER THIS ISSUE?

553
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
>> SOME OF IT DOES COME FROM A

554
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
TRADITION OF GUN OWNERSHIP FROM

555
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
A SUSPICION.
THE ORIGINAL REASON FOR THE

556
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
SECOND AMENDMENT WAS CONCERNS

557
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WERE

558
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
TRYING TO STOP AMERICANS FROM

559
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
HAVING ARMS.

560
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
SOME OF IT IS CERTAINLY THAT.

561
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
BUT, LOOK, PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA

562
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
HAVE SOME OF THAT

563
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
INDIVIDUALISTIC SPIRIT AS WELL.

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I BELIEVE A LARGE PART OF IT IS

565
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THAT OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS, WE

566
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
HAVE HAD A VERY WELL ORGANIZED,

567
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WELL-FUNDED LOBBY THAT HAS MADE

568
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ANY KIND

569
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
OF COMMON-SENSE REGULATION OF
GUNS.

570
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WE REGULATE CARS MUCH MORE THAN

571
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WE REGULATE GUNS IN THIS

572
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
COUNTRY.
WE REGULATE TOYS MORE THAN WE

573
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
REGULATE GUNS.

574
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
YOU HAVE -- GUNS CAN GO OFF IN

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY FALL,

576
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
WHEN THEY HIT THE FLOOR.

577
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
YOU'VE HAD EXAMPLES OF GUNS

578
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
GOING OFF, AND YOU CAN'T

579
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
REGULATE SO THAT THAT DOESN'T

580
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
HAPPEN.

581
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
YOU REGULATE TOYS NOT TO

582
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
MALFUNCTION LIKE THAT.

583
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THAT POWERFUL LOBBY, THE NRA,

585
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
THE NRA NOW SAYING THAT THEY ARE

586
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THEY'LL COMMENT WITH HAD THEY
GET ALL THE INFORMATION FROM

588
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THIS LATEST MASSACRE.

589
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
BUT WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME

590
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
INDICATIONS, CONGRESSMAN MANCHIN

591
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
WHO SAYS, LOOK, PERHAPS I WILL

592
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
GO AHEAD AND SUGGEST TO MY NRA

593
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
FRIENDS THAT THEY NEED TO ENGAGE

594
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
AND NEED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT

595
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
APPROACH.

596
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
IS THIS THE MOMENT THAT THAT IS

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
EVEN POSSIBLE?

598
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
>> I HOPE SO BECAUSE WHAT I HOPE

599
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THAT WE WILL DO IS NOW WE'LL

600
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
START LOOKING AT FACTS RATHER

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THAN, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONS.

602
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
THE TIME FOR EMOTIONS REMAINS

603
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000

604
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000

INTO ACTION.

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
AND THE ACTION DEPENDS ON FACTS.

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
WHY DO WE HAVE 15 TIMES AS MUCH

608
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
GUN HOMICIDE AS THE REST OF THE

609
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
WORLD?
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

610
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM OTHER

611
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000

612
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
SOME OF THESE ISSUES?

613
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WHY DO COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN HAVE

614
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THESE EXTRAORDINARILY LOW RATES

615
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
DIED."
AND THEN LATER ON WHEN WE GOT TO

733
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THE PART WHERE WE PRAYED, PRETTY

734
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
MUCH EVERY CHILD IN HERE ALL HAD

735
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
A PRAYER.
AND MANY OF THEM WERE, "MY

736
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
FRIEND JACK DIED.

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
MY FRIEND BEN DIED.

738
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MY FRIEND CHARLOTTE DIED."

739
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SO WE PRAYED.

740
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
WE PRAYED -- WE PROBABLY PRAYED

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
MORE THAN WE'VE EVER PRAYED

742
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
BEFORE.

743
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
>> Reporter: VOGELMAN KNEW THERE

744
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WOULD BE ANXIETY AMONG THE

745
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS.

746
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
SHE SAW BOTH.

747
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
>> WE WERE A LITTLE WORRIED,

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
THERE WERE KIDS, THEIR PARENTS

749
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
HAD SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT

750
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TO COME TO CLASS BECAUSE, AGAIN,

751
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
IT'S LIKE A SCHOOL, AND THEY

752
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
WERE WORRIED.
AND THE FIRST GRADE CLASS, ONE

753
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
GIRL DIDN'T WANT TO COME BECAUSE

754
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
BEN WOULDN'T BE THERE.

755
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY.

756
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
BEN WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING

757
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
RIGHT HERE ON THIS CARPET WITH
ME.

758
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE KIDS

759
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
BRING IT UP THAT "MY FRIEND BEN

760
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
DIED," I HAD TO DO THE

761
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
TAEPDANCE.

762
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
WE HAVE ATTENDANCE SIGN-IN

763
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
PAGES.

764
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
AS I WAS PUTTING THEM IN THE

765
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
BOXES LAST NIGHT, THE FIRST

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
GRADE PAGE HAD BEN'S NAME ON IT.

767
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
AND I REMEMBER THINKING, THIS IS

768
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
GOING TO BE HANGING IN THE HALL,

769
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
AND HIS NAME'S NOT GOING TO BE

770
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
SIGNED IN.

771
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD LEAVE

772
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
HIS NAME ON THERE OR TAKE IT

773
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
OFF.

774
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
SO I PRINTED ONE OUT WITH IT

775
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
OFF.
AND AS I WAS GOING UP TO ASK

776
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
PASTOR KATHY, I STARTED CRYING.

777
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
IT REALLY HIT ME.

778
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I DELETED HIS NAME.

779
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
>> Reporter: TO HELP EASE THE

780
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
GRIEF, VOGELMAN HAD THE CHILDREN

781
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
WRITE CARDS.

782
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
THIS ONE SAYS, "CHARLOTTE IS

783
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SAFE NOW."
>> YEAH, THAT'S FOR CHARLOTTE.

784
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
THAT WAS FOR LITTLE CHARLOTTE

785
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
WHO WENT HERE.

786
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
>> Reporter: CHARLOTTE WAS 6
YEARS OLD.

787
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
ANOTHER CARD READS, IN PART,

788
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

789
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
VOGELMAN SAYS SHE FELT PRIDE,

790
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
STRENGTH SHE SAW IN THE

791
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
CHILDREN.

792
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE.

793
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THEY'RE MY KIDS.

794
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THEY'RE MY KIDS.

SORRY.

804
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THEY WERE BABIES.

805

I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK.

OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET.

856
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THAT SHOULDN'T INHIBIT ANYBODY'S

857
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
RIGHT TO HUNT, TARGET SHOOT OR

858

PEOPLE JUST GET REALLY

864

FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY HEAR

865
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000

>> Reporter: SUZANNE, AS SOON AS

870
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THIS HAPPENED, I WENT BACK AND

871
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STORIES I

872
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
DID ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

873
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
GUN CONTROL CAN HAPPEN AFTER

874
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS THAT WE'VE

875
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HAD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

876
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
UNFORTUNATELY, AS WE'VE BEEN

877
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TALKING HERE, THEY'VE BEEN

878
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
HAPPENING ABOUT EVERY SIX

879
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
MONTHS.
THE MOVIE SHOOTING.

880
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
BEFORE THAT, THE ASSASSINATION

881
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
ATTEMPT OF FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN

882
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
GABBY GIFFORDS, AND THE ANSWER

883
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
ALWAYS WAS LIKELY NOTHING.

884
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
AND THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OF

885
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
DEMOCRATS.

886
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
DEMOCRATS HAVE POLITICALLY SHIED

887
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE FROM THE

888
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
PAST DECADE OR SO JUST BECAUSE

889
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IT'S BEEN BAD POLITICS FROM

890
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THEM, AND THEY LEARNED THAT THE

891
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
HARD WAY, LOSING SEATS ON THE

892
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL AND EVEN ON

893
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL IN KEY

894
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
RED OR MORE RURAL STATES AND

895
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
DISTRICTS.

896
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THIS TIME DOES SEEM TO BE

897
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOSE

898
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
DEMOCRATS WHO SHIED AWAY ARE NOW

899
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
TALKING ABOUT IT.

900
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
CHUCK SCHUMER, FOR EXAMPLE, HE

901
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
SAID THAT HE COULD PUT THAT ON

902
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THE TABLE AND MAYBE MOST

903
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
IMPORTANTLY JOE MANCHIN.

904
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000

VIRGINIA, VERY PRO-GUN, USED

906
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
HIMSELF WITH A RIFLE IN SOME OF

907
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HIS POLITICAL ADS.

908
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
HE SAYS IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT

909
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
THIS.

910
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
>> I JUST CAME WITH MY FAMILY

911
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
FROM DEER HUNTING.

912
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'VE NEVER HAD MORE THAN THREE

913
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
SHELLS IN A CLIP.

914
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET MORE

915
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THAN ONE SHOT ANYWAY AT A DEER.

916
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
JUST COMMON SENSE.

917
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
IT'S TIME -- IT'S TIME TO MOVE

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
BEYOND RHETORIC.

919
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A

920
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
COMMON-SENSE DISCUSSION AND MOVE

921
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
IN A REASONABLE WAY.

922
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
AND I ASK ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE

923
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
NRA MEMBER AND I'M A PROUD

924
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
MEMBER AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, WE

925
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
NEED TO SIT DOWN AND MOVE THIS

926
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
DIALOGUE TO A SENSIBLE,

927
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
REASONABLE APPROACH TO FIXING

928
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
PART OF IT, NOT ALL OF IT, BUT

929
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ON THE

930
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
TABLE, AND I THINK IT WILL BE.

931
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
>> Reporter: NOW, DIANNE

932
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
FEINSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

933
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
FROM CALIFORNIA, HAS ALREADY

934
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
SAID SHE'S GOT AN ASSAULT

935
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WEAPONS BAN BILL WRITTEN THAT

936
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SHE'LL PUT UP ON THE FIRST DAY

937
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
OF THE NEW CONGRESS.

938
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
OF COURSE, THE ASSAULT WEAPONS

939
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
BAN LAPSED IN 2004 WITH NOTHING

940
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
MORE THAN A SHOULDER SHRUG FROM

941
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
MOST PEOPLE UP HERE.

942
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAN ACTUALLY

943
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
GET THE VOTES DESPITE THIS NEW

944
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
TALK IS ANOTHER QUESTION.

945
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
>> DANA, YOU BRING UP A REALLY

946
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
GOOD POINT BECAUSE YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

947
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN

948
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
SITTING ON THIS, NOTHING HAS

949
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
BEEN DONE FOR YEARS.

950
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT COME OUT

951
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
VERY STRONGLY LAST NIGHT IN THAT

952
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
MEMORIAL AND BEFORE SAYING THAT,

953
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO DO

954
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
SOMETHING.
YOU CAN'T LET THIS JUST ACCEPT

955
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THAT THIS IS THE WAY THIS IS IN

956
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THE COUNTRY.

957
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE LAST

958
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
FOUR YEARS, THE PRESIDENT HAS

959
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ACTUALLY EXPANDED GUN RIGHTS.

960
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
HE SIGNED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

961
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ALLOW FOLKS TO CARRY WEAPONS ON

962
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
AMTRAK TRAINS AND IN NATIONAL

963
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
PARKS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

964
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WHAT DO WE THINK HE IS SERIOUS

965
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
ABOUT DOING?
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, THAT IS

966
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
REALLY THE BIG, OPEN QUESTION

967
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE ON

968
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
CAPITOL HILL FROM DEMOCRATS TO

969
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
REPUBLICANS, NO MATTER WHERE

970
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THEY SIT ON THIS ISSUE, SAY THAT

971
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IT IS IF SOMETHING IS DONE, IT'S

972
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
GOING TO HAVE TO COME FROM THE

973
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
BULLY PULPIT, FROM THE

974
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
PRESIDENT.
AND LISTENING TO HIM LAST NIGHT

975
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ESPECIALLY, HE DEFINITELY DID

976
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
STRIKE A DIFFERENT TONE.

977
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I MEAN, SUZANNE, YOU COVERED

978
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
HIM.
YOU SAW, HE CAMPAIGNED ON

979
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
REINSTATING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS

980
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
BAN IN 2008 BUT DIDN'T DO MUCH

981
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
ABOUT IT, DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

982
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
ABOUT IT, REALLY, BECAUSE AS I

983
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
SAID, DEMOCRATS HERE ON CAPITOL

984
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
HILL, MANY OF THEM JUST DIDN'T

985
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WANT TO TOUCH IT.

986
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THE OPEN QUESTION STILL IS THE

987
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
VOTES.
AND JUST EVEN LOOKING AHEAD,

988
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
YOU'VE GOT TO STILL TALK ABOUT

989
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
POLITICS.
THE NEXT ELECTION, 2014, YOU

990
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
HAVE A NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC

991
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
SENATORS UP FOR RE-ELECTION IN

992
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
CONSERVATIVE STATES, WHETHER IT

993
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
IS KAY HAGAN OF NORTH CAROLINA

994
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
OR MARK BEGICH OF ALASKA OR MARK

995
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
PRIOR OF ARKANSAS.

996
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING

997
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR

998
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
OFFICES BUT MAY BE RELUCTANT,

999
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
EVEN IN THE CASE OF THIS

1000
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY, TO DO MUCH

1001
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF

1002
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
GETTING PUMMELED BACK HOME.

1003
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THE ONE THING THAT MAYBE WE'RE

1004
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
HEARING MORE TALK OF IS MAYBE

1005
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
NOT SO FAR AS THE ASSAULT

1006
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
WEAPONS BAN, BUT SOMETHING TO

1007
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
CURB THOSE 30-SHOT MAGAZINES,

1008
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THINGS LIKE THAT, WHICH EVEN JOE

1009
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
MANCHIN SAYS, YOU DON'T NEED

1010
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THAT FOR ANYTHING, NOT EVEN

1011
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
HUNTING.
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

1012
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
WE KNOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

1013
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WAS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF

1014
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THINGS AT LEAST TO BEEF UP THE

1015
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
BACKGROUND PROCESS, THE

1016
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS.
THEY DROPPED THAT DURING THE

1017
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
CAMPAIGN, DURING THE RE-ELECTION

1018
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
CAMPAIGN.
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO

1019
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF THE WHITE

1020
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
HOUSE, WHAT THE PRESIDENT

1021
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
DECIDES THAT HE IS GOING TO

1022
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
STAND BEHIND AND REALLY PUSH

1023
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THROUGH CONGRESS.

1024
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
DANA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1025
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

1026
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
>>> THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE, OF

1027
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
COURSE, THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

1028
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
DEALING WITH.

1029
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
WE ARE ONLY 15 DAYS AWAY FROM

1030
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
THIS FISCAL CLIFF.
SO THE PRESIDENT AND HOUSE

1031
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER MET AGAIN

1032
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1033
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO, WELL,

1034
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO REACH THIS

1035
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
DEFICIT REDUCTION DEAL BY

1036
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
JANUARY 1st, TOP OF NEXT YEAR.

1037
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
IF THEY DON'T DO IT, AUTOMATIC

1038
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SPENDING CUTS, THEY'RE GOING TO

1039
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
GO INTO EFFECT.

1040
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
PRACTICALLY EVERYONE'S TAXES ARE

1041
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
GOING TO GO UP AS WELL.

1042
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WELL, A SOURCE IS TELLING CNN

1043
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS NOW

1044
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
AGREED, IN SOME FORM, TO RAISING

1045
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
TAXES ON PEOPLE MAKING $1

1046
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
MILLION A YEAR OR MORE.

1047
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THE WHITE HOUSE STILL WANTS A

1048
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
TAX INCREASE ON HOUSEHOLDS THAT

1049
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
ARE EARNING MORE THAN $250,000

1050
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
OR MORE.

1051
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
>>> SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOVERNOR

1052
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
ANNOUNCED HER CHOICE TO REPLACE

1053
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR JIM DEMINT.

1054
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY IS

1055
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
APPOINTING GOP CONGRESSMAN TIM

1056
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SCOTT AS DEMINT'S SUCCESSOR.

1057
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
NOW SCOTT WILL BECOME ONLY THE

1058
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SECOND AFRICAN-AMERICAN

1059
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR SINCE

1060
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
RECONSTRUCTION.
DEMINT IS RESIGNING FROM THE

1061
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
SENATE TO LEAD THE HERITAGE

1062
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
FOUNDATION.
THAT, OF COURSE, A CONSERVATIVE

1063
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THINK TANK IN WASHINGTON.

1064
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
HE MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT

1065
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
EARLIER IN THE MONTH.

1066
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>>> AND WE WANT TO DO A CHECK ON

1067
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
THE MARKETS.

1068
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
YOU SEE THE DOW IS UP 83 POINTS

1069
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
OR SO, SIGNS OF HOPE, PERHAPS,

1070
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THAT THE FISCAL CLIFF TALKS IN

1071
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
WASHINGTON AND THE PROSPECT OF

1072
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN IN

1073
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
JAPAN IS GOING TO HAVE INVESTORS

1074
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY.

1075
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
When I'm trading,
I'm so into it,

1076
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
hours can go by before
I realize

1077
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
that I haven't even
looked away from my screen.

1078
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550

1079
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
That kind of focus...

1080
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
that's what I have
when I trade.

1081
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550

1082
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
And the StreetSmart Edge trading
platform from Charles Schwab...

1083
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
...helps me keep an eye on
what's really important to me.

1084
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
It's packed with tools that
help me work my strategies,

1085
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
spot patterns and find
opportunities more easily.

1086
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
Then, when I'm ready...
act decisively.

1087
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
I can even access it from the
cloud and trade on any computer.

1088

1100
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
>>> IN THE HOURS AFTER THE

1101
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
RAMPAGE IN NEWTOWN, THE MOTHER

1102
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OF A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY IN IDAHO,

1103
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SHE WROTE AN ESSAY.

1104
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
IT IS STARTLING ABOUT HER OWN

1105
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
LIFE.
IT'S GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION

1106
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ONLINE.

1107
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
MOST OF THE TIME SHE'S A SWEET

1108
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
KID WHO LOVES HARRY POTTER AND

1109
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
STUFFED ANIMALS, BUT THEN THIS

1110
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
QUOTE.
THIS IS FROM THE MOTHER.

1111
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
A FEW WEEKS AGO, MICHAEL PULLED

1112
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
A KNIFE AND THREATENED TO KILL

1113
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
ME AND THEN HIMSELF AFTER I

1114
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
ASKED HIM TO RETURN HIS OVERDUE

1115
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
LIBRARY BOOKS.

1116
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THAT CONFLICT ENDED WITH THREE

1117
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
BURLY POLICE OFFICERS AND A

1118
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
PARAMEDIC WRESTLING MY SON TO A

1119
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
GURNEY AND AN EXPENSIVE

1120
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AMBULANCE RIDE TO THE LOCAL

1121
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
EMERGENCY ROOM.
LIZA SAYS HER SON'S I.Q. IS OFF

1122
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
THE CHARTS BUT THAT HE COULD

1123
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
SNAP AT ANY TIME.

1124
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
ANTI-PSYCHOTIC, MOOD-ALTERING

1125
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
DRUGS HAVE NOT HELPED BECAUSE

1126
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SHE SAYS SHE THINKS THAT THERE

1127
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
IS THE POTENTIAL HERE OF THIS

1128
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
CHILLING THOUGHT THAT THIS COULD

1129
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
HAPPEN.

1130
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
>> EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT A

1131
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
MASS SHOOTING, I THINK ABOUT MY

1132
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
SON.
AND I WONDER IF SOMEDAY I'LL BE

1133
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THAT MOM.

1134
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
>> I AM JOINED BY JEFF GRENIER,

1135
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
LICENSED CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

1136
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
SHE THINKS THAT HER OWN CHILD IN

1137
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
SOME WAY COULD COMMIT THE KIND

1138
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
OF CRIME THAT WE SAW FROM THIS

1139
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
YOUNG MAN, ADAM LANZA, LAST

1140
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WEEK.
WHAT KIND OF HELP IS THERE FOR

1141
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
HER AND FOR OTHER PARENTS WHO

1142
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
ARE AFRAID IN SOME WAYS OF THEIR

1143
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN?

1144
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
>> WELL, IT'S A VERY TOUGH

1145
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
TERRAIN, SUZANNE, FOR MANY OF

1146
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THESE PARENTS.

1147
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I WORK WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE

1148
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
DAY.

1149
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THEY HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE ON

1150
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
THE ONSET OF SCHIZOPHRENIA OR A

1151
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
VERY SERIOUS PERSONALITY

1152
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
DISORDER SUCH AS A SCHIZO TYPE

1153
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE

1154
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
HALLUCINATIONS BUT WE DO HAVE

1155
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THE MAGICAL THINKING AND

1156
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
ISOLATION AND SOMETIMES SOME

1157
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
NAKED AGGRESSION.

1158
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE AT

1159
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
THE TIME THEY MAY NOT BE A

1160
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS,

1161
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
YOU CAN'T GET THEM INVOLUNTARILY

1162
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
COMMITTED, ESPECIALLY IF THEY

1163
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
ARE OF AGE.

1164
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET THEM

1165
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND

1166
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
ADMITTED BY A PSYCHIATRIST

1167
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF BED

1168
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
SPACE, WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS,

1169
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THEY ARE DISCHARGED, ON

1170
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
MEDICATIONS, BUT THE MEDICATIONS

1171
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
HAVE SUCH SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS

1172
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THAT EVEN OLDER ADULTS BUT IN

1173
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
THIS CASE YOUNGER ADULTS DON'T

1174
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WANT TO TAKE THAT MEDICATION,

1175
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
AND THAT'S THE CONUNDRUM.

1176
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
>> AND SHE WRITES HERE, SHE GOES

1177
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
ON TO SAY, I DON'T BELIEVE MY

1178
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
SON BELONGS IN JAIL, BUT IT

1179
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
SEEMS LIKE THE UNITED STATES IS

1180
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
USING PRISON AS THE SOLUTION OF

1181
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
CHOICE FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE.

1182
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
WHAT KINDS OF OPTIONS DOES SHE

1183
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
HAVE?

1184
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
>> WELL, SHE CERTAINLY IS

1185
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
SPEAKING OUT OF FRUSTRATION.

1186
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WE DON'T WANT TO USE JAILS IN

1187
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
THAT WAY.

1188
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I WAS A CHIEF PSYCHOLOGIST FOR

1189
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
FEDERAL PRISON FOR MANY YEARS,

1190
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, BECAUSE A

1191
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
LOT OF THESE FOLKS COULDN'T GET

1192
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
INTO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS,

1193
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SOMETIMES THE MARSHALS, THE

1194
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
POLICE OFFICERS, WOULD BRING

1195
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
THEM TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY WERE

1196
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
SO DANGEROUS THAT YOU COULDN'T

1197
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
KEEP THEM ON THE STREETS, BUT

1198
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
YET IT WAS CRAZY, NO PUN

1199
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
INTENDED, BUT WE COULDN'T KEEP

1200
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THEM IN THE HOSPITALS.

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO AT

1202
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
THIS POINT IS TO DIAGNOSE AS

1203
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
EARLY AS POSSIBLE, MAKE SURE

1204
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
THAT WE TRY TO KEEP THE KIDS ON

1205
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THESE MEDICATIONS.

1206
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THERE ARE 15 DIFFERENT

1207
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND

1208
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
MORE BEING MADE, SO YOU DO HAVE

1209
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
TO FIND THE RIGHT MEDICATION.

1210
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE SIDE

1211
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
EFFECTS, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP

1212
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THEM IN THERAPY.

1213
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
AND PARENTS JUST HAVE TO TRY TO

1214
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
BE CONSISTENT IN MAKING SURE

1215
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
THAT THEIR KIDS GET HELP.

1216
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
>> AND JEFF, IT CERTAINLY SEEMS

1217
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE

1218
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
STIGMA.

1219
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
SOME PEOPLE STILL FEEL LIKE YOU

1220
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
CAN TREAT ANY OTHER ILLNESS, BUT

1221
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
IF IT'S A MENTAL ILLNESS, THEY

1222
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

1223
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
PEOPLE TREAT THEM BADLY.

1224
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
YOU REALLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH

1225
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
THAT AS A SOCIETY AND AS A

1226
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
CULTURE AS WELL.

1227
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
JEFF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1228
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

1229
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
PERSPECTIVE.
OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE

1230
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTING CONTINUING

1231
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
AFTER A QUICK BREAK.

1232
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
>> Reporter: HERE'S LIEUTENANT
PAUL VANCE OF THE CONNECTICUT

1233
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
STATE POLICE.

1234
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
HE'S BRIEFING REPORTERS, ALL OF

1235
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
US, ON THE INVESTIGATION.

1236
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
>> -- LITERALLY THE WORD IS

1237
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
"PLEAD."

1238
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING.

1239
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
MANY OF THE FAMILIES HAVE ASKED

1240
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
TO PLEASE AFFORD THEM THEIR

1241
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
PRIVACY AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS

1242
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
TER SHS T

1243
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

1244
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THE LIEUTENANT HAS ASKED ME TO

1245
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
PASS THAT ON TO YOU AS CONCISELY
AS POSSIBLE.

1246
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
THAT'S THE BEST WAY I CAN DO IT.

1247
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
AT THIS TIME I CAN TAKE A COUPLE

1248
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
QUESTIONS.
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN CLEAR UP

1249
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
ANYTHING.
THEN I'M GOING TO SPEAK A LITTLE

1250
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
BIT ABOUT OUR FUTURE
GET-TOGETHERS.

1251
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
>> [ INAUDIBLE ].
>> CORRECT.

1252
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
>> [ INAUDIBLE ].
>> YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME A HARD

1253
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
QUESTION, AND I'M TRYING TO

1254
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
RECALL.
THERE WERE TWO PHONE CALLS.

1255
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE

1256
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
THREATS.
THERE WERE TWO THREATS OF

1257
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
VIOLENCE.
WE CAN JUST SIMPLY SAY THAT CAME

1258
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
IN, TWO SEPARATE PHONE CALLS

1259
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
AGAINST THE SAME FACILITY, WHICH

1260
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
WAS THE CHURCH, THE CATHOLIC

1261
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
CHURCH IN TOWN.

1262
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
TWO TELEPHONE CALLS RECEIVED.

1263
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
AGAIN, AS I STATED BEFORE, THOSE

1264
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
ARE CRIMINAL ACTS.

1265
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THOSE ARE ACTS THAT ARE BEING

1266
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY

1267
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
INVESTIGATED, AND FOLLOW-UP WILL

1268
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
BE DONE BY EITHER STATE OR

1269
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES RELATIVE TO

1270
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ANY THREATS OF THAT NATURE THAT

1271
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SOMEONE SET FORTH.

1272
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THOSE WERE THE TWO THREATS.
NEXT, PLEASE.

1273
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
>> [ INAUDIBLE ] ANY INDICATION

>> CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW, AND I

1276
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO SPECULATE.

1277
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
WE JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THAT

1278
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO YOU.

1279
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
AS I'VE STATED NUMEROUS TIMES,

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
WE DEFINITELY -- WE DEFINITELY

ARE PEELING THAT ONION BACK

1282
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
LAYER BY LAYER, AND WE'LL KNOW

1283
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
ALL THAT INFORMATION.

1284
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU,

1285
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THERE'S A TEAM THAT ARE WORKING

1286
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
ON JUST THAT, WORKING WITH ATF

SURE THAT NO STONE IS LEFT

1291

UNTURNED REGARDING THAT SPECIFIC

1292
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
TRAINING, SIR.

1293
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
YES, SIR.

1294
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
>> DID HE REMOVE THE HARD DRIVE

1295
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
AT HIS HOME [ INAUDIBLE ] THAT'S

1296
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
MAKING IT DIFFICULT

1297
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
[ INAUDIBLE ].
>> I DIDN'T INDICATE WHAT

1298
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN SEIZED AT

1299
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
ANY LOCATION.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT

1300
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
INFORMATION CAME FROM.

1301
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
BUT WE DID SEIZE SIGNIFICANT

1302
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
EVIDENCE AT THE RESIDENCE.

1303
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WE ARE ANALYZING AND WILL

1304
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
ANALYZE, AND THAT'S A VERY

1305
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
PAINSTAKING PROCESS IN FORENSIC

1306
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
SCIENCE.

1307
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO
DO THAT.

1308
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
WE DON'T DISCUSS EVIDENCE, SIR,

1309
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'M SORRY.

1310
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WE DO NOT DISCUSS EVIDENCE, ITS

1311
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
CONTENT OR DETAIL WHAT IT IS.

1312
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
YES, SIR.

1313
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY JUST A COUPLE

1314
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
OF THINGS.

1315
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> YES, SIR.

1316
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
>> YOU SAID EARLIER THERE WERE

1317
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOT AND

1318
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
SURVIVED.

1319
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SIR.

1320
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
>> DO YOU KNOW WHERE -- WHAT

1321
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
LOCATION OF THE SCHOOL?
>> I CAN'T.

1322
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THE QUESTION WAS, THERE WERE TWO

1323
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
PEOPLE THAT WERE WOUNDED IN THIS

1324
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
AND DID SURVIVE, TWO ADULTS,

1325
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THAT IS CORRECT.
THERE WERE WOUNDED IN THE LOWER

1326
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
EXTREMITIES.
I DO NOT KNOW THE LOCATION IN

1327
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
THE SCHOOL.
I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

1328
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS

1329
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
WERE IN EACH CLASSROOM, HOW MANY

1330
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
SURVIVORS WERE IN EACH

1331
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
CLASSROOM?
>> NO.

1332
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
>> VERSUS HOW MANY --

1333
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
>> NO, I'M SORRY, I DON'T.

1334
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
HE'S ASKING ABOUT, DO WE HAVE

1335
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
SPECIFIC LOCATION OF SURVIVORS

1336
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
AND LOCATION OF STUDENTS AND

1337
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
FACULTY AND STAFF, AND I DON'T

1338
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
HAVE THAT, I'M SORRY.
YES, MA'AM.

1339
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
>> HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ANY OF

1340
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
THE INJURED ADULTS YET?

1341
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
>> NO, WE HAVE NOT.

1342
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
THEY'RE CONSIDERED WITNESSES,

1343
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AND WE DO NOT IDENTIFY

1344
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
WITNESSES.
YES, MA'AM.
>> IN THE CASE OF THE ELECTRONIC

1345
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
EVIDENCE WAS DESTROYED OR

1346
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
UNAVAILABLE, WILL YOU BE WORKING

1347
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
WITH INTERNET COMPANIES LIKE

1348
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
GOOGLE AND TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND

1349
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
OTHERS TO GET INFORMATION?

1350
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
>> GOOD QUESTION AND GOOD WAY TO

1351
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
ASK IT, BUT I CAN ONLY TELL YOU

1352
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WE'VE SEIZED EVIDENCE IF -- IF

1353
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
THERE IS COMPUTER EVIDENCE.
AND I STRENUOUSLY SAY THAT, IF.

1354
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
WE DO HAVE A COMPUTER TEAM, AND

1355
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
OUR STATE AND FERENTZ ORENSICS

1356
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
LABORATORY THAT ARE RETRIEVING

1357
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
ANY TYPE OF EVIDENCE AND DATA.

1358
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'LL LEAVE THAT THERE, PLEASE.

1359
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
>> IS THERE ANY UPDATE ON THE

1360
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
SCHOOLS THAT WERE LOCKED DOWN

1361
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
EARLIER TODAY?

1362
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
>> NO, THOSE WILL BE HANDLED BY

1363
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

1364
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THOSE TWO LOCKDOWNS IN

1365
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES HAVE

1366
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
BEEN CLEARED, YES.
>> CAN YOU TELL US IF THE

1367
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ALLEGED BUSHMASTER ASSAULT RIFLE

1368
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
IS LEGAL UNDER CONNECTICUT'S LAW

1369
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
TO POSSESS BY ANYONE?

1370
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
>> I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT
BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW.

1371
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
AS I SAID THIS MORNING, THAT

1372
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
WEAPON, FROM THE DAY IT WAS

1373
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
BUILT TO THE DAY WE SEIZED IT,

1374
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
WE WILL LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF

1375
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
IT FROM STEM TO STERN, WHERE

1376
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
IT'S BEEN, WHO'S HAD IT AND ALL

1377
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THE CLIPS, THE AMMUNITION,

1378
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ALL THE

1379
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
WEAPONS.

1380
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
>> JUST A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, A

1381
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME

1382
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SAY THERE'S NO MYSTERY HERE

1383
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
ANYMORE.
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH EFFORT BEING

1384
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
PUT INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

1385
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
AND THEY MIGHT SAY THERE WILL

1386
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
NEVER BE JUSTICE.
WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS THAT YOU'RE

1387
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
GETTING?
>> THE ANSWERS ARE FOR THE POOR

1388
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES, THE

1389
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT THAT NEED

1390
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
TO KNOW AND SEE A CLEAR PICTURE

1391
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
AS TO EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

1392
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
HERE.

1393
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AS I SAID MANY TIMES, THERE ARE

1394
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING FIRST

1395
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
RESPONDERS, INCLUDING TOWN

1396
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
RESIDENTS, INCLUDING PEOPLE
RIGHT IN THIS AUDIENCE THAT HAVE

1397
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
BROKEN HEARTS OVER THIS.

1398
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING

1399
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THAT IT TAKES TO ENSURE THAT WE

1400
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
UNCOVER EVERY BIT OF EVIDENCE,

1401
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
THAT WE ARE EXPECTING EVERY

1402
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
FACET OF IT, THAT WE CONDUCT AS

1403
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
MANY INTERVIEWS WITH EVERYONE

1404
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THAT WE NEED TO DO TO PAINT A

1405
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
CLEAR PICTURE AS TO EXACTLY HOW

1406
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
AND WHY THIS TRAGEDY OCCURRED.

1407
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
YES, MA'AM.

1408
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY THE MOTHER,

OTHER GUNS SEIZED IN HOUSE?

1411
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT, AGAIN,

1412
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
MA'AM, ANYTHING THAT WAS SEIZED

1413
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
IN THAT HOUSE WOULD BE EVIDENCE.

1414
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
AND AS FAR AS THE WOUNDS THAT

1415
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THE VICTIM SUFFERED, THE MEDICAL

1416
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
EXAMINER WAS VERY CLEAR, IT WAS

1417
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS, AND

1418
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE WENT WITH

1419
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THAT DESCRIPTION, MA'AM.

1420
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
ONE MORE QUESTION.

1421
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
YES, SIR.
>> CAN YOU SPEAK ANY -- CAN YOU

00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
ANYTHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY

1440
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
APPEARS TO BE A LACK OF SECURITY

1441
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
OR A BREACH OF SECURITY, ANY

1442
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN

1443
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
CONNECTICUT, AND I'M SURE IN

1444
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
SURROUNDING STATES AND ACROSS

1445
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THE COUNTRY WILL TREAT IT VERY,

1446
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
VERY SERIOUS.

1447
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
THIS MORNING THERE WAS A

1448
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL IN CLOSE

1449
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PROXIMITY TO ONE OF THE SCHOOLS.

1450
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
A LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT

1451
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND

1452
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
CLEARED THE MATTER.

1453
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
IT WAS NOT A THREAT, BUT IN

1454
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
DOING SO, THEY DID PUT NEARBY

1455
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SCHOOLS IN LOCKDOWN SIMPLY AS A

1456
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
PRECAUTION.
I DO KNOW THAT ACROSS THE STATE,

1457
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
THE GOVERNOR AND THE EDUCATION

1458
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
COMMISSIONER AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS

1459
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
ARE PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF

1460
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
EXTRA SECURITY.

1461
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
WE'RE SUPPORTING THE EDUCATIONAL

1462
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

1463
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE'RE CERTAINLY, AS YOU WELL

1464
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
KNOW, THE TEACHERS ARE WELL

1465
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
TRAINED.

1466
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
THE FACULTY ARE WELL TRAINED.

1467
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
ALL THE PERSONNEL IN THE SCHOOL

1468
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
ARE WELL TRAINED.

1469
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THEY PRACTICE FOR FIRE DRILLS,

1470
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
FOR EMERGENCIES.
AND BELIEVE ME, THE BLANKET OF

1471
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
SECURITY ON PUBLIC SAFETY IS
GOING TO BE STRICT IN THE STATE

1472
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
OF CONNECTICUT.

1473
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU TODAY,

1474
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000

WE WILL STAY IN CONTACT.
IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS,

WE CAN ADDRESS THEM VIA E-MAIL.

1507
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THAT WOULD BE THE SMARTEST AND

1508
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THE BEST WAY.

1509
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000

YES, SIR.

JUST SO WE HAVE SOME IDEA.

1524
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000

IT'S GOING TO TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL

SANDRA, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

WHAT THE FAMILIES AND THE

1674
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
COMMUNITY ARE GOING THROUGH AT

1675
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000

TELL US WHAT WE ARE LEARNING

1677
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
ABOUT THESE TWO LITTLE BOYS.

>> Reporter: WELL, LITTLE JACK

1679
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
PINTO, SUZANNE, WAS A BIG SPORTS

1680
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
FAN.
HE LOVED BASEBALL, BASKETBALL

1681
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
AND WRESTLING.

1682
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
HE EVEN WON HIS FIRST WRESTLING

1683
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
MATCH AND WON A MEDAL.

1684
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
AND WE'RE TOLD THAT SOME OF HIS

1685
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
TEAMMATES CAME TO HIS FUNERAL

1686
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
WEARING MEDALS AS WELL.

1687
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
BUT HIS FAVORITE SPORT WAS

1688
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
FOOTBALL.
AND HIS IDOL WAS NEW YORK

1689
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
GIANTS' RECEIVER VICTOR CRUZ.

1690
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
AND OVER THE WEEKEND DURING THE

1691
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
GAME, VICTOR CRUZ WORE A TRIBUTE

1692
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
TO PINTO ON HIS GLOVE SAYING

1693
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
"TODAY'S GAME IS FOR YOU, JACK."

1694
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
HERE'S ALSO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

1695
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
>> IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.

1696
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
OBVIOUSLY GOING IN WHEN A FAMILY

1697
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
IS FACING THAT MUCH TRAGEDY, YOU

1698
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
WANT TO BE SOMEONE THAT INSPIRES

1699
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
THEM, SOMEONE THAT CAN PUT A

1700
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
SMILE ON THEIR FACE IN A TIME

1701
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
WHEN IT'S TOUGH TO DO THAT.

1702
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
IT WAS DEFINITELY AN EMOTIONAL

1703
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
ONE GOING IN, AND WE WANTED THIS

1704
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
VICTORY.

1705
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
>> Reporter: OF COURSE, A VERY,

1706
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
VERY EMOTIONAL AND SAD DAY HERE

1707
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
IN NEWTOWN.

1708
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
JACK PINTO, ONLY 6 YEARS OLD.

1709
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
SUZANNE?
>> TELL US ABOUT HIS CLASSMATE,

1710
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
NOAH.

1711
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
>> Reporter: WELL, NOAH, HE IS

1712
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
ALSO 6 YEARS OLD.

1713
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
HE JUST TURNED 6 A MONTH AGO.

1714
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
AND HE WILL ALSO BE LAID TO REST

1715
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN.

1716
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
HERE'S WHAT HIS AUNT HAD TO SAY,

1717
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
TALKING WITH CNN FROM SEATTLE.

1718
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
>> NOAH WAS EXTREMELY LIVELY.

1719
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
HE WAS REALLY THE LIGHT OF THE

1720
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
ROOM.
HE HAD A HUGE HEART.

1721
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
AND HE WAS SO MUCH FUN.

1722
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
A LITTLE BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS, LOTS

1723
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
OF SPIRIT.

1724
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
HE LOVED PLAYING WITH ALL OF HIS

1725
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
COUSINS.

1726
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
HE LOVED HIS TWIN THE MOST OF

1727
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
ALL AND ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY

1728
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
WERE BEST FRIENDS.

1729
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
HE JUST -- YOU KNOW, THOSE BIG

1730
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
BLUE EYES.

1731
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
HE WAS A GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS BOY.

1732
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
AND HE COULD REALLY GET WHAT HE

1733
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
WANTED JUST BY BATTING THOSE

1734
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
LONG EYELASHES AND LOOKING AT

1735
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
YOU WITH THOSE BIG BLUE EYES.

1736
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
YOU REALLY COULDN'T SAY NO TO

1737
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
HIM.

1738
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
>> Reporter: LIVES CERTAINLY

1739
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
TAKEN TOO SOON.

1740
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
AND ACCORDING TO FAMILY MEMBERS

1741
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
OF NOAH, HE LOVED HIS LITTLE

1742
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
SISTER, HIS TWIN SISTER,

1743
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
SURVIVES HIM, AND FAMILY MEMBERS

1744
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
SAY THEY STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO

1745
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
EXPLAIN TO HER HOW EXACTLY HE

1746
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
PASSED AWAY.

1747
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
SUZANNE.

1748
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
>> I UNDERSTAND HIS TWIN SISTER

1749
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
WAS IN ANOTHER CLASSROOM, IS

1750
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
THAT RIGHT, THAT THEY WERE NOT

1751
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
IN THE SAME CLASS TOGETHER

1752
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
BECAUSE THEY SEPARATE TWINS.

1753
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM
TO BE IN THE SAME CLASS.

1754
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

1755
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
SHE DID SURVIVE THE HORRIFIC

1756
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
SHOOTING.

1757
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
AND OF COURSE, THAT'S SOMETHING

1758
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
A LOT OF THESE STUDENTS HERE AT

1759
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY WILL HAVE

1760
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
TO DEAL WITH.

1761
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
THEY ARE STILL GRAPPLING WITH

1762
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
FIGURING OUT WHERE TO RESUME

1763
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
CLASSES HERE IN NEWTOWN.

1764
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
TODAY ALL SCHOOLS ARE SUSPENDED.

TOMORROW MOST CLASSES WILL

BUT OF COURSE FOR THE STUDENTS

1767
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
AT SANDY HOOK, THEY WILL STILL

01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
HAVE SUSPENDED CLASSES UNTIL

1769
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
THEY CAN FIND ANOTHER LOCATION.

1770
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
SANDRA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1771
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
IT'S SUCH A LOSS.
WOLF?

1772
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
>> Reporter: IT'S A TRAGEDY

1773
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
BEYOND BELIEF OR UNDERSTANDING.

1774
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COULD

1775
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
HAVE DRIVEN A YOUNG MAN TO KILL

1776
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
HIS OWN MOTHER AND THEN GUN DOWN

1777
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
20 YOUNG CHILDREN AND 6 ADULTS?

1778
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
INEVITABLY, QUESTIONS ARE BEING

1779
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
RAISED ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD AND

1780
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
HIS FAMILY LIFE.

1781
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
OUR OWN DEBORAH FEYERICK IS HERE

1782
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
IN NEWTOWN.

1783
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
SHE'S GOT MORE ON WHAT'S GOING

1784
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
ON.
PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION.
WHAT ARE WE HEARING ABOUT, FOR

1785
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
EXAMPLE, THE COMPUTERS FOUND

1786
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
INSIDE THE HOME OF THE SHOOTER?

1787
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, WOLF, THE

1788
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
ONE THING WE ALL HAVE TO KEEP IN

1789
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
MIND IS THAT MUCH OF THE

1790
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
FORENSIC EVIDENCE AS TO WHY THIS

1791
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
HAPPENED, THE ENTIRE MOTIVE IS

1792
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
PROBABLY LOCKED SOMEWHERE IN

1793
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
THIS HOUSE.

1794
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES

1795
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
THAT POLICE CAME TO IMMEDIATELY

1796
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING.

1797
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
THEY ALLEGEDLY FOUND A COMPUTER.

1798
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT, IN FACT,

1799
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
THE COMPUTER WAS SMASHED.
THE QUESTION IS IS WHEN WAS THAT

1800
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
COMPUTER SMASHED?

1801
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
WAS IT SMASHED BEFORE THIS WHOLE

1802
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
SHOOTING SPREE BEGAN, OR WAS IT

1803
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
WHAT PROMPTED HIM?

1804
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

1805
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO BE

1806
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
LOOKING INTO.
WHILE THE STATE POLICE WOULD NOT

1807
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
CONFIRM, THEY SAID THEY DON'T

1808
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE, WHAT THEY

1809
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
DID SAY IS THAT THEY'VE GOT AN

1810
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
EXCELLENT FORENSIC TEAM THAT'S

1811
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
GOING TO LOOK INTO ELECTRONIC

1812
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
DATA.

1813
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AS FAR AS

1814
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
THEY'LL GO.
THE QUESTION IS WHY.

1815
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
FIRST OF ALL, POLICE ALSO SAY

1816
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
THERE WAS NO DIRECT CONNECTION

1817
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
WITH THE SCHOOL.
THE GUNMAN HAD NO DIRECT

1818
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
CONNECTION WITH THE NEWTOWN

1819
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
SO WHY DID HE GO THERE?

1820
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
THAT IS ONE OF THE MYSTERIES

1821
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
LOCKED IN HIS MIND.

1822
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE

1823
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
WAS SOME MOVEMENT IN THE LANZA

1824
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
FAMILY, IN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN

1825
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
THE HOME BECAUSE WE NOW FIND OUT

1826
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
THAT THE MOTHER APPARENTLY HAD

1827
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
MADE COMMENTS TO FRIENDS THAT

1828
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
SHE WAS -- THAT THIS WAS GOING

1829
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
TO BE HER LAST WINTER HERE, THAT

1830
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
SHE WAS PLANNING ON MOVING,

1831
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
GETTING AWAY FROM HERE.

1832
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
AGAIN, WHY?

1833
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
NOBODY KNOWS.

1834
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
POLICE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

1835
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
OBVIOUSLY FIND THE ANSWERS SINCE

1836
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
SHE WAS FOUND SHOT DEAD IN THE

1837
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
HEAD INSIDE THIS HOME.

1838
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
AND, OF COURSE, THE MYSTERIES

1839
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
THERE, THEY JUST SORT OF KEEP ON

1840
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
COMING, WOLF, AS EVERYBODY TRIES

1841
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
TO WORK THROUGH THEIR GRIEF AND

1842
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
BURY THE CHILDREN AND THE

1843
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
TEACHERS WHO WERE VICTIMS OF ALL

1844
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
THIS, WOLF.

1845
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
>> Reporter: DEB, INVESTIGATORS

1846
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW

1847
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
ADAM LANZA, THE SHOOTER.

1848
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

1849
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
>> Reporter: WHAT'S SO

1850
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
INTERESTING IS USUALLY AFTER A

1851
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
SHOOTING LIKE THIS, A LOT OF

1852
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
INFORMATION COMES OUT ON THE

1853
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
GUNMAN, WHY HE DID IT.

1854
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
BUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

1855
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
ABOUT HIM IS THAT APPARENTLY HE

1856
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
DID NOT GO TO THE ELEMENTARY

1857
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
SCHOOL.
HE DID GO TO SOME HIGH SCHOOLS

1858
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
HERE IN THE AREA, BUT IT SEEMS

1859
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF

1860
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
TURNOVER, THAT HE WAS GOING TO A

1861
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS HERE.

1862
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
AND AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT

1863
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
HE WENT TO, HE WAS ASSIGNED A

1864
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST BECAUSE NOT

1865
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
THAT THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT HIM

1866
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
AS A THREAT TO WORRY STUDENTS.

1867
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
IN FACT, THEY WERE MORE WORRIED

1868
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
THAT OTHER STUDENTS WOULD BE

1869
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
PICKING ON HIM.

1870
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
SO THAT'S WHY HE WAS ASSIGNED TO

1871
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
THAT.

1872
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
AGAIN, HIS DEMEANOR VERY QUIET,

1873
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
VERY SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

1874
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
ANTI-SOCIAL.

1875
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
AND YOU TALK TO SO MANY PEOPLE.

1876
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
A RELATIVE WILL SAY ADAM LANZA

1877
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
WAS A BRILLIANT KID, THAT HE WAS

1878
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
A REALLY SMART KID, BUT THEY

1879
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
CAN'T TELL YOU OTHER DETAILS

1880
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
ABOUT HIM.

1881
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
HE WAS A COMPUTER GEEK, BUT THEY

1882
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
CAN'T TELL YOU IF HE LOVED

1883
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
SPORTS.
SO DETAILS LIKE THAT ARE

1884
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
MISSING.
AND TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO

1885
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
ACTUALLY KNEW ADAM LANZA AND WHO

1886
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
CAN TALK ABOUT ADAM IN HIS LATER

1887
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
YEARS, THAT IS REALLY WHAT'S SO

1888
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
DIFFICULT.
AND THAT'S WHY INVESTIGATORS ARE

1889
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
HOPING THAT THE INFORMATION THAT

1890
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
THEY SEIZED FROM INSIDE THE

1891
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

1892
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
SEE IT, BUT THERE IS A POLICE

1893
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
OFFICER STANDING THERE AT THE

1894
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
FRONT OF THE DOOR.

1895
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
AGAIN, THIS IS STILL A CRIME

1896
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
SCENE.
THEY'RE STILL GOING THROUGH IT.

1897
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
IF THEY CAN GET A LOT OF THE

1898
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
INFORMATION FROM THE COMPUTER,

1899
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
THEN PERHAPS, WOLF, WE WILL HAVE
AN ANSWER.

1900
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
>> Reporter: A LOT OF QUESTIONS

1901
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
AND STILL ONLY A FEW ANSWERS.

1902
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
DEB FEYERICK, THANK YOU.

1903
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
THE SHOOTING HAS CERTAINLY MANY

1904
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
PARENTS WONDERING HOW TO EXPLAIN

1905
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
ALL OF THIS, THIS GREAT TRAGEDY

1906
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
TO THEIR OWN CHILDREN.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH A

1907
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
PSYCHOLOGIST ABOUT HOW TO DO

1908
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
JUST THAT AS WE CONTINUE OUR

1909
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
SPECIAL COVERAGE.

1910
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
>>> THESE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS

1911
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
ARE COMING UP ALL OVER NEWTOWN

1912
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
HERE.
YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE ARE JUST

1913
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
BRINGING TEDDY BEARS, THEY'RE

1914
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
BRINGING FLOWERS, LITTLE BELLS,

1915
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
AS YOU CAN SEE OVER THERE, EVEN

1916
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
LEGOS TO REMEMBER THE VICTIMS

1917
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
FROM NEWTOWN, WHAT'S GOING ON.

1918
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
ASHLEIGH BANFIELD IS ALSO

1919
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
REMEMBERING WHAT'S GOING ON.

1920
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
SHE HAS A CLOSER LOOK AT ONE OF

1921
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
THESE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS NEAR A

1922
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
SCHOOL.

1923
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
>> Reporter: IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG

1924
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
BEFORE THIS COMMUNITY BEGAN TO

1925
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
START BRINGING CHRISTMAS TREES

1926
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
TO WHAT'S BECOME A MAKESHIFT

1927
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
MEMORIAL NOT FAR FROM THE

1928
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
SCHOOL.
AND THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 OF

1929
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
THESE DECORATED TREES.

1930
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
EACH ONE OF THEM WITH STUFFED

1931
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
ANIMALS AND CANDY CANES AND BOWS

1932
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
AND NAMES AND FLOWERS.

1933
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
WHAT YOU SEE MOSTLY IS THE

1934
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
REPETITION OF 20, AT LEAST 20,

1935
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
WHETHER IT'S CANDLES THAT ARE

1936
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
BROUGHT OUT, THEY'RE OUT OUT IN

1937
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
COLLECTIONS OF 20 TO REPRESENT

1938
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
THESE VICTIMS.

1939
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
YOU ALSO SEE THE FLOWERS THAT

1940
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT FROM LOCAL

1941
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
FLORISTS.
IT'S JUST REMARKABLE THAT THE

1942
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
SHEER NUMBER OF TEDDY BEARS THAT

1943
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
ARE HERE AND STUFFED ANIMALS.

1944
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
IF YOU NOTICE UP HERE, ONE OF

1945
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
THE PERMANENT PILLARS SOMEONE

1946
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
HAS BROUGHT OUT ANGEL WINGS.

1947
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
AND THERE'S A SIGN BELOW SAYING

1948
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
"WE PROMISE TO NEVER FORGET

1949
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
YOU."
JUST MOVING A LITTLE BIT FARTHER

1950
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
ON, YOU SEE THE REAL COLLECTION

1951
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
OF WHERE THIS MAKESHIFT MEMORIAL

1952
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
STARTED.
THERE'S A TENT NOW, BUT

1953
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
EVERYTHING IS SO WET FROM THE

1954
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
RAIN.

1955
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
THERE'S JUST HUNDREDS OF TEDDY

1956
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
BEARS AND FLOWERS AND MESSAGES

1957
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
AND CANDLES.

1958
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
THE ONES THAT ARE STILL BURNING

1959
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
ARE NOW UNDER THE TENT.

1960
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
AND IF YOU LOOK UP HERE, YOU'LL

1961
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
SEE WHY.

1962
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
THIS IS THE PERMANENT SIGN FOR
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

1963
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
IT'S JUST BEYOND HERE.

1964
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
>> CHILDREN IN NEWTOWN AND

1965
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
CITIES NEARBY ARE STILL OFF OF

1966
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
SCHOOL TODAY, BUT FOR THE REST

1967
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
OF THE COUNTRY, SCHOOL BELLS

1968
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
RANG THIS MORNING.

1969
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
PARENTS AND TEACHERS STILL

1970
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
STRUGGLING, PROBABLY GOING TO

1971
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
STRUGGLE FOR A WHILE NOW.

1972
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
HOW DO THEY EXPLAIN THIS MASS

1973
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
SHOOTING AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1974
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS COULD

1975
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
EVEN HAPPEN AT THEIR OWN CHILD'S

1976
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
SCHOOL.
HERE'S WHAT ONE DAD SAID ON

1977
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
FRIDAY.

1978
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
>> MY KIDS ARE ALREADY ASKING,

1979
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN

1980
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
AGAIN?

1981
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONLY A WEEK AGO

1982
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

1983
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
TYPE OF SITUATION.

1984
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
AND I SAID THE CHANCES OF IT

1985
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
HAPPENING ARE 1 IN A ZILLION AT

1986
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
SANDY HOOK.

1987
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT.

1988
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
>> I'M JOINED AGAIN FROM NEW

1989
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
YORK BY CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST

1990
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
JEFF GARDERE.

1991
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
AND JEFF, WE MIGHT HAVE TO

1992
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
INTERRUPT YOU IF THE WHITE HOUSE

1993
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
BRIEFING STARTS.

1994
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
>> SURE.
>> TO GO TO THAT.

1995
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S TALK

1996
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
ABOUT THIS.

1997
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1998
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
THERE ARE KIDS ALL OVER THE

1999
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
COUNTRY, THEY'RE GETTING BITS

2000
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
AND PIECES OF THIS STORY.

2001
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
THEY'RE PROBABLY AFRAID.

2002
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
THEY'RE PROBABLY VERY UPSET.

2003
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
HOW SHOULD PARENTS COMMUNICATE

2004
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
AND REASSURE THEM THAT IT'S OKAY

2005
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
TO GO TO SCHOOL?

2006
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
>> WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST,

2007
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
SUZANNE, WE'VE GOT TO LET THE

2008
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
KIDS KNOW THAT YES, THEY ARE

2009
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
SAFE.

2010
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN LIFE

2011
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
AT ALL.

2012
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
BUT THEY ARE SAFE IN THEIR

2013
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
SCHOOLS.
AND THE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT

2014
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
IS TAKING THEM TO SCHOOL,

2015
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
SPENDING SOME TIME WITH THEM AND

2016
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
CERTAINLY THE TEACHERS HAVE TO

2017
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
SPEND THE TIME HUGGING THEM AND

2018
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
TALKING TO THEM AND REASSURING

2019
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
THEM IN ADDITION, OF COURSE, TO

2020
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
THEIR LEARNING THEIR LESSONS OF

2021
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
THE DAY.

2022
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
SECONDLY, I JUST THINK IT'S

2023
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
IMPORTANT THAT WE LISTEN TO OUR

2024
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
CHILDREN.
IT'S NOT ABOUT LECTURING TO

2025
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
THEM, BUT KNOWING WHERE THEY

2026
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
ARE, ASKING THEM, JUST THROWING

2027
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
OUT LITTLE BITS OF INFORMATION

2028
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
AND TRY TO PULL THEM IN AND SEE

2029
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
WHERE THEY ARE COMING FROM.

2030
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE, WHAT THE

2031
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
ANXIETY OR THE FEAR MAY BE.

2032
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
>> JEFF, SHOULD THERE BE A PLAN?

2033
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
SHOULD YOU ARM YOUR CHILD WITH A

2034
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
LITTLE EMERGENCY PLAN TO HELP

2035
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
REASSURE THEM IF THERE IS A

2036
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
SITUATION THAT IS AS TRAGIC AS

2037
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
THAT, OR IF THEY FEEL THREATENED

2038
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
IN SOME WAY LIKE THEY USED TO

2039
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
TEACH US NOT TO TALK TO

2040
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
STRANGERS AND THAT KIND OF

2041
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
THING?
>> SURE.
>> WHAT CAN YOU DO IN A

2042
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
PRACTICAL SENSE?
>> SUZANNE, I REALLY LIKE THAT

2043
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
EMPOWERMENT IDEA, AND THAT'S

2044
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
WHAT I'M CALLING IT.

2045
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE OPPOSITE OF

2046
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
ANXIETY IS ACTION.

2047
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
AND SO BY GIVING THEM A PLAN, BY

2048
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
GIVING THEM SOME INFORMATION ON

2049
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
A PIECE OF PAPER WHO TO CALL,

2050
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
WHERE THEY SHOULD GO, WHAT ARE

2051
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
THE SAFE HAVENS, ALL OF THOSE

2052
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
THINGS TAKE A LOT OF THAT

2053
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL ENERGY AWAY FROM

2054
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
WORRYING AND MORE TOWARDS BEING

2055
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
EMPOWERED AND DOING SOMETHING
POSITIVE.

2056
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR CHILD

2057
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
IS NOT DOING WELL WITH THIS?

2058
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
>> WELL, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

2059
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
TELL BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU AS

2060
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
A FATHER OF MANY CHILDREN AND

2061
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN, WHEN I

2062
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
ASKED THEM ABOUT IT, THEY DIDN'T

2063
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
REALLY WANT TO TALK.

2064
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
THEY WERE VERY SILENT ABOUT IT.

2065
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
SUFFERING SILENTLY.

2066
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

2067
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
REALIZE IT'S NOT ABOUT THEIR

2068
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
BEING SO RESILIENT IF THEY DON'T

2069
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
WANT TO TALK.

2070
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
IT SIMPLY IS THAT THEY ARE

2071
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
PROCESSING IT AND THEREFORE WE

2072
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
CAN DO THINGS LIKE GET THEM TO

2073
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
DRAW AND PLAY.

2074
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
BUT WE'LL ALSO SEE THEY'LL TRY

2075
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
TO AVOID SCHOOL.

2076
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF, I'M SORRY, I

2077
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
HAVE TO INTERRUPT.

2078
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
WE HAVE JAY CARNEY AT THE WHITE

2079
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
HOUSE SPEAKING ON THIS.
LET'S LISTEN IN.

2080
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
>> -- USING THE POWER OF HIS

2081
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
OFFICE TO PUSH FOR TIGHTER GUN

2082
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
CONTROL?

2083
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
>> I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

2084
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE LAST NIGHT

2085
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
AT THE VIGIL IN NEWTOWN.

2086
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
AND HE SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT

2087
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
THE FAMILIES OF NEWTOWN ARE NOT

2088
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
ALONE.

2089
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
AND HE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT

2090
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
THAT THE KIND OF VIOLENCE THAT

2091
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
OCCURRED IN NEWTOWN OCCURS TOO

2092
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
OFTEN.

2093
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
IN THIS COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH WHAT

2094
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
WE SAW IN NEWTOWN WAS

2095
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
PARTICULARLY HORRIFIC.

2096
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
HE SAID THAT IN THE COMING

2097
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
WEEKS, HE WOULD USE THE POWER OF

2098
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
HIS OFFICE TO ENGAGE THE

2099
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LAWMAKERS,

2100
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, MENTAL HEALTH

2101
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
EXPERTS, EDUCATORS AND OTHERS IN

2102
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
AN EFFORT TO TRY TO PREVENT

2103
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
THESE KINDS OF TERRIBLE

2104
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
TRAGEDIES FROM HAPPENING IN THE

2105
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
FUTURE.

2106
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM THAT WILL

2107
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
REQUIRE A COMPLEX SOLUTION.

2108
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
NO SINGLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION,

2109
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
NO SINGLE ACTION WILL FULLY

2110
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

2111
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
SO I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

2112
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
AGENDA TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU TODAY.

2113
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I WOULD SIMPLY POINT YOU TO WHAT

2114
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID LAST NIGHT

2115
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
ABOUT MOVING FORWARD IN COMING

2116
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
WEEKS.

2117
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
AND I WOULD LOOK FOR HIM TO DO

2118
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
THAT.
>> AND THE COMPREHENSIVE

2119
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
SOLUTION, DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR

2120
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
AND ACCURATE TO SAY THAT

2121
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE, GUN

2122
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
CONTROL WOULD HAVE TO BE PART OF
IT?

2123
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
>> I THINK THAT IT'S PART OF IT,

2124
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
BUT IT IS FAR FROM ALL OF IT.

2125
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
AND AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT

2126
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
HAS TAKEN POSITIONS ON

2127
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
COMMON-SENSE MEASURES THAT HE

2128
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
BELIEVES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HELP

2129
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, BUT HE

2130
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
MADE CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE

2131
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
DONE, THAT WE AS A NATION HAVE

2132
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
NOT DONE ENOUGH, CLEARLY, TO

2133
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
FULFILL OUR NUMBER ONE

2134
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
OBLIGATION, WHICH IS TO PROTECT

2135
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
OUR CHILDREN.

2136
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
>> ONE MORE ON THIS.

2137
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN THESE

2138
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
HORRIFIC MOMENTS COME AND GO AND

2139
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
THAT THE DEBATE ABOUT GUN

2140
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
SAFETY, CHILDREN'S SAFETY, GOES

2141
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
WITH IT.

2142
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT HE

2143
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
NEEDS TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS, GET

2144
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
THIS CONVERSATION GOING AND SEE

2145
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
SOME ACTION IN THE SHORT TERM,

2146
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
OR DOES HE FEEL LIKE HE CAN GET

2147
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
THROUGH THE FISCAL CLIFF,

2148
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
IMMIGRATION AND THERE'S NOW A
MINDSET AND A WILL TO GET THIS

2149
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
DONE MONTHS DOWN THE LINE?

2150
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIME

2151
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
LINE FOR YOU FOR WHAT THE

2152
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
PRESIDENT WILL DO MOVING

2153
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
FORWARD.
I WOULD SIMPLY REFER YOU TO HIS

2154
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
REMARKS LAST NIGHT WHEN HE

2155
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
TALKED ABOUT THE ACTION HE HOPED

2156
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
TO TAKE TO ENGAGE THE AMERICAN

2157
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
PEOPLE IN THE COMING WEEKS.

2158
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED AT

2159
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAS

2160
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
CLEARLY SHOCKED THE ENTIRE

2161
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
NATION.

2162
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
AND HAS LAID BARE THE NECESSITY

2163
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
OF EVALUATING THE VARIOUS THINGS

2164
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
THAT WE CAN AND MUST DO AS A

2165
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
NATION TO TRY TO BETTER PRODUCT

2166
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
OUR CHILDREN.

2167
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
>> QUICKLY ON FISCAL CLIFF, THE

2168
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
PRESIDENT SAID TO THE BUSINESS

2169
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
ROUNDTABLE RECENTLY THAT

2170
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
REPUBLICANS NEED TO REACH WHAT

2171
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
HE CALLED A CONCEPTUAL

2172
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
BREAKTHROUGH ON RATES, TAX RATES

2173
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
GOING UP, AND THEN ONCE THAT

2174
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
HAPPENS, THAT YOU HAVE TO COME

2175
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
TOGETHER PRETTY QUICKLY.

2176
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
DOES HE FEEL HE HAS HA NOW THAT

2177
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, HE IS TALKING

2178
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
ABOUT RATES IN THE CONVERSATION?

2179
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
>> I WON'T COMMENT ON SPECIFIC

2180
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
REPORTED PROPOSALS OR

2181
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
COUNTERPROPOSALS ON INTERNAL

2182
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER OR THE

2183
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND THE

2184
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
SPEAKER'S TEAM OR WITH OTHER

2185
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
MEMBERS OF LEADERSHIP.

2186
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
THE PRESIDENT'S INSISTENCE THAT

2187
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
RATES NEED TO GO UP ON THE TOP

2188
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,000
2% WAS BASED ON AN ECONOMIC

2189
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
REALITY, WHICH IS THAT IN ORDER

2190
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
TO ACHIEVE A BROAD DEFICIT

2191
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
REDUCTION PACKAGE THAT PUTS OUR

2192
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
ECONOMY ON A SUSTAINABLE FISCAL

2193
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
PATH IN THE FUTURE, A CERTAIN

2194
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
LEVEL OF REVENUE GLEANED FROM

2195
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
THE WEALTHY HAS TO BE MET.

2196
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT WAS

2197
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
THROUGH, IN PART, RATES RISING.

2198
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
THAT REMAINS HIS POSITION.

2199
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
SO WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE

2200
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
ELECTION A CHANGE IN TONE AND IN

2201
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
SOME CASES A CHANGE IN POSITION

2202
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
FROM DIFFERENT ROEPUBLICANS

2203
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
INCLUDING ELECTED REPUBLICANS ON

2204
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
THE ISSUE OF FIRST REVENUE AND

2205
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
THEN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT RATES

2206
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
HAVE TO GO UP.

2207
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
BUT THUS FAR, THE PRESIDENT'S

2208
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
PROPOSAL IS THE ONLY PROPOSAL

2209
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT ACHIEVES

2210
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
THE BALANCE THAT'S SO NECESSARY.

2211
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
AND THE BALANCE IS IMPORTANT

2212
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
BECAUSE A PLAN THAT DOES NOT

2213
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
HAVE IT PUTS UNDULY THE BURDEN

2214
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
ON SENIOR CITIZENS.

2215
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
THROUGH -- OR ON MIDDLE-CLASS

2216
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
AMERICANS OR ON PARENTS WITH

2217
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
DISABLED CHILDREN.

2218
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

2219
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
BALANCE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IN

2220
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY

2221
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
THAT PROTECTS THE MIDDLE CLASS,

2222
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
WE NEED TO HAVE THE PACKAGE

2223
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
INCLUDE THE KIND OF REVENUE THAT

2224
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT.

2225
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
>> LAST QUESTION.

2226
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON

2227
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
TAXES GOING UP ON HOUSEHOLDS

2228
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
OVER $250,000.

2229
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
HE WAS VERY CLEAR AND SPECIFIC

2230
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
ABOUT THAT.

2231
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
WHEN YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT THAT

2232
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
THRESHOLD OVER THE SUMMER, YOU

2233
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
SAID THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION

2234
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR A LONG,

2235
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
LONG TIME.

2236
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
IT HAS NOT CHANGED AND IT WILL

2237
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
NOT CHANGE.

2238
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK

2239
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
ABOUT THE BOEHNER PROPOSAL OF $1

2240
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
MILLION, BUT I'M JUST ASKING

2241
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S STANCE.

2242
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
IS IT STILL AND WILL REMAIN THAT

2243
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
$250,000 IS THE THRESHOLD?

2244
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
>> WELL, I WILL SAY WHAT I'VE

2245
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
SAID MANY TIMES FROM HERE IN

2246
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS, WHICH

2247
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
IS THAT THE ONLY PLAN THAT WE

2248
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
HAVE SEEN THAT ACHIEVES THE SIZE

2249
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
AND THE BALANCE THAT'S REQUIRED

2250
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
FOR SUSTAINABLE -- FOR LONG-TERM

2251
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
DEFICIT REDUCTION AND PUTTING

2252
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
OUR ECONOMY ON A SUSTAINABLE

2253
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
FISCAL PATH IS THE PRESIDENT'S.

2254
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
AND AN ELEMENT -- IMPORTANT

2255
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
ELEMENT OF THAT ON THE REVENUE

2256
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
SIDE IS ALLOWING CURRENT LAW,

2257
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
WHEN IT COMES TO THE TOP 2%, TO

2258
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
REMAIN IN PLACE, WHICH WOULD SEE

2259
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
RATES ON THOSE WEALTHY AMERICANS

2260
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
RISE EVEN AS WE EXTEND AND IN

2261
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
THE PRESIDENT'S MIND MAKE

2262
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
PERMANENT TAX CUTS FOR 98% OF

2263
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FOR THE

2264
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
OTHER 98% OF THE AMERICAN

2265
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
PEOPLE.

2266
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION.
AND AGAIN, IT'S NOT, AS I'VE

2267
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
SAID REPEATEDLY, HIS POSITION IS

2268
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
NOT BASED ON THE NOTION THAT

2269
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
THESE RATES HAVE TO GO UP

2270
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
BECAUSE THAT'S GOOD IN AND OF

2271
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
ITSELF.

2272
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
IT'S BASED ON THE NECESSITY OF

2273
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
HAVING ENOUGH REVENUE --

2274
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
>> PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY

2275
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
WEIGHING IN ON BOTH ISSUES HERE,

2276
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000

FISCAL CLIFF, THE NEGOTIATIONS

2278
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000

PRESIDENT AND HOUSE SPEAKER

TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO

01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
DISCUSS IT.
JAY CARNEY SAYING THAT THERE IS

2283

SOME ROOM, SOME WIGGLE ROOM, IF

2284

MAKING MORE THAN $1 MILLION, BUT

2289
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
NOT LESS THAN THAT.

2290
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
AND ALSO WEIGHING IN AS WELL ON

2291
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000

SCHOOL SHOOTING, THE MASSACRE

2293
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
THERE, SAYING MORE MUST BE DONE.

2294
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON HOW

2295
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO MOVE

2296
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000

01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
OF CONGRESS WHO ARE NOW

2336
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
PROPOSING NEW BILLS.

2337
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
THESE ARE THE TYPE OF GUNS

2338
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
POLICE SAY 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

2339
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
LANZA HAD ON HIM WHEN HE

2340
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
ATTACKED SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

2341
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
SCHOOL ON FRIDAY.

2342
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
POLICE SAY LANZA USED A

2343
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUN LIKE THE ONE

2344
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO

2345
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
FIRE MULTIPLE MAGAZINES, EACH

2346
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
CONTAINING 30 BULLETS.

2347
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORK

2348
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
TIMES," THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF

2349
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
ASSAULT RIFLE USED IN THE OREGON

2350
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
MALL SHOOTING AND THE COLORADO

2351
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
THEATER KILLINGS.

2352
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
VAN JONES IS A CNN CONTRIBUTOR,

2353
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
FORMER SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE

2354
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
PRESIDENT.
AND VAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2355
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I KNOW YOU'RE WEIGHING IN ON

2356
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
THIS.
YOU SENT OUT A LOT OF TWEETS.

2357
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
YOU'VE GOT A CONSERVATIVE

2358
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
DEMOCRAT WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR

2359
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
JOE MANCHIN TODAY WHO SAYS LOOK,

2360
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
THERE NEEDS TO BE A DISCUSSION,

2361
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
A SERIOUS DISCUSSION, ABOUT

2362
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED

2363
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
ASSAULT-TYPE WEAPONS ON THE

2364
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
STREET OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY

2365
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
SHOULD BE BANNED.

2366
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOT A

2367
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
GROUP -- THE MICHIGAN COALITION

2368
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
FOR RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS

2369
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
ARGUING THAT ACTUALLY HAVING A

2370
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
GUN SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES.

2371
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS.

2372
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
>> THE SHOOTER IN THE MALL IN

2373
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
OREGON WAS CONFRONTED BY A

2374
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
LEGALLY ARMED CITIZEN WHO

2375
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
POINTED HIS GUN AT THE SHOOTER

2376
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
AND THEN DECIDED NOT TO SQUEEZE

2377
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
THE TRIGGER BECAUSE HE WAS

2378
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
AFRAID OF MISSING AND HITTING

2379
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
BYSTANDERS.

2380
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
HE WAS ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY.

2381
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
AND THE NEXT SHOT THAT THAT

2382
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
SHOOTER FIRED THAT THE KILLER

2383
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
FIRED WAS ON HIMSELF AFTER HE

2384
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
WAS CONFRONTED WITH AN ARMED

2385
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
CITIZEN.
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE EXAMPLE

2386
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
OF A RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER USING

2387
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
A GUN TO SAVE LIVES.

2388
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
>> VAN, WHERE DO YOU FUALL ON

2389
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
THIS?

2390
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE CASE ON
BOTH SIDES.

2391
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
ON ONE HAND, IT IS A VERY

2392
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
DANGEROUS SITUATION TO HAVE

2393
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
PEOPLE ARMED.

2394
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT DOES SAVE

2395
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
LIVES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

2396
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY IS

2397
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL

2398
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE UP ALL THEIR

2399
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
G

2400
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
GUNS, BUT PEOPLE ARE TIRED NOW.

2401
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
WE'RE TIRED -- IT'S NOT JUST

2402
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
THESE CHILDREN, THERE ARE

2403
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
FUNERALS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY

2404
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
EVERY DAY.
WE'RE TIRED TO GOING TO FUNERALS

2405
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
IN CHICAGO.

2406
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
WE'RE TIRED OF GOING TO FUNERALS

2407
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
IN OAKLAND.

2408
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
WE'RE TIRED OF SEEING YOUNG

2409
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
PEOPLE IN CASKETS AND OLD FOLKS

2410
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
LIKE MYSELF SITTING UP IN THE

2411
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
PEWS.
PEOPLE ARE TIRED.

2412
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
AND A MAJORITY OF THE NRA

2413
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
MEMBERSHIP, NOT THE LEADERSHIP,

2414
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
NOT THE PEOPLE WHO JUMP ON

2415
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
TELEVISION, BUT EVEN THE

2416
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
MAJORITY OF THE NRA MEMBERSHIP

2417
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
SAYS COMMON SENSE SAYS YOU DON'T

2418
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
NEED A 100-CLIP -- THESE

2419
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
MEGACLIPS FOR PEOPLE TO GO

2420
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
HUNTING.

2421
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
WE CAN DO SOMETHING NOW.

2422
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
IN AUSTRALIA, PEOPLE KEEP

2423
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
SAYING, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING

2424
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
ABOUT THIS, IT WILL HAPPEN

2425
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
ANYWAY.

2426
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
BUT IN AUSTRALIA, WHEN THEY HAD

2427
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
A HAS KERR THAT WAS HORRIBLE,

2428
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
THE GOVERNMENT SAID ENOUGH IS

2429
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
ENOUGH.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE

2430
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONS.
WE'LL HAVE A BUYBACK.

2431
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES FELL BY

2432
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
HALF IN AUS TRAIL WHICH IS ALSO

2433
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
A DEMOCRACY.

2434
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
SO PEOPLE ARE TIRED.

2435
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'M SORRY, GO AHEAD.

2436
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
>> LET ME INTERRUPT IF I MAY.

2437
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE WHITE

2438
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
HOUSE, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

2439
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
WHITE HOUSE IS?

2440
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
BECAUSE WE KNOW AFTER THE GABBY

2441
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
GIFFORDS SHOOTING IN 2011, THE

2442
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DREW UP PLANS

2443
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
AND STEPS.

2444
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
THEY WANTED TO EXPAND BACKGROUND

2445
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
CHECKS SO THAT THE GUNS WOULD

2446
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
NOT FALL IN THE HANDS OF

2447
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
MENTALLY ILL FOLKS OR CRIMINALS.

2448
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
THEY SCRAP IT HAD DURING THE

2449
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
CAMPAIGN.

2450
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
IT WAS JUST TOO HOT OF AN ISSUE.

2451
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE WHITE HOUSE

2452
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
TO DO NOW?

2453
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
>> WELL, WE'VE ALL BEEN TOO
COWARDLY.

2454
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I'VE BEEN ON YOUR SHOW MANY

2455
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
TIMES.
I'VE NEVER MENTIONED THIS IN

2456
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
PUBLIC.
ALL OF US HAVE BEEN TOO

2457
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
COWARDLY, REPUBLICANS,

2458
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
DEMOCRATS, GUN OWNERS, EVERYONE,

2459
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
WE BEND TOO COWARDLY.

2460
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO NOW SAY WE

2461
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
CANNOT HAVE THIS BECOME THE NEW

2462
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
NORMAL.
WE CANNOT ADAPT TO ABSURDITY.

2463
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
LET'S LOOK WHERE THE CHON GROUND

2464
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
IS.
FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S GOOD NEWS.

2465
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE

2466
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
NOW SAYING THAT HEALTH CARE IS

2467
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
VERY IMPORTANT.

2468
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT

2469
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
DISCUSSION.
LET'S USE THAT TO PUSH FORWARD

2470
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
MORE SUPPORT FOR HEALTH CARE.

2471
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
YOU'VE GOT REPUBLICANS AND

2472
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
DEMOCRATS SAYING WE DON'T WANT

2473
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
THESE MILITARY-STYLE MEGACLIPS

2474
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
OUT THERE.
LET'S MOVE ON THAT.

2475
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
THE PRESIDENT RAN IN 2008 ON

2476
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
PUTTING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

2477
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
BACK IN PLACE.

2478
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
LET'S AT LEAST GO BACK TO THE

2479
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
COMMON SENSE THAT WE HAD BEFORE.

2480
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

2481
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
SOMETHING, BUT THE IDEA THAT THE

2482
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
LEADERSHIP, NOT THE MEMBERS OF

2483
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
THE NRA, I'M A SOUTHERNER.

2484
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND

2485
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
AMENDMENT.
BUT THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE

2486
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
NRA CAN'T HAVE ITS DESIRES HEARD

2487
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
BECAUSE OF SOME GUN EXTREMISTS,

2488
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

2489
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
>> AND VAN, DO YOU THINK THE

2490
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
PRESIDENT SHOULD USE EXECUTIVE

2491
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
ORDER TO GET SOME THINGS DONE

2492
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
HERE, TO PUSH SOME THINGS
THROUGH, TO FORCE IT THROUGH?

2493
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
>> WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD DO

2494
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN DO.

2495
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

2496
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
JUSTICE SHOULD BE MUCH TOUGHER

2497
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
ON PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED

2498
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
TO BE GETTING THESE GUNS, WHO

2499
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
ARE TRYING TO GET THESE GUNS.

2500
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
BUT WE DO NEED TO HAVE CONGRESS

2501
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
TAKE ACTION.

2502
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
AND I'M SO PROUD OF SENATOR

2503
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
MANCHIN, SENATOR FEINSTEIN FOR

2504
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE, AND

2505
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS COULD

2506
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
BE UNITED ON THIS NOW.

2507
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
>> ALL RIGHT, VAN JONES, THANK

2508
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
YOU.
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER

2509
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT.

2510
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
WE'LL TALK TO OREGON STATE

2511
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS RICHARDSON

2512
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
WHO IS CALLING FOR SCHOOLS TO

2513
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
