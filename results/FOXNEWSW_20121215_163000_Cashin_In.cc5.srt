THEY TRICKED THEIR CLASS MATES

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
AND TEACHERS AND USED A FIRE

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
ALARM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM TO

189
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
A FENCED AREA.

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THEY OPEN HAPPENED FIRE AND

191
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THE DOORS LOCKED AND THE KIDS

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
COULDN'T GET BACK IN.

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THEY KILLED FIVE AND WOUNDED

194
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
10.
ONE OF THE FIVE KILLED WAS A

195
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
TEACHER AND THE QUESTION IS,

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
HOW DO YOU DOLE WITH AN 11

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
YEAR OLD WHO KILLED WITH

198
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
SOMEONE?
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYONE

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THAT WE NEELEDED TO CENTER A

200
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
LAW THAT SAID IT WAS WRONG FOR

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
AN 11 YEAR OLD TO COMMIT MASS

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
MURDER.

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
>> THEY WERE HELD UNDER

204
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
ARKANSAS LAW UNDER THE AGE OF

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
18.

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
AND WOULDN'T HAVE CRIMINAL

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
REARS.

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
AFTER 21 THEY WERE FREE.

209
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE OFTEN

210
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
FACE, HOW COME WE DIDN'T HAVE

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
A LAW.

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
YOU CAN'T HAVA A LAW TO

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
PREDICT.

214
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
WE DO HAVE A LAW.

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
THOU SMALT NOT KILL.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION IS

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NEVER GOING TO BE THERE.

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
IF PEOPLE SAPE I HOPE WE CAN

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
PASS LAW.

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
WE CAN AND IT IS IT A REACTION

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND THEN MANAGE ELSE WILL

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HAPPEN AND WE'LL SAY YET WE

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
HAVE MORE LAWS.

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE AND

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THAT IS THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION

226
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
OF WHO WE ARE AS A CULTURE AND

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
AS A PEOPLE.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THERE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER TO

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WE'LL TALK ABOUT GUNS TO

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
ASBERGERS AND A WHOLE OF

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE A PART

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
OF THE CONVERSATION .

233
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
AND IF ANYBODY IS LOOKING FOR

234
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
MAGIB OR SIMPLE THEY ARE

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
LOOKING IN VAIP .

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
>> RUDY GULIANI SAID THERE IS

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
NO ONE SOLUTION .

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
NNO, THERE IS NOT.

239
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
>> IT IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM?

240
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> IT IS IT.

241
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
DISSDISMISS THAT.

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AND I SAID IT EARLIER ON FOX

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
AND FRIENDS.

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
JOHN, KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL AT

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MY SCHOOL AND WE HAD GUNS IN

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THE VEHICLES AND GUN RACKS

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
VISIBLE.

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AND GUNS ON THE SCHOOL PARKING

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
LOT.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE HUNTED BEFORE

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AND AFTER SCHOOL.

253
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
PART OF THE CULTURE, BUT IT

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WAS NOT PART OF THE CULTURE TO

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
KILL EACH OTHER ON THE CAMPUS

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
UMP.

257
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THE GUNS WERE THERE.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AND THE MIPPED SET HAS TO GET

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000

TO THE FAMILIES OF THE KIDS.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORFS.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
MY EXPERIENCE 30 YEARS AGO IS

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A ONE.

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
MORE YOU HUG PEOPLE AND GET

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
AND SHED REAL TEARS WITH THEM.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN THE

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
PODIUM WAS THE MOST POWERFUL

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
THING HE COULD HAVE DONE .

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
HE SHED TEARS AND GO TO THE

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000

FOX NEWS AHEAD.

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Sometimes what we suffer from

292
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Is bigger than we think ...
like the flu.

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There's something
that works differently

296
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

297
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

298
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

299
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

nursing. have serious
health conditions,

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
or take other medicines.

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

308
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Children and adolescents in

309

increased risk
of seizures, confusion

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or abnormal behavior.

311
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The most common
side effects are

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The flu comes on fast,

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so ask your
doctor about TAMIFLU.

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Prescription for flu.

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
AND WE DO HAVE MORE CARS

373
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000

THERE WAS A SMALL DROP AND

380
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
RUSHED THID CANS IN THE BATH

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
ROM AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

382
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
AND THEY TOLD THE CHILDREN

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THAT IT WAS HAMMERING.

384
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
AND TRIED TO CIPE THEM CALM.

385
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW, BECAUSE

386
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000

I KNOW, IS THALT POLICE CAME

389
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND THEY WERE KNOCKING ON THE

390
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
DOOR TO BE LET OUT OF THE

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
CLASSROOM AND WHEN THEY WERE.

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
SHE HAD SEEN GLASS AND BLOOD.

393
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
ONE CHILD RECOVERED IN BLOOD

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
BUT THAT CHOILED IS SAFE MUCH

395
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
>> WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE

396
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY

397
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
PLETES TOLD THEM TO CLOSE

398
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THEIR EYES.

399
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
IT WAS A SENSITIVE SCENE.

400
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AND SHE SAID SHE HEARD GUN

401
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
SHOTS AND WHAT SHE TOLD ME WAS

402
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
IN THE BEGINNING.

403
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE INTERCOM CAME ON AND SHE

404
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
HEARD A SCREAM ON THE INTERCOM

405
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
AND IT WENT IMMEDIATELY OFF.

406
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
AND I AM NOT SURE WITH THE

407
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
SPECTACULARS AND HOW THE

408
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000

IT IS IT NOT HEADACHING SENSE.

412
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
IT IS SENSELESS.
