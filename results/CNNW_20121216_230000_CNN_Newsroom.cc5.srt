1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND FAITHS

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
AND RELIGION ARE PAUSING TO

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
REMEMBER -- PAUSING TO REMEMBER,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
REFLECT, AND GRIEVE TOGETHER.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
IN THE NEXT HOUR, WE'RE GOING TO

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
HAVE THIS INTERFAITH SERVICE IN

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
THE HIGH SCHOOL JUST OVER MY

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
SHOULDER, WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
WILL BE GATHERED.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
HUNDREDS HAVE ALREADY LINED UP.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
ALREADY THE HALL INSIDE IS

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
NEARLY FULL.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I CAN SEE HUNDREDS MORE STILL

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
LINED UP IN THE RAIN AND THE

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
COLD HOPING TO GET IN, HOPING TO

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
JUST BE TOGETHER.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
WE'VE SEEN THAT SO MUCH THE LAST

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
DAY OR SO, PEOPLE JUST WANTING

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
TO BE HERE AND BE TOGETHER.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
PEOPLE COME FROM ALL PARTS OF

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
CONNECTICUT JUST TO COME AND BE

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
HERE AND WITNESS WHAT'S

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
HAPPENING HERE AND DROP OFF SOME

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
FLOWERS OR A TEDDY BEAR OR A TOY

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
OR SOMETHING, LEAVE A

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
REMEMBRANCE AND PAUSE AND

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
REFLECT.
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD ARE

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
DOING THE SAME.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'M JOINED BY MANY OF OUR

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
COLLEAGUES, OUR CORRESPONDENTS

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
ALL THROUGHOUT THIS TOWN

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
COVERING THE VARIETY OF

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
DIFFERENT MEMORIALS THAT ARE

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
TAKING PLACE, AND JOINED ALSO

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
RIGHT NOW BY WOLF BLITZER.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
WOLF, I KNOW YOU TALKED TO TWO

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
RELIGIOUS LEADERS ABOUT THE

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
SHOOTING.
I TALKED TO A NUMBER LAST NIGHT,

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A RABBI AND A REVEREND.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
YOU TALKED TO A LOCAL RABBI AND

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A REVEREND AS WELL.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
BOTH OF THEM WILL BE AT THAT

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
SERVICE TONIGHT.
>> YES, THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THERE TONIGHT.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEADING THE

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
SERVICE.
AND I HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO THE

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
CHURCH YESTERDAY AND HAD A GOOD

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT GOD AND HOW

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THESE HORRIBLE TRAGEDIES CAN

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
HAPPEN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS, AND

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THE CLERGY, NO MATTER HOW SMART,

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL, NO

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
MATTER HOW ASTUTE CERTAINLY CAN

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
COMFO

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
COMFORT.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
BOTH THE RABBI AND THE MINISTER,

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THEY WERE IN THE FIREHOUSE WHEN

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THE FAMILIES OF THE 20 KIDS WERE

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
TOLD THAT THEIR LITTLE BOY, OR

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
THEIR LITTLE GIRL, 6-YEAR-OLD OR

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
7-YEAR-OLD, HAD PASSED AWAY, HAD

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
DIED, HAD BEEN KILLED IN THIS

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING.

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SOME OF THE PARENTS WERE MEMBERS

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
CONGREGATIONS, AND THEY TRIED TO

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
DO WHATEVER THEY COULD TO

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
CONSOLE.

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
LET ME PLAY A LITTLE EXCERPT OF

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OUR CONVERSATION AT THE CHURCH

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
YESTERDAY.
>> SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
ME, REVEREND AND RABBI, HOW CAN

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
GOD ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
HAPPEN?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I FIRST SAY

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
IN THIS MOMENT, THIS IS NOT THE

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
MOMENT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION,

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AT LEAST NOT TO THE FAMILIES

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THAT ARE IN GRIEF.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I THINK THERE ARE ANSWERS.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THERE ARE ANSWERS FROM MY

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TRADITION THAT SPEAK TO

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SUFFERING AND HOW SUFFERING CAN

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
BE TRANSFORMATIVE, HOW AS A

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
CHRISTIAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
TRANSFORM AND BE TRANSFORMED BY

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SUFFERING.
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION THAT I TRY

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TO ANSWER TODAY BECAUSE PEOPLE

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
DON'T NEED TO HEAR WHAT BECOMES

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AN OVERSIMPLISTIC ANSWER TO

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SOMETHING THAT IS SO DEEP AND

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
PROFOUND.

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
>> WHAT WILL BE THE CENTRAL

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
MESSAGE THAT YOU TELL YOUR

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
CONGREGANTS TOMORROW MORNING.

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
>> I WILL BE PREACHING A MESSAGE

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THAT, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
DARKNESS, THERE IS LIGHT.

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
IT'S TRAGIC THAT WE ARE IN THE

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
MIDST OF THE SEASON FOR US AS

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
CHRISTIANS, WHICH IS

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
CHRISTMASTIME AND ADVENT, WHICH

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
IS A HOLY TIME FOR US, BUT WE

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ALSO KNOW IN THE MIDST OF A

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SEASON THAT WE SO OFTEN

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ASSOCIATE WITH JOY AND

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
MERRIMENT, THAT IT'S ALSO A

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SEASON OF DARKNESS.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IN FACT, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
TELLS US THAT THE LIGHT SHINES

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DARKNESS DOES NOT OVERCOME IT.

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'LL BE PREACHING A MESSAGE THAT

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
MS PROS, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THESE DARK TIMES, THAT WE KNOW

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THAT THE LIGHT OF GOD IS WITH US

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
AND THAT WE CAN BE SUSTAINED IN

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THAT AND THAT WE CAN SEE THAT

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
LIGHT IN EACH OTHER AND DRAW

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
FROM THAT LIGHT THAT IS A PART

124
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OF OUR FAITH.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WE CAN DO AS A REACTION TO THIS

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
IS TO THRIVE.

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I SET MY BANQUET IN THE PRESENCE

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OF MY ENEMIES.

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE ENEMY IS THE HORRIBLE EVENT,

131
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
AND THE BANQUET IS CONTINUING OR

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THRIVING IN LIFE.

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR TEN YEARS,

134
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
AND I SAW THE WAY THAT THE

135
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
ISRAELIS WOULD PICK UP AND GO

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
RIGHT TO THE SPOT WHERE

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED,
AND THE MESSAGE WAS WE CARRY ON,

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND WE WILL CARRY ON.

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WE HAVE GREAT SCHOOLS IN

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
NEWTOWN.
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THIS EVENT DOESN'T DEFINE US.

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GREAT

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SCHOOLS AND BE A GREAT

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
COMMUNITY.
MATTHEW AND I ARE GREAT FRIENDS,

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
AND ALL THE CLERGY ARE GREAT

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FRIENDS, AND WE WILL RECOVER.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> RABBI PRAVER AND PASTOR

148
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CREBBEN WILL BOTH BE AT THE

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SERVICE TONIGHT WHERE MEMBERS OF

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THE COMMUNITY WILL BE AT THE

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
PRAYER SERVICE.

152
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WE HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA SPENT

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
MOST OF THE DAY PREPARING HIS

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
REMARKS, SPEAKING FROM THE

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
HEART, SPEAKING FOR THE NATION,

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
BUT ALSO SPEAKING AS THE FATHER

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OF TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS AS WELL.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
ALL WE CAN THINK OF NOW,

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THE

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
PICTURES OF THE 6 AND 7-YEAR-OLD

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
KIDS, THE MEMORIALS, THE

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SERVICES THAT ARE CONTINUING.

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
BROOK BALDWIN IS JOINING US NOW

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WITH DETAILS ON A FEW OF THE

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
VICTIMS.

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
BROOK, THIS IS A HEARTBREAKING

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
STORY FOR ALL OF US.

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
>> Reporter: IT IS ABSOLUTELY

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
GUT WRENCHING, WOLF.

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WHEN YOU WALK AROUND NEWTOWN AND

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SEE THE MEMORIALS AND SEE THE

172
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
ADULTS HOLDING THE HANDS OF

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THEIR 4 AND 5-YEAR-OLDS CARRYING

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TEDDY BEARS, WHO ARE WIPING

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
TEARS AWAY AS THEY PLACE THESE

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TEDDY BEARS DOWN PERHAPS FOR

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
YOUNG PEOPLE THEY KNEW, PERHAPS

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T,

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BUT THEY WANT TO PAY RESPECT.

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WE WANT TO PAY RESPECT.

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AS WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THESE

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
LITTLE LIVES LOST, ALL 20 OF

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
BEFORE THIS MEMORIAL FOR US TO

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TALK ABOUT THE ADULTS, AND

186
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
REALLY THE HEROES AT THE SCHOOL.

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I WANT TO BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
VICTORIA, VICKI SOTO.

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SHE WAS YOUNG HERSELF, FIRST

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
GRADE TEACHER, 27 YEARS OF AGE.

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SHE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS AND

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
IMMEDIATELY GRABBED HER STUDENTS

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
AND TRIED TO MOVE THEM AWAY,

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
MOVE THEM AWAY FROM THE DOOR

195
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
WHEN HE ENTERED THE SCHOOL.

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
SHE IS ACTUALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE

197
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
HAD THE FORESIGHT TO HAVE HIDDEN

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SOME OF HER STUDENTS INSIDE A

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
CLOSET IN THE FIRST GRADE

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
CLASSROOM, AND LATER POLICE

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
FOUND SEVEN OF THEM, SEVEN

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SURVIVORS, THANKS TO VICKI SOTO

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
INSIDE THAT CLOSET.

204
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
LET ME READ THIS QUOTE FROM HER

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
COUSIN.
"SHE INSTINCTIVELY WENT INTO

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ACTION WHEN A MONSTER CAME INTO

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THE CLASSROOM AND TRIED TO

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
PROTECT THE KIDS SHE LOVED SO

209
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
MUCH.
WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
VICKI WAS A HERO."

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
TWO OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SCHOOL, YOU NEED TO HEAR THEIR

213
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
STORIES.
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, THE PRINCIPAL,

214
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
47 YEARS OF AGE.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SHE'D BEEN AT THE SCHOOL FOR TWO

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
YEARS.
WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HER, A FRIEND SAID SHE'S

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
PASSIONATE.
SHE ALWAYS HAD A SMILE ON HER

219
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
FACE.
SHE WAS JUST THAT KIND OF

220
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
EDUCATOR YOU WANTED IN CHARGE OF

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
YOUR STUDENTS.

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
KIDS LOVED HER.

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE FRIEND THAT WENT ON TO SAY

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
SHE WAS A TOUGH WOMAN BUT IN THE
RIGHT SENSE TOUGH.

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
AS I MENTIONED, SHE WAS A NEWER

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
PRINCIPAL, AND ONE OF HER

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
PRIORITIES, WHICH SHE, IN FACT,

228
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
FOLLOWED THROUGH ON, WAS

229
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
INSTALLING THIS NEW SECURITY

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SYSTEM AT THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SO THAT, IF THERE WERE TO BE A

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
STRANGER OR VISITOR TO COME TO

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THIS SCHOOL?

333
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
>> I WAS INVOLVED WITH SANDY

334
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
HOOK FOR 17 YEARS WITH MY

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
CHILDREN AND WITH A PROGRAM I

336
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
RUN THERE, AND THIS SCHOOL IS

337
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
UNIQUE IN THE FACT THAT, FOR

338
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
INSTANCE, THE PARENT COMMUNITY

339
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IS SO STRONG.

340
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WE HAD TO

341
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BEG FOR VOLUNTEERS.

342
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WE HAD SOMETIMES TO TURN

343
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
VOLUNTEERS AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS

344
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
SUCH AN ENGAGED COMMUNITY.

345
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THE STAFF, THE TEACHERS --

346
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
EVERYONE SAYS, WELL, TEACHERS

347
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
LOVE THEIR CHILDREN, AND THAT'S

348
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
VERY TRUE, BUT IN SANDY HOOK YOU

349
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
NEVER DOUBTED THAT THIS STAFF

350
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WAS COMMITTED TO EVERY CHILD, NO

351
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
MATTER THEIR ABILITY RATE, AND

352
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THAT THEY WERE VERY FOCUSED ON

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD

354
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SUCCEEDED.
OUR MOTTO AT SANDY HOOK WAS ALL

355
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
CHILDREN CAN AND WILL LEARN

356
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
WELL, AND THE TEACHERS TOOK THAT

357
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
VERY SERIOUSLY.

358
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
SO FOR ME AS A PARENT AND AS

359
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE SCHOOL

360
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
AS A REGULAR VOLUNTEER, IT WAS A

361
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PLACE OF JOY AND LOVE.

362
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
AND TO IMAGINE THOSE LITTLE

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
CHILDREN HAVING THAT VIOLATED IN

364
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
ALL OF US, THIS RIPPLES OUT

365
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BEYOND WHO'S IN THE SCHOOL

366
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
TODAY.
THE COLLEGE KIDS THAT USED TO GO

367
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
TO SANDY HOOK, THEY'RE

368
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
DEVASTATED.

369
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THEY'RE OUT THERE TALKING,

370
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
NEXT.

372
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THEY'RE BECOMING ACTIVISTS IN

373
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
DIFFERENT AREAS.

374
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO THIS

375
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SCHOOL THAT WAS SO CONNECTED

376
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THROUGH THE YEARS, NOT JUST

377
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
WHO'S THERE TODAY, BUT WE ALL

378
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
FEEL SO CONNECTED, IT MAKES IT

379
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
MUCH MORE TRAGIC AND MUCH MORE

380
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
VIOLATED.

381
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> I ALWAYS THINK TEACHERS ARE

382
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HEROES ON ANY GIVEN DAY.

383
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
>> YES, I AGREE.

384
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> BUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT

385
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
DAY, I TALKED TO ONE TEACHER

386
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
WHO, WHEN SHE SENSED SOMETHING

387
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
WAS GOING ON BUT DIDN'T KNOW

388
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WHAT, GATHERED HER KIDS, SAT

389
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THEM DOWN IN THE CORNER AS THEY

390
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
DRILLED, AND READ TO THEM.

391
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
>> WAS THAT MRS. FULNER?

392
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> RIGHT.
CONTINUED TO READ TO THEM.

393
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
>> CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS

394
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
ALWAYS HAVE THE CHILDREN

395
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
FOREMOST IN THEIR MIND, WHICH IS

396
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
TRUE FOR TEACHERS ACROSS THE

397
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
COUNTRY, AND I KNOW THAT.

398
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
BUT IN FOLLOWING THE DRILLS,

399
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
MAKING SURE ALL THE DRILLS WE'D

400
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
DONE, THEY ALL FOLLOWED THOSE

401
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
PROCEDURES.
WHOEVER IN THE OFFICE, ONE OF

402
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THE SECRETARIES, LEFT THAT

403
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
INTERCOM ON, THAT'S ONE OF THE

404
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BIGGEST HEROES OF THIS NIGHT.

405
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> THAT'S HOW EVERYONE KNEW

406
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

407
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THIS

408
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
COMMUNITY.
WHERE WE GO FROM HERE IS WE HAVE

409
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TO LEAD WITH LOVE, AND THAT'S

410
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT, THAT

411
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
IN THE SHORT TERM, LEADING WITH

412
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
LOVE TO PUT OUR ARMS AROUND THE

413
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
FAMILIES.
EVERYONE ACROSS THE WORLD IS

414
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
ASKING, HOW DO WE HELP?

415
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
YOU HELP WITH LOVE.

416
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THEN YOU DON'T LET LITTLE 6 AND

417
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
7-YEAR-OLD KIDS GET TRAPPED IN

418
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THEIR CLASSROOMS AND GUNNED DOWN

419
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
BY A MAD MAN WITH NO WAY OUT AND

420
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
NOT HAVE THAT CHANGE THE WAY WE

421
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
RESPOND TO THIS KIND OF

422
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
VIOLENCE.
WE HAVE TO GO FORWARD.

423
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
>> SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

424
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
>> SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

425
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.

426
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A

427
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
PEACEFUL, LOVING DISCUSSION AS A

428
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
COUNTRY AND MAYBE AT THE WORLD

429
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
LEVEL ABOUT MULTIPLE ISSUES,

430
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH, GUN

431
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
CONTROL, AND HOW WE BUILD OUR

432
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SCHOOLS.

433
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SANDY HOOK HAD THAT INTERCOM IN

434
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
PLACE AFTER COLUMBINE.

435
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
YOU COULD NOT GET INTO THAT

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SCHOOL.

437
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HE SHOT HIS WAY IN THROUGH GLASS

438
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
DOORS.

439
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
PERHAPS THE SCHOOLS NEED TO BE
CHANGED, BUT WE STRUCTURE

440
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
MATERIALS.

441
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AND I KNOW, BEING A BOARD

442
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
MEMBER, EVERYTHING IS MONEY.

443
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS.

444
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
WHAT I WANT IS EVERYONE TO COME

445
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
AT THIS IN A LOVING WAY.

446
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
WE'RE SO DIVISIVE ANY WAY AS A

447
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
COUNTRY, BUT THIS SHOULD BE A

448
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
DEFINING MOMENT WHERE WE COME

449
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
TOGETHER AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

450
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
TOGETHER.

451
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
>> I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE COME

452
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
UP AND TAKE ME BY THE HAND OR

453
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THE ARM AND SAY SOMETHING'S GOT

454
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
TO COME OUT OF THIS.

455
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
>> YOU CAN'T LET LITTLE

456
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
CHILDREN -- ALL THE OTHER

457
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TRAGEDIES WE'VE HAD HAVE BEEN

458
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
HORRIFIC, AND NOW WE'RE TALKING

459
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
ABOUT BABIES.

460
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AND GUNNED DOWN WITH A WEAPON

461
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THAT DIDN'T TAKE ANY

462
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
MARKSMANSHIP AT ALL.

463
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THIS STILL

464
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
HAPPENS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS

465
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
PLACE OF PEACE AND LOVE AND JOY

466
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
WHERE EVERYONE FELT SAFE, I HAD

467
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
TO SMILE.

468
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I WAS MUCH WAING WHAT YOU GUYS

469
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
WERE DOING NOW.

470
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
EVERY TIME YOU SAY SANDY HOOK,

471
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WHAT IT RESONATES IN ME IS

472
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
CHILDHOOD BECAUSE OF SANDY HOOK

473
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
SCHOOL, AND THAT'S AN INNOCENCE,

474
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
AND IT'S GONE NOW.

475
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
WE'LL GET IT BACK.

476
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THIS COMMUNITY WILL GET IT BACK.

477
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID

478
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
THAT IN NEWTOWN, A COUPLE OF

479
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME LAST NIGHT

480
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
AND SAID, LOOK, THIS IS NOT WHO

481
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WE ARE.

482
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
WE WANT THIS TOWN TO BE KNOWN

483
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
FOR WHO WE ARE.

484
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
>> AND THAT'S LOVE, AND THE

485
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
CARING AND COMPASSION.
>> AND WE SEE THAT IN THE

486
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
MEMORIALS THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP

487
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
EVERYWHERE.

488
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> IT'S MORE THAN PEOPLE SHOWING

489
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
UP.

490
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
IT'S PEOPLE REALLY, TRULY

491
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
BONDING, WHENEVER A FAMILY HAS A

492
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
TRAGEDY, BONDING AROUND THAT

493
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
FAMILY, 9/11, ANYTHING THAT'S

494
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN, PEOPLE RISE

495
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
TO THE OCCASION.

496
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR US THAT'S

497
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
HERE, BUT WE CAN'T HAVE THIS

498
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
KEEP HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE OR

499
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
EVEN IN ANOTHER NEWTOWN SCHOOL.

500
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

501
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
>> I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH

502
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
US.

503
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
>> THANK YOU, ANDERSON.

504
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
>> AND, WOLF, WE'VE HEARD THAT

505
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
FROM SO MANY PEOPLE, WANT

SOMETHING TO COME OUT OF THIS,

507
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
WANT SOMETHING TO BE DONE.

508
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
MAYBE WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT IT

509
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
TONIGHT AT THIS SERVICE WE'LL BE

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
STARTING AROUND 7:00.

511
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS HERE IN

OBVIOUSLY, WOLF, HE'LL BE

515
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
ATTENDING THAT SERVICE AND
SPEAKING AT THAT SERVICE.

516
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
>> THE FOLKS ARE ARRIVING AT THE

517
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
AUDITORIUM, AT THE HIGH SCHOOL,

518
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
NOT VERY FAR FROM YOU ARE, RIGHT

DOWN THE STREET FROM WHERE I AM

520

IN NEWTOWN.

521
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
YOU SEE SOME OF THE DIGNITARIES.

522
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
IF YOU LOOK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

523
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YOUR SCREEN, YOU CAN SEE NEAR

524
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THE STAGE SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN

525
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
STANDING THERE.

526
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THIS IS A DIFFERENT SHOT.

527
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
SENATOR LIEBERMAN, SENATOR

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE, AND PEOPLE ARE

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
JUST COMING HERE TO NEWTOWN TO

541
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
DO WHATEVER THEY CAN.

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
DONE LEMON IS OUT IN THE STREETS

543
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON.

544
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
DON, IT STARTED VERY SLOWLY,

545
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
WHAT WE SAW, PEOPLE JUST

546
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
BRINGING SOME TOYS OR SOME

547
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
FLOWERS, A CHRISTMAS TREE,

548
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
LEGOS.

549
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING IT TO OUR

550
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
VIEWERS.
NOW IT'S GROWING, AS YOU SAY,

551
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
VERY, VERY QUICKLY.

552
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
PEOPLE WANT TO SHOW THEIR

553
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
RESPECT.
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY DO.

554
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I SAID EXPONENTIALLY, AND IT IS

555
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
GROWING EXPONENTIALLY.

556
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
NOT JUST FROM AROUND THE STATE,

557
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
BUT FROM ALL OVER THE AREA,

558
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
TRISTATE AREA AND BEYOND.

559
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO SEE THIS.

560
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
YOU SEE THE PICTURES THERE OF

561
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000

DOGS, WINNIE THE POOH AND

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
FLOWERS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BUYING.

565
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
EVERY SECOND SOMEONE DROPS

566
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
SOMETHING OFF.

567
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
CANDY CANES HERE AND ORNAMENTS

568
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000

574
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK, ROMAN?

YOU CAME ALL THE WAY FROM NEW

576
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000

577
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND IT'S VERY

580
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
TRAGIC.
I THINK IT'S RESPECTFUL TO COME

581
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000

THIS IS SHOPS.
IT'S THE CENTER OF TOWN.

IT'S THE TOWN SQUARE.

615
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
USUALLY PEOPLE COME OUT HERE

616
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000

IT'S BEEN BLOCKED OFF BY POLICE

631

>> YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING.

674
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I WAS HOME SICK THAT FRIDAY WHEN

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I DIDN'T KNOW.

680
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000

682
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000

688
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
UNFATHOMABLE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR

SCHOOL DISTRICT, THE SCHOOL

690
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000

ANIMALS, AND THEY KEEP THEM

698
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
FOREVER AND PARENTS BECAUSE THEY

699
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000

CHILDREN, THOSE YOUNG LIVES THAT

705
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WERE LOST.

706
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
YOU CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS.

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000

REVEREND MATTHEW CREBBEN, WHO WE

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SPOKE TO EARLIER.

762
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
ON THE RIGHT, YOU SEE THE RABBI

763
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
PRAVER AS WELL.

764
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
PARTICIPATING IN THIS.

765
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
ALL THE FAITHS WILL BE PART OF

766
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THIS.

767
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
SANJAY, YOU'VE STUDIED, AS A

768
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
PHYSICIAN, HOW PEOPLE GRIEVE AND

769
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL

770
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
PROBLEMS THAT CAN DEVELOP.

771
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WHEN I SPOKE TO THE RABBI AND

772
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
THE MINISTER YESTERDAY, THEY

773
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WERE IN THE FIRE THERE IS HOUSE

774
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
WHEN THE PARENTS WERE TOLD THEIR

775
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
CHILDREN ARE DEAD, AND THEY

776
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
STARTED WAILING AND SCREAMING.

777
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

778
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WHAT DO YOU DO?

779
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING

780
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
THROUGH THIS.

781
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
>> AND THEY WILL GO THROUGH IT

782
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

783
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
IMAGINE THE IDEA OF A PARENT

784
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
LOSING THEIR CHILD.

785
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
PERHAPS IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

786
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
IT'S SOMETHING THEY WON'T GET

787
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
OVER.
IT'S JUST HARD TO EVEN FATHOM,

788
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
WOLF.
I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S

789
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
DIFFERENT STAGES OF GRIEF.

790
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THE DISBELIEF, I THINK, THAT

791
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS VERY

792
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
NORMAL.
FIRST STAGE.

793
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
SOMETIMES THERE'S ANGER, AND

794
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THAT ANGER AND SHOCK SORT OF

795
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TOGETHER.

796
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
BUT EVENTUALLY I'M JUST SO

797
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
STRUCK BY ROBBIE PARKER'S

798
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
COMMENTS YESTERDAY --

799
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
>> THE 30-YEAR-OLD FATHER, A

800
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT.

801
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
>> AND HIS DAUGHTER EMILIE WAS

802
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
ONE OF THE VICTIMS HERE.

803
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
HIS ACCEPTANCE AND HIS

804
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
FORGIVENESS SO SOON AFTER IS

805
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
REMARKABLE TO SEE.
I THINK THAT'S A STAGE THAT

806
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
EVENTUALLY PEOPLE GET TO, THIS

807
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
IDEA OF ACCEPTANCE.

808
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
IT DOES NOT COME EASILY, AND FOR

809
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SOME PEOPLE IT MAY NOT COME AT

810
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
ALL, BUT THOSE ARE SORT OF THE

811
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
STAGES, I THINK.

812
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN A MEDICAL

813
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SENSE, WHEN SOMEONE IS SICK IN A

814
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
HOSPITAL, FOR EXAMPLE, OR IF

815
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
YOU'VE LOST A LOVED ONE IN A

816
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
HOSPITAL, BUT CERTAINLY IN A

817
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
MASS TRAGEDY LIKE THIS, IT'S A

818
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
LOT OF THE SAME THING.

819
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
AGAIN, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

820
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
IDEA -- AND DON MENTIONED THIS

821
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
IDEA, PEOPLE SORT OF KNOWING

822
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING

823
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING, THAT

824
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THEY ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY SORT

825
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
OF EXPERIENCING THIS TOGETHER, I

826
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
THINK, CAN MAKE A HUGE

827
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
DIFFERENCE FOR THEM.

828
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

829
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
OUR COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE RIGHT

830
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
AFTER THIS.

831
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THE INTERFAITH MEMORIAL SERVICE

832
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
WILL START WITH THE PRESIDENT

833
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AND THE CLERGY AND THE FAMILIES,

834
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
COME BETWEEN US

SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE
WHO GETS HEARTBURN

A CHURCH TEACHER WHO SPENT TIME

WITH SOME OF THE KIDS WHO WERE

866
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
SHE IS NOW A CHURCH TEACHER, AND

873
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000

876
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SO

877
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
MANY OF THE STUDENTS WERE IN A

878
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
CLASSROOM SETTING SINCE THE

879
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
TRAGIC EVENTS ON FRIDAY.

880
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT WAS FOR

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
STUDENTS.

883
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
SHE SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF

884
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
ANXIETY, ANXIETY ON THE PART OF

885
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
THE PARENTS.
SOME OF THE PARENTS WERE UNSURE

886
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
ABOUT PUTTING THEIR CHILDREN

887
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
BACK IN A CLASSROOM SETTING EVEN

888
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000

889
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
CLASSROOM SETTING SO SOON.

890
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN ARE AT MUCH

891
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
DIFFERENT LEVELS.
SOME OF THE CHILDREN DIDN'T KNOW

892
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ANYTHING ABOUT THE EVENT.

893
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN DID KNOW.

894
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN KNEW SOME

895
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
OF THE YOUNG BOYS AND YOUNG

896
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
GIRLS THAT HAD BEEN KILLED.

897
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
SO WE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THOSE

898
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
THINGS IN A VERY CANDID, VERY

899
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
EMOTIONAL CONVERSATION JUST A

900
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
LITTLE EARLIER.

901
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO JUST A

902
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
SMALL SAMPLE OF THAT

903
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
CONVERSATION.

904
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
SUNDAYY SCHOOL WAS TODAY.

905
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
YOU HAD A LOT OF CHILDREN HERE

906
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
IN THIS ROOM.
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE FOR YOU?

907
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
>> THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT -- IT

908
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
WAS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY BECAUSE

909
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I SPENT YESTERDAY TRYING TO

910
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
PREPARE FOR TODAY, BUT YOU DON'T

911
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

912
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
AND THEN LATER ON WHERE WE GOT

913
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
TO THE PART WHERE WE PRAYED,

914
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
PRETTY MUCH EVERY CHILD IN HERE

915
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
MY FRIEND BEN DIED.

918
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
MY FRIEND CHARLOTTE DIED.

919
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SO WE PRAYED.

920
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
WE PRAYED.
WE PROBABLY PRAYED MORE THAN

921
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
WE'VE EVER PRAYED BEFORE.
AND THEN SOME OF THEM PRAYED FOR

922
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THEIR MOM AND DAD, AND SOME OF

923
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
THEM PRAYED FOR BUTTERFLIES

924
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL AT DIFFERENT

925
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
PLACES.

926
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
>> AGAIN, JUST A SMALL SAMPLING

927
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
OF SOME OF THE CONVERSATION WE

928
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WERE HAVING.
I'LL SHOW THAT LATER TONIGHT ON

929
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
YOUR SHOW, ANDERSON.

930
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS SHE

931
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT WHAT WAS

932
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
HAPPENING WITH HER TODAY IS THAT

933
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
SHE REALLY FELT STRONGLY THAT

934
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WHAT IS HELPING HER, SOME OF THE

935
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
OTHER TEACHERS, AND EVEN SOME OF

936
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THE CHILDREN GET THROUGH ALL OF

937
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
THIS IS THE FACT THAT THEY'VE

938
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
BEEN RECEIVING AN OUTPOURING OF

939
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE

940
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
COUNTRY.

941
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
AND STRANGELY ENOUGH, EVEN SOME

942
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
OF THE YOUNG CHILDREN ARE

943
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
FEELING THAT.

944
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT KNEW

945
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED SAID

946
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THEY KNEW THEY WERE GETTING

947
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM AS

948
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
FAR AWAY PLACES AS SOUTH AMERICA

949
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
AND SOUTH AFRICA.

950
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
SO THOSE WERE SOME OF THE

951
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
POSITIVE THINGS THAT HAPPENED,

952
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF EMOTION

953
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THERE IN THAT CLASSROOM TODAY.

954
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
ANDERSON?
>> THERE'S EMOTION REALLY

955
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
EVERYWHERE IN THIS TOWN.

956
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME UP TO ME

957
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
AND SAY, I HAVE NO MORE TEARS

958
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
LEFT.
AND YET WE SEE PEOPLE CRYING ALL

959
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
THE TIME.
IT'S HARD NOT TO WHEN YOU'RE

960
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
HERE.

961
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ARRIVAL, OF

962
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
COURSE, REMINDS US OF THE MANY

963
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
DIFFICULT ROLES THAT A PRESIDENT

964
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
PLAYS IN OUR NATIONAL LIFE.

965
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF

966
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

967
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
JESSICA YELLIN, WHO'S JOINING ME

968
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HERE RIGHT NOW.

969
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
THE PRESIDENT, WE BELIEVE, IS

970
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
ALREADY INSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL,

971
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
YES?
>> YES, HE'S GRIEVING AND

972
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
COMFORTING FAMILIES WHO HAVE

973
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
LOST LOVED ONES.

974
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
>> AND THE SERVICE IS TO START

975
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
AT 7:00.
HE'LL ALSO BE SPEAKING THERE.

976
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
>> HE'LL BE SPEAKING, AND I'M

977
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
TOLD THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

978
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
HIMSELF BEEN WORKING ON THESE

979
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
REMARKS.
HE'S TAKEN IT PERSONALLY AND

980
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
BEEN PREPARING THEM, EVEN ON HIS

981
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
WAY UP HERE, ANDERSON.

982
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
TOLD THAT THE REMARKS WILL SPEAK

983
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
TO THE NATION'S OBLIGATIONS TO

984
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
OUR CHILDREN.

985
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO OFTEN

986
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
STRUGGLES TO SHOW EMOTION, AND

987
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
WE SAW HIM SO UNUSUALLY

988
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
EMOTIONAL ON FRIDAY.

989
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SOME OF THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO

990
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
HIM TELL ME IT'S BECAUSE THIS

991
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
TRAGEDY HAS TOUCHED HIM AS MUCH

992
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
AS ANY EVENT IN HIS POLITICAL

993
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
LIFE, AND WE SAW THAT WHEN HE

994
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
CAME OUT TO THE BRIEFING ROOM
AND ADDRESSED IT.

995
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT HE

996
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
SAID.

997
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
>> SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

998
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
TODAY FOR THE PARENTS AND

999
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

1000
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1001
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

1002
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

1003
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1004
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

1005
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WELL, FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE

1006
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1007
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

1008
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1009
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY,

1010
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

1011
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

1012
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
>> IT REALLY WAS REMARKABLE TO

1013
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
SEE THE PRESIDENT LIKE THAT.

1014
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
HE DID INTIMATE THE POSSIBILITY

1015
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
OF SOMETHING REALLY INTO GUN

1016
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
CONTROL.

1017
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
HE DIDN'T USE THE WORDS GUN

1018
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
CONTROL, BUT HE TALKED ABOUT

1019
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
SOME SORT OF CHANGE.

1020
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
>> HE SAID IT'S TIME TO TAKE

1021
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION, AND HE DIDN'T

1022
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
SPECIFY WHAT THAT IS TO HIM.

1023
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HE DID VOW TO STAND FOR THE

1024
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
REPEAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS

1025
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
BAN IN HIS FIRST TERM.

1026
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HE DID NOT PRESS FOR THAT, TO

1027
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE.

1028
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
HE NEVER PRESSED FOR THAT.

1029
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THOSE ARE TWO ACTIONS HE COULD

1030
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
TAKE.

1031
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION, WILL

1032
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
HE PURSUE SOME SORT OF MENTAL

1033
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
HEALTH REFORMS?

1034
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IT'S INTERESTING HE WILL NEVER

1035
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
HAVE TO STAND FOR RE-ELECTION.

1036
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THE GUN

1037
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
LOBBY.

1038
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THAT'S SOMETHING DEMOCRATS OFTEN

1039
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
CONTEND WITH.
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HE PRESSES

1040
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
FOR, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG

1041
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
CHALLENGES TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, ANDERSON, FOR HIM HE

1042
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
HAS TO EXPRESS THE NATION'S

1043
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
GRIEF, BUT THE MORE EFFECTIVE HE

1044
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
IS AT CAPTURING THE NATION'S

1045
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
EMOTIONS TONIGHT, THE MORE

1046
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
PEOPLE WILL TURN TO HIM AS THE

1047
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
PERSON WHO IS THE SYMBOL OF

1048
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM, THE MORE

1049
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
EFFECTIVE HE CAN BE AT

1050
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
ADVOCATING WHATEVER POLICY HE

1051
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
CHOOSES TO PURSUE IN THE WAKE OF

1052
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THIS TRAGEDY.

1053
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
>> AND THE WHOLE MENTAL HEALTH

1054
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO

1055
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
RARELY ADDRESSED.

1056
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
IT'S TREATED SO DIFFERENTLY THAN

1057
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
OTHER FORMS OF ILLNESS.

1058
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WE'LL SEE IF THIS EVENT DOES

1059
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
CHANGE THAT IN SOME WAY.

1060
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
>> AND IT WAS A NATURAL ONE FOR

1061
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
HIS GOOD FRIEND TED KENNEDY.

1062
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WE'LL SEE IF THAT HELPS HIM.

1063
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
>> ALL OF THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
AT 7:00.

1064
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
LET'S GO BACK TO WOLF.

1065
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
>> ANDERSON, LET'S GET MORE NOW

1066
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ON THE FIRST VICTIM OF THIS

1067
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
RAMPAGE, THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER

1068
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
NANCY LANZA.

1069
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
CNN'S ERIN BURNETT SAT DOWN WITH

1070
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
FRIENDS OF NANCY LANZA AT A

1071
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
RESTAURANT SHE PATRONIZED

1072
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.

1073
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THEY SAID THAT NANCY DIDN'T HAVE

1074
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A REGULAR DAY JOB BUT DEDICATED

1075
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HER TIME TO CHARITY WORK.

1076
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
>> WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET

1077
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
NANCY?

1078
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
>> 12, 13 YEARS AGO.

1079
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
MET HER RIGHT HERE IN THE BAR.

1080
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SHE'D COME IN HERE AND HAVE

1081
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
TAKEOUT FOOD, AND WE GOT TO KNOW

1082
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
EACH OTHER.
WE USED TO TALK IN THE BAR.

1083
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
JUST LIKE CLICKED, AND THAT WAS

1084
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
IT.
YOU KNOW, JUST STARTED TALKING

1085
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
AND WE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS.

1086
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
>> SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY,

1087
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
OUTGOING.

1088
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SHE WAS FUNNY.
WE TOOK TO HER.

1089
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
SO, YEAH, SHE JUST BECAME FAST

1090
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
FRIENDS WITH US.

1091
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
SHE DID A LOT IN TOWN, WAS

1092
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
ALWAYS ON THE GO.

1093
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
>> GIVEN THAT YOU KNEW HER AS A

1094
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
PERSON AND SOME OF THE THINGS

1095
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
YOU'VE BEEN HEARING AS THE

1096
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
COUNTRY STARTED TO LEARN A

1097
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER, WHAT DO

1098
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
YOU THINK SOME OF THE BIGGEST

1099
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
MISCONCEPTIONS ARE THAT YOU'VE

1100
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HEARD ON THE NEWS?

1101
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>> I THINK MOSTLY THE -- BETWEEN

1102
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THE CONDITION THAT HE HAD, WHICH

1103
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
PEOPLE COULD CONFUSE FOR BEING

1104
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THE REASON, AND THE GUNS.

1105
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
YOU KNOW, WE -- WE DON'T THINK

1106
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER

1107
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
CHARACTER.

1108
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
>> SHE DONATED HER TIME FOR ALL

1109
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
CHARITABLE WORK, HELPING PEOPLE

1110
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THAT NEEDED HELP.

1111
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
HELPING AIDS PEOPLE, DONATE

1112
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
MONEY FOR AIDS AND CHARITIES.

1113
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

1114
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
SHE DIDN'T GET PAID FOR DOING

1115
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
WHAT SHE DID.

1116
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
ALL CHARITABLE WORK.

1117
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SHE DID IT ALL ON HER OWN.

1118
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
>> VERY GENEROUS.

1119
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
>> VERY GENEROUS PERSON.

1120
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
A PERSON COULD BE SITTING HERE

1121
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
AND JUST SAY YOU'RE TALKING TO

1122
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
HER, AND THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE

1123
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
SAYING, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

1124
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
FOR THIS OR ANY MONEY FOR THAT,

1125
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
SHE'D TAKE OUT HER CHECKBOOK AND

1126
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
WRITE A CHECK OUT AND GIVE IT TO

1127
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THE PERSON WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING

1128
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THEM.
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE

1129
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WAS.
>> JUST KIND.

1130
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> SHE WAS A GENEROUS, KIND

1131
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
PERSON.
>> SHOOTER KILLED HIS MOTHER.

1132
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST VICTIM OF THIS

1133
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
BRUTAL, BRUTAL MASSACRE.

1134
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT SOME

1135
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
OF THE OTHER VICTIMS AS WELL.

1136
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
BROOK BALDWIN IS JOINING US ONCE

1137
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
AGAIN.
THESE STORIES ARE SO, SO HEART

1138
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
WRENCHING, EACH AND EVERY ONE.

1139
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
26 PEOPLE, 6 ADULTS, ALL WOMEN,

1140
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
20 KIDS, ALL FIRST GRADERS.

1141
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
>> Reporter: IT IS ABSOLUTELY

1142
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
GUT WRENCHING WHEN YOU START

1143
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
HEARING ABOUT THE STORIES OF

1144
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THESE YOUNGSTERS.

1145
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, ONE

1146
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
OF THE GRANDPARENTS, A

1147
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
GRANDFATHER OF TWO YOUNG KIDS

1148
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
WHO WERE ACTUALLY IN VICKI

1149
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
DESO

1150
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
DESOTO'S FIRST GRADE CLASS JUST

1151
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
CAME UP TO ME.

1152
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO ON CAMERA,

1153
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
BUT HE SAID THE FIRST THING HIS

1154
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
GRANDDAUGHTER SAID AFTER RUNNING

1155
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
PAST THE GUNMAN AND SURVIVING

1156
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
WAS SHE WANTED TO SEE THE

1157
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
PRESIDENT TONIGHT.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A CAPACITY

1158
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
CROWD, AND SHE COULDN'T GET IN.

1159
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO GO

1160
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON WEDNESDAY,

1161
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
ACCORDING TO THIS GRANDPARENT.

1162
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE

1163
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
ABOUT THESE LITTLE LIVES LOST.

1164
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I JUST WANT TO BEGIN WITH

1165
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SOMEONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

1166
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE HEARD

1167
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
FROM HER FATHER.

1168
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
SHE WAS EMILIE PARKER, 6 YEARS

1169
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
OLD.

1170
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
NOT A DRY EYE WHEN EVERYONE WAS

1171
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
HEARING THE DETAILS OF HER LIFE

1172
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
FROM HER YOUNG FATHER.

1173
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
ACCORDING TO HER FATHER, HE SAID

1174
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
EMILIE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

1175
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WHO COULD LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1176
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SHE WAS BRIGHT.

1177
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SHE WAS CREATIVE.

1178
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
SHE WAS LOVING.

1179
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
HER LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS.

1180
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
SHE WAS THE OLDEST OF THREE

1181
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
LITTLE GIRLS, AND HER FATHER

1182
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
SAID THAT EMILIE WAS A MENTOR

1183
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THIS THEM.

1184
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER.

1185
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THEY'RE WONDERING WHERE THEIR

1186
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
SISTER IS.

1187
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
JESSICA RICO, 6 YEARS OLD.

1188
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST BORN.

1189
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
SHE WAS THEIR ROCK.

1190
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SHE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE CEO.

1191
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SHE DID ALL THE DETAILING.

1192
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
SHE LOVED THE FAMILY OUTINGS AND

1193
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
GOT TO PLAN THEM.

1194
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SHE LOVED HORSES, LIKE EVERY

1195
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
6-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

1196
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
SHE WAS DRAWING HORSES AND LOVED

1197
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
TO WATCH HORSE MOVIES.

1198
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
SHE ASKED SANTA CLAUS, NOT TOO

1199
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
LONG AGO, FOR THIS CHRISTMAS,

1200
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
SHE WANTED COWGIRL BOOTS AND A

1201
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
COWGIRL HAT.

1202
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
SADLY, THOSE GIFTS WILL NOT BE

1203
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OPENED.
SHE HAS TWO LITTLE BROTHERS, AND

1204
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
HER BABY BROTHER TRAVIS DOESN'T

1205
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
UNDERSTAND WHY HE CAN'T PLAY

1206
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

1207
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
ONE MORE, OLIVIA ENGEL, 6.

1208
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
FAMILY SAYS SHE WAS PRECOCIOUS

1209
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
AND COMPLETELY ENDEARING.

1210
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
NOTHING WAS OFF LIMITS FOR HER.

1211
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
SHE LOVED BALLET.

1212
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SHE LOVED TO SWIM.

1213
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SHE LOVED SOCCER.

1214
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
SHE LOVED GIRL SCOUTS.

1215
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
AND HER FAVORITE COLORS WERE

1216
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PINK AND PURPLE.

1217
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
AND EVERY NIGHT, WOLF AND

1218
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ANDERSON, SHE LED THE TABLE AT

1219
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
DINNER WITH GRACE.

1220
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THESE ARE JUST 3 OF THE 20

1221
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
YOUNGSTERS WHO ARE NO LONGER

1222
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
WITH US HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1223
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
CONNECTICUT.

1224
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
>> EVERY ONE OF THESE KIDS SO,

1225
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
SO BEAUTIFUL, SO ADORABLE, AND

1226
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SO TRAGIC.

1227
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
WHAT A WAY TO BE FOR THEIR LIVES

1228
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
TO END SO PREMATURELY.

1229
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
FOR OUR VIEWERS WHO WOULD LIKE

1230
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
TO HELP, THEY CAN DO SO, THEY

1231
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
CAN ONCE AGAIN GO TO

1232
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
CNN.COM/IMPACT, AND THEY'LL HAVE

1233
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
A CHANCE TO IMPACT OUR WORLD.

1234
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SANJAY IS HERE WITH US AS WELL.

1235
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
SANJAY, MENTAL HEALTH, IT'S A

1236
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
HUGE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.

1237
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
THIS SHOOTER OBVIOUSLY HAD

1238
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS TREATED

1239
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
FOR THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS ON

1240
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
MEDICATION.
THEY DID RELEASE THE AUTOPSY

1241
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
RESULTS TODAY.

1242
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
>> AS EXPECTED, IT WASN'T GOING

1243
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TO PROVIDE ANSWERS AS FAR AS IF

1244
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY

1245
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THAT COULD EXPLAIN THIS.

1246
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I THINK WE KNOW THAT HE

1247
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

1248
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THEY WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT AS

1249
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
PART OF THE AUTOPSY, BUT THAT

1250
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
WAS REALLY ABOUT IT.

1251
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1252
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THIS WHOLE NOTION OF MENTAL

1253
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
HEALTH, BEING ON PAR OR HAVING

1254
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
PARITY, AS WE CALL IT, WITH

1255
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
PHYSICAL DISEASES, WITH HEART

1256
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
DISEASE, WITH DIABETES, CANCER,

1257
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WHATEVER IT IS.
IN THOSE SITUATIONS, WOLF, WE

1258
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
KNOW WE CAN SEND SOMEONE TO A

1259
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
DOCTOR OR THEY CAN GET CARE.

1260
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
>> IF YOU HAVE A TEMPERATURE, IF

1261
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
YOU HAVE THE FLU, YOU'RE
COUGHING, YOU TREAT IT.

1262
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
BUT SOMETIMES PARENTS SEE MENTAL

1263
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
HEALTH ISSUES, AND THEY DON'T DO

1264
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.

1265
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
>> I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

1266
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
POINT BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY, LOOK,

1267
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THEY MISSED THE SIGNS, OR THEY

1268
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
WERE IN DENIAL.

1269
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
SOMETIMES IT MAY BE TRUE, BUT

1270
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
OFTENTIMES, AS YOU'VE HEARD THE

1271
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
STORIES OVER THE YEARS, PARENTS

1272
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF ANGUISH

1273
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
OVER MAYBE IN THIS CASE THEIR

1274
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
CHILD'S MENTAL HEALTH, BUT THERE

1275
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ISN'T MUCH THAT THEY CAN DO.

1276
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I MEAN, THE RESOURCES AREN'T

1277
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THERE NECESSARILY, EITHER IN THE

1278
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
MEDICAL SENSE OR JUST HAVING

1279
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
ENOUGH PHYSICIANS OR HAVING THE

1280
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO

1281
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
SUPPORT THIS.

1282
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
PART OF IT IS ALSO STIGMA.

1283
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
IT STILL VERY MUCH EXISTS.

1284
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
IT'S EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME.

1285
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S GETTING

1286
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
BETTER, BUT THIS IDEA OF, IF YOU

1287
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
GET TREATED FOR A MENTAL

1288
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
ILLNESS, YOU'LL BE STAG MA

1289
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
TIESED, AND IT WILL AFFECT YOU

1290
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, NEEDS

1291
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
TO BE DISPELLED.

1292
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
YOU CAN GET TREATMENT.

1293
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> THERE IS MEDICATION THAT

1294
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE, TEENAGERS

1295
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
AND ADULTS CAN TAKE, BUT A LOT

1296
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
OF TIMES THEY JUST REFUSE TO

1297
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TAKE THE MEDICATION.

1298
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
SOMETIMES THE RESULTS CAN BE

1299
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
TRAGIC.
>> MEDICATIONS.

1300
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
COGNITIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN SHOWN

1301
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THESE SORTS

1302
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
OF THINGS.
GROUP THERAPY.

1303
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
SOME OF IT WE'RE SEEING NOW,

1304
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT

1305
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
SITUATION, BUT THIS IDEA AGAIN

1306
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WHO

1307
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
ARE MENTAL ILLNESS, THEY'RE NOT

1308
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
ALONE.
THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM BEING IN

1309
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
SESSIONS WHERE IT'S SHOWN TO

1310
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
THEM, THAT THEY HAVE GROUPS TO

1311
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
SUPPORT.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

1312
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THEY HAVE THINGS THAT CAN BE

1313
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
DONE.

1314
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF MAKING A

1315
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SYSTEM POSSIBLE FOR THOSE

1316
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
PEOPLE.
WE'RE NOT THERE.

1317
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS A

1318
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
PHYSICIAN.
AND THE HOSPITALS ARE RIGHT,

1319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WE'RE NOT THERE.

1320
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THAT PARITY IS SOMETHING THAT

1321
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

1322
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF THE

1323
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE AT THIS

1324
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
SCHOOL, CHILDREN ALL OVER THE

1325
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
COUNTRY, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

1326
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
SERIOUS ISSUES NOW DEALING WITH

1327
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
THE FALLOUT FROM THIS.

1328
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS IS

1329
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
SOMETHING THAT EXISTS IN

1330
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
CHILDREN AS WELL.

1331
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
AGAIN, WE THINK ABOUT IT

1332
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
PRIMARILY IN ADULTS, BUT IT

1333
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
MANIFESTS.
IT DISPLAYS IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

1334
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
CHILDREN MAY REGRESS A BIT, THEY

1335
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
MAY NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

1336
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
SLEEP IS SO IMPORTANT.

1337
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
YOU CAN PREDIBLLINGT -- IT'S A

1338
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
VERY POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF HOW

1339
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE ARE

1340
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
GOING TO DO BY HOW WELL THEY'RE

1341
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SLEEPING.
IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

1342
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
PARENTS CAN DO TONIGHT AND THE

1343
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
NEXT FEW NIGHTS AS THEY'RE

1344
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
TALKING TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT

1345
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
IT, MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING

1346
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
SLEEP BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE

1347
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
A BIG POWERFUL PREDICTOR FOR

1348
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
THEIR FUTURE.

1349
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
EVERYONE IS GATHERED AROUND THE

1460
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
CHRISTMAS TREE AND HANGING OUT

1461
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

1465
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOWN HERE

1466
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
TONIGHT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE

1467
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
PART OF THIS.

1468
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
THIS IS WHERE THE MEDIA IS

1469
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
CAMPED OUT.

1470
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THAT'S WHERE THE METHODIST

1471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
CHURCH IS WHERE YOU AND I WERE

1472
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
LAST NIGHT, ANDERSON.

1473
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
AND THIS CHRISTMAS TREE HERE

1474
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
EVERY YEAR, IT'S A BIG CHRISTMAS

MEMORIAL THAT WE HAVE BEEN

1477
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
TALKING ABOUT.

1478
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
IT'S GROWING BY THE MINUTE HERE.

1479
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THERE'S SO MANY STUFFED ANIMALS

1480
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
AND THINGS THEY PILED ON TOP OF

1481
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
EACH OTHER.

1482
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THEY'RE MAKING SURE ALL THE

1483
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
CANDLES ARE LIT.

1484
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
SOMEONE COMES BY WITH A LIGHTER

1485
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

1486
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
THIS GENTLEMAN IS STANDING BY

1487
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
HERE.
YOU'VE LIVED IN THIS COMMUNITY

1488
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

1489
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
>> YES.

1490
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000

1491
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000

1492
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
MY FAMILY'S BEEN HERE SINCE THE

1493
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
1930s, AND I'VE LIVED HERE MY

1494
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
WHOLE LIFE.

1495
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
IT'S DEVASTATING.

1496
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
THERE'S NO WORDS.

1497
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
IT'S A NIGHTMARE, A COMPLETE

1498
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
NIGHTMARE.
OUR TOWN WILL REBUILD.

1499
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS NOT WHAT

1500
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
YOU WANT THIS TOWN TO BE

1501
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
REMEMBERED FOR?

1502
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

1503
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
WE'RE ON THE MAP FOR THE WRONG

1504
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
REASONS.
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.

1505
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> Reporter: HOW ARE YOU AND CAN

1506
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
YOU -- I IMAGINE THAT YOU WILL

1507
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
RECOVER, BUT IT WILL NEVER BE

1508
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
THE SAME HERE.

1509
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
>> IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME,

1510
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
BUT DAY BY DAY, SAY OUR PRAYERS,

1511
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
AND THINGS WILL GET BACK

1512
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
TOGETHER EVENTUALLY.

1513
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
>> Reporter: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1514
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000

1515
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
THESE STAY LIGHTED.

1516
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
>> WE HAVE ALL GROWN UP HERE AND

1517
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WE FEEL THESE CANDLES NEED TO

1518
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
STAY LIT.

1519
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THESE ARE FOR THE 26 GORGEOUS

1520
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
ANGELS NOW IN HEAVEN, AND IT'S

1521
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
OUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE

1522
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
IN IN TOWN, INCLUDING THIS

1523
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
MEMORIAL.

1524
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
SCHOOL HERE?
>> YEAH, WE ALL DID.

1525
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
>> Reporter: WHY DID YOU GO TO

1526
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
SCHOOL?

1527
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
>> WE WENT TO A COUPLE DIFFERENT

1528
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, BUT WE ALL

1529
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
WENT THROUGH THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL

1530
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
SYSTEM ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH

1531
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
SCHOOL.
>> Reporter: YOU FELT SAFE THEN,

1532
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

1533
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
>> THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT

1534
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
NOTHING CHANGES ABOUT THIS TOWN.

1535
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THIS TOWN IS A WONDERFUL,

1536
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO GROW UP IN,

1537
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THESE

1538
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN WILL NOT

1539
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
EXPERIENCE WHAT WE'VE

1540
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
EXPERIENCED, BUT OUR THOUGHTS

1541
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS TOWN
HAVE NOT CHANGED.

1542
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS

1543
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
TOGETHER.

1544
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> Reporter: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1545
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000

1546
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, GUYS.

1547
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
GOD BLESS YOU.
I WANT TO MOVE DOWN HERE AND

1548
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
TALK TO SOME OF THESE FOLKS.

1549
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
THESE GUYS, YOU'RE FROM A

1550
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN?

1551
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> YEAH.

1552
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
>> Reporter: AND THEY'RE RIVALS,

1553
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
MAYBE SPORTS RIVALS, BUT TONIGHT

1554
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
YEAR ALL TOGETHER?

1555
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

1556
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

1557
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
HAPPENS, I MEAN, TOWNS AROUND

1558
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
HERE ARE REALLY CLOSE.

1559
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
WE JUST PULL TOGETHER FOR EACH

1560
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
OTHER.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S

1561
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
IMPORTANT, AND AROUND, YOU KNOW,

1562
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
THE HOLIDAY SEASON, I THINK IT'S

1563
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
GREAT TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT

1564
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
HERE FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE

1565
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER.

1566
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
YOU KNOW, IT HELPS A LITTLE BIT,

1567
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
BUT CIRCUMSTANCES STILL TOUGH.

1568
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
>> Reporter: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1569
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> I'M ARDIAN.

1570
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
>> Reporter: WHAT YOU DO YOU

1571
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
PLAY?
>> FOOTBALL, SIR.

1572
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
>> FOR WHICH TOWN?

1573
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
>> NEW FAIRFIELD HIGH SCHOOL.

1574
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
>> I PLAYED BASEBALL FOR NEW

1575
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
FAIRFIELD AS WELL.

1576
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
>> Reporter: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1577
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> I'M TREVOR.

1578
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I PLAYED FOOTBALL AND TRACK.

1579
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER WHO IS 8

1580
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
YEARS OLD.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE

1581
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH NOW.

1582
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
>> Reporter: WHERE WERE YOU WHEN

1583
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS?

1584
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
>> I WAS ACTUALLY AT MY HOUSE,

1585
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
JUST GOT BACK FROM COLLEGE, AND

1586
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I THINK IT WAS ALL THE SAME

1587
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE,

1588
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
TOO.

1589
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
WE LOOKED AT OUR PHONES AND

1590
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
REALIZED IT WAS HAPPENING.

1591
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
WE REALIZED IT WAS A TOWN OVER

1592
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
AND IT REALLY HIT HARD WHEN WE

1593
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
KNEW LIKE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE

1594
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
INVOLVED AND EVERYTHING LIKE

1595
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THAT.
>> Reporter: I ASKED THE OTHER

1596
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
GENTLEMAN, THIS IS NOT

1597
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
SOMETHING -- OR SAID TO HIM THIS

1598
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT YOUR

1599
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
TOWN OR THE TOWNS IN THIS AREA

1600
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
OF CONNECTICUT TO BE KNOWN FOR.

1601
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

1602
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
IT'S JUST A TRAGEDY AND WE'RE

1603
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
TRYING TO GO THROUGH IT

1604
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
TOGETHER.
>> Reporter: THE ENTIRE WORLD IS

1605
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
WATCHING TONIGHT, NOT JUST IN

1606
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THE UNITED STATES BUT OUR

1607
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
VIEWERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

1608
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW

1609
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ABOUT THE PEOPLE HERE?

1610
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
>> PEOPLE HERE ARE GREAT.

1611
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
JUST AN AREA FILLED WITH

1612
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
WONDERFUL PEOPLE.

1613
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I COULDN'T BE BLESSED WITH

1614
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
BETTER NEIGHBORS THAN I HAVE.

1615
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I HAVE TONS OF ROLE MODELS

1616
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
STARTING WITH MY FRIENDS, MY

1617
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
TEACHERS, MY FAMILY.

1618
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I THINK EVERYONE AROUND HERE IS

1619
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
FAMILY.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T BASE -- YOU

1620
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
CAN'T JUDGE A TOWN OR PEOPLE

1621
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
BASED ON AN OCCURRENCE LIKE

1622
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
THIS.
YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF GOT TO

1623
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
JUDGE THEM BASED ON HOW THEY

1624
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
HANDLE IT AND MOVE FORWARD.

1625
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY DOING

1626
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THAT AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE.

1627
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, GUYS.

1628
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS WAY, IF

1629
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
YOU CAN WALK AROUND HERE.

1630
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY

1631
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
CHRISTMAS TREES THAT PEOPLE HAVE

1632
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
JUST BEEN DROPPING OFF,

1633
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
CHRISTMAS TREES, AND WE SPOKE

1634
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
EARLIER TO THE FAMILY THAT

1635
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
DROPPED THIS OFF AND THE

1636
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
GENTLEMAN, THE HUSBAND IS AN

1637
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
ELECTRICIAN BY TRADE AND HE PUT

1638
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000

THERE ARE OTHER CHRISTMAS TREES

1642
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000

1643
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
THE BIG ONE OFF TO MY LEFT HERE,

1644
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THAT'S HERE EVERY YEAR, BUT THE

1645
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
SMALLER ONES ARE TO HONOR THE

1646
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
VICTIMS.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

1647
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000

1648
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000

BECAUSE?
>> I JUST WANTED COME OUT AND

1652
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
SUPPORT THE FAMILIES.

1653
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
>> Reporter: YOU COULDN'T SIT AT
HOME?

1654
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
>> NO, I COULDN'T SIT AT HOME.

1655
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I WENT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT BUT

1656
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THE TRAFFIC IS JUST TOO MUCH

1657
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
TRAFFIC DOWN THERE.

1658
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000

>> Reporter: I SAID EARLIER THAT

1662
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
PEOPLE HERE WANT TO COME OUT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO FEEL

1663
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
HELPLESS.

1664
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
DOES THIS HELP?
>> YES, IT DOES.

1665
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
IT DOES.

1666
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING THERE

1667
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
AND WATCHING IT ON THE TV.

1668
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO JUST BE

1669
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
AMONG AND TO SHOW THE SUPPORT

1670
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
AND THE LOVE THAT WE HAVE FOR

1671
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THEM.
>> Reporter: I DON'T KNOW IF

1672
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD THAT CAN

1673
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
COME OUT OF THIS, BUT IF THERE

1674
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
IS, WHAT IS IT?

1675
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
>> LIKE YOU SAID, WE DON'T KNOW

1676
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD THAT

1677
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
CAN COME OUT OF IT.

1678
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
JUST HAVE TO PRAY, PRAY FOR THE

1679
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
FAMILIES, PRAY FOR EVERYONE.

1680
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE CAN

1681
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
REALLY DO BUT PRAY.

1682
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
YOU KNOW.

1688
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR CANDLES

1689
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
AND THEY'RE LIGHTING THEM.

1690
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
DO YOU MIND IF WE TALK TO YOU?

1691
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
>> NO, ACTUALLY.

1692
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000

1694
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1695
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
>> Reporter: IT'S OKAY.
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK TO

1696
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
US, WE DON'T DO IT.

1697
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL.

1698
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
YOU SEE THEM HUGGING EACH OTHER.

1699
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THAT'S THE SENTIMENT, PEOPLE

1700
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
HUGGING AND CRYING AND PRAYING

1701
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
AND JUST SENDING WELL WISHES,

1702
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
ANDERSON, AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT

1703
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
OF THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY

1704
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
HERE.
THEY WANT TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT,

1705
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
AND, AGAIN, THEY DON'T WANT TO

1706
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
FEEL HELPLESS, THEY WANT TO FEEL

1707
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
USEFUL AND COME OUT AND SHOW HOW

1708
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
MUCH THEY LOVE THIS TOWN AND

1709
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
THAT THEY DON'T WANT THIS TOWN

1710
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THIS

1711
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
PARTICULAR TRAGEDY.

1712
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
INSTEAD, A TOWN THAT PULLED

WHAT THEY DON'T WANT LOST, WHAT

1790
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO BECOME IS

1791
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
JUST ANOTHER HEADLINE.

1792
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
THEY WANT A TRUE NATIONAL

1793
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000

GUNS AND MENTAL ILLNESS.

1796
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
HERE IS WHAT THIS GROUP TOLD US.

1797
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
>> WE LIVE IN AN INCREASINGLY

1798
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
VOUORISTIC SOCIETY THAT HAS

1799
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
BECOME MORE DISTANT FROM EACH

1800
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
OTHER ON PERSONAL AND

1801
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
INTERPERSONAL LEVEL, AND THAT'S

1802
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
HOW SOMEBODY CAN FEEL SO DISTANT

1803
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY

1804
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
COULD ACTUALLY SHOOT CHILDREN.

1805
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
>> COMMUNICATION IN THIS COUNTRY

1806
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
IS BROKEN.

1807
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, WE CANNOT

1808
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
FIND COMMON GROUND TO TALK ABOUT

1809
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
ANYTHING IT SEEMS LIKE THESE

1810
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
DAYS, AND IF THIS IS A TRIGGER

1811
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
POINT OR A TIPPING POINT FOR US

1812
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO

1813
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
ACTUALLY START TALKING TO EACH

1814
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
OTHER IN A WAY THAT'S RESPECTFUL

1815
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
AND RESULTS IN REAL CHANGE, THAT

1816
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
WOULD BE HUGE.

1817
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
>> Reporter: YOU CAN HEAR HOW

1818
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
FRUSTRATED THEY ARE.

00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
