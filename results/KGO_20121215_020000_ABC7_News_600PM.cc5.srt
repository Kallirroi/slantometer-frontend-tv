PARENTS COMING TO PICK UP THEIR

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
AND A POLICE OFFICER COME AND

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
EVERYBODY WAS A LITTLE SCARED,

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
CRYING AND I FELT ACTUALLY A
LITTLE SICK.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO THROW UP.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
>> WERE KIDS CRYING AND
SCREAMING?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
>> YES.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
KIDS WERE CRYING, NOT REALLY

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
SCREAMING, BUT THEY WERE ALL

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

ALEXIS WAS WITH HER FATHER.

US SHE WAS PUTTING OFF PICKING

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THEM UP BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE HORROR
HERE.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
>> THIS IS THE LAST FEW HOURS OF

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THEIR LIFE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000

>> YOU CAN TELL SHE LOVED HER

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
JOB, SHE LOVED THE KIDS.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
SANDY HOOK WAS A SAFE SCHOOL.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000

SHOPPING LIST AND PAYING THE

58

ONLY THREE VICTIMS WERE BROUGHT

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
TWO OF THEM DIED.

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
>> A NUMBER OF US IMAGINED WHAT

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE ON 9/11

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WHEN THERE WERE PEOPLE BRACING

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
FOR SCORES OF INJURED AND THEY
DIDN'T ARRIVE.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
>> ALL DAY LONG THE SIGHT OF

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
AMBULANCES DRIVING SLOWLY,

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
LIGHTS NOT FLASHING.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SO FEW WOUNDED TO TRY TO SAVE.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
EVEN MORE SAD, THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT SO MANY FAMILIES WHO SHOWED

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
UP TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
COULD NOT BE RE-UNITED.

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A FACT THAT IS NOT LOST ON

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ALEXIS'S MOTHER.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
>> YOU COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
EVERY DAY.

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
>> Reporter: I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY, ALEXIS.

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH.

79
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH.

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
ADDING TO THE SHOCK, THIS PLACE

81
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
IS SUCH AN UNLIKELY VENUE FOR

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
VIOLENCE, A CLASSIC, SMALL,

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
SLEEPY SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
TOWN, WHERE TONIGHT THEY'RE

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR SCRIPT AFTER

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THESE MASS SHOOTINGS, THEY'RE

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
COMING TOGETHER TO HOLD

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
CANDLELIGHT VIGILS.

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
DIANE?

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
>> ALL RIGHT, DAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
>>> AND ALL DAY LONG, OF COURSE,

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MORE ABOUT THE 20-YEAR-OLD

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SUSPECT IN THIS SHOOTING AND

BRIAN ROSS IS BACK WITH WHAT HE
KNOWS AT THIS HOUR.

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
REPORTED, THIS ALL TOOK PLACE IN

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE SMALL TOWN OF NEWTOWN,

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
CONNECTICUT, A PLACE WHERE

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
EVERYTHING IS NEARBY.

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE SPREE ENDED AT THE

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, BUT BEGAN AT

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THE LANZA FAMILY HOME.

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED THE

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SHOOTER AS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

108
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
LANZA, SEEN HERE IN A PICTURE
TAKEN SEVEN YEARS AGO AND

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
PROVIDED TO ABC NEWS BY A FAMILY

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
FRIEND WHO TOLD US ADAM WAS

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL.

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SOMETHING WE ALSO HEARD FROM A

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
NEWTOWN REAL ESTATE AGENT,

114
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
BARBARA FREY, A FAMILY FRIEND.

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> HE WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OTHER KIDS.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
MY SON PLAYED WITH HIM WHEN THEY

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WERE YOUNG.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
AND IN HER HOME, I KNOW SHE WAS
VERY PARTICULAR.

120
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I JUST THINK SHE MAYBE HAD TOO

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
HIGH A STANDARD OR SOMETHING, OR

122
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
FOCUSED TOO MUCH, FOR WHATEVER
REASON.

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> SO WAS THERE CONFLICT OR

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM?

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
>> THE PARENT AND CHILD?

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
>> YES.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF, BUT THE

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
FACT THAT THE PARENTS WERE

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
DIVORCED MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED.

130
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> THE MOTHER WAS THE FIRST TO

131
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
DIE ACCORDING TO POLICE.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ADAM'S FATHER AND BROTHER ARE

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BEING QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
IN NEW JERSEY, WHERE THEY LIVE.

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
DIANE?

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
LATEST NOW ON THOSE WHO WERE

INJURED.

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THE VICTIMS WHO ARE RECOVERING
TONIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL.

141
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FOR THAT WE GO TO AMY ROBACH WHO

142
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THEIR
STORIES.

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AMY?

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

145
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST TRAUMATIC

146
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
EVENT ANYONE AT THIS HOSPITAL

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
HAS EVER EXPERIENCED, THAT'S
WHAT I HEARD FROM A PHYSICIAN

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HERE WHO ALSO IS THE PRESIDENT

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AND CEO OF DANBURY HOSPITAL.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THE MOMENT HE

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
RECEIVED THE PHONE CALL

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
EXPECTING TWO DOZEN VICTIMS

153
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WHO WILL COME HERE REQUIRING

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE.

155
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HE AMASSED 80 DOCTORS AND

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
NURSES, THE FINEST SURGEONS
AVAILABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, AND

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THEY ONLY RECEIVED THREE INJURED

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
VICTIMS AT THIS POINT.

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THEY SAID ABOUT TEN MINUTES

161
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
LATER, THAT'S WHEN THEY REALIZED

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THAT NO MORE WERE COMING.

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HE SAID,

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THIS OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED EVERYONE

165
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WHO WAS IN THIS HOSPITAL AT THE
TIME.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ALL THE POLICE OFFICERS, THE

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
FIREFIGHTERS, THE CHILDREN

168
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
AND TEACHERS INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THE PARENTS, THERE IS NO ONE IN

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THIS COMMUNITY WHO WASN'T
AFFECTED.

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THIS MEANS THIS IS GOING TO BE A

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
COMMUNITY THAT WILL REQUIRE
MEDICAL, EMOTIONAL CARE FOR

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
YEARS TO COME.

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THEY HAVE SET UP SERVICES THAT
PEOPLE CAN ACCESS 24 HOURS A

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

176
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MOBILE LABS
SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
COMMUNITY TO HELP ANYONE WHO
FEELS A MOMENT OF CRISIS BECAUSE

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WILL DEAL

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WITH, THEY'RE BRINGING IT HOME
TO THEIR FAMILY.

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HE TOLD ME IT WAS THE SINGLE

181
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
MOST TRAUMATIC EVENT HE'S EVER

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
EXPERIENCED OR CONSIDERED IN HIS

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL LIFE.

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THOSE ARE FAIRLY WEIGHTY WORDS

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
FROM AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TO SEE ANYTHING LIKE WHAT THEY

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000

>> THANK YOU, AMY.

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000

ANCHOR CHRIS CUOMO, BECAUSE YOU

WAIT TO SEE IF THEIR CHILDREN

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
SURVIVED.

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> IMAGINE THE FIRST WORD THEY

197
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
GOT WAS THE SCHOOL WAS ON

198
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
LOCKDOWN.

199
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THEY THOUGHT THEIR KIDS WERE

200
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
MAKING GINGERBREAD HOUSES TODAY

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000

THEY RUSHED THERE, THERE'S

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
CHAOS, TO BE IMAGINED IN THESE

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SITUATIONS, BUT TO NOT KNOW FOR
SO LONG.

205
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
NOT BECAUSE OF DISARRAY, JUST

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION.

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
INSIDE ARE THE CHILDREN LIVING

208
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THROUGH THIS EVENT.

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED, THEIR

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
PARENTS HOPE SOMEDAY THEY'LL BE

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
ABLE TO FORGET.
WE SPOKE TO ONE LITTLE GIRL AND
