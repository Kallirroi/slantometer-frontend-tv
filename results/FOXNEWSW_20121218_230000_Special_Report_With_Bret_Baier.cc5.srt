102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
SIMILAR TO BOEHNER.

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE ONE OF

105

MY COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD ABOUT

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
PREFER TAX BREAKS IFER PEOPLE
UP TO $1 MILLION.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
>> BOEHNER HAS BIGGER PROBLE

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PROBLEMS.
HE HAS A BILL FOR TAX CUTS FOR

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ANYONE MAKING $250,000 OR

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
LESS.
THAT COULD HELP AVOID THE

111
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
CLIFF, SINCE THE SENATE

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
ALREADY APPROVED IT.

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
CONSERVATIVES ARE LIKELY TO

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BLOCK IT.
>> OUR JOB IS KEEP IT AS LOW

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
AS POSSIBLE NOW.

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
GET 99% OF AMERICANS NOT HAVE

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A TAX INCREASE.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAT IS GOAL.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> Reporter: MEANING WITH

THE CLOCK TICKING THE

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000

BOEHNER BOXED IN.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000

PLAN "A" OR "B" OR WHATEVER

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
PLAN "C" MIGHT BE.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BUT WE REMAIN UNITED BEHIND

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OUR PRESIDENT.

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
>> THIS IS WHAT PLAN "C" MIGHT

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
LOOK LIKE.

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THEY CAN SEE SCENARIO THAT

131
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PRESIDENT MAKES ONE MORE

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
CONCESSION, THAT THRESHOLD

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
COULD BE $500,000 FOR THE TAX

134
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
INCREASES.
BOEHNER MAY NOT TAKE IT.

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MAJOR

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SPENDING CUTS OR INCREASE IN

137
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THE DEBT CEILING.

138
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
SO THIS LEAVES A LOT ON THE

TABLE EITHER WAY.

WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THERE?

WE TALKED TO SOME MEMBERS WHO

HAVE GONE IN AND OUT.

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A COMBINATION OF CONSTERNATION

161
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND FRUSTRATION.

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TO HAPPEN.

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
JUST FINDING OUT THE DETAILS.

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT IS RIGHT NOW.

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
PROTEST OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL OF

169
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OUTSIDE GROUPS THAT THINK THAT

170
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GIVING IN

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
TOO MUCH.
IT WILL BE CALLED THE HOLD THE

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
LINE RALLY.

173
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
URGING AGAINST ANYTHING THAT

174
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WOULD COUNTER THE RATE

175
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
INCREASE.

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND REVENUE INCREASES ARE ON

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THE TABLE.

178
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
MR. BOEHNER HAS PROBLEMS WITH

179
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THE CAUCUS.

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
MOST OF THE MEMBER ARE QUIET.

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OUTSIDE GROUPS HAVE BEEN

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HARSH.

183
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
CLUB FOR GROWTH AND HAIR TAGE

184
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000

185
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SAY THAT THE SPEAKER IS OUT OF

186
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
LINE.

187
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
BUT TO THIS POINT HE HAS HAD

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE BENEFIT OF HIS LEADERSHIP

189
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000

CANTOR, WHIP, McCARTHY AND

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
RYAN BEHIND HIM.

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THAT KEPT THE REPUBLICAN

194
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
CONFERENCE TOGETHER.

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
IT COULD FRAY DEPENDING ON HOW

196
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THE VOTE GOES.

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> Bret: SPEAKER BOEHNER

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
USED THE DUAL TRAP BEFORE,

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WITH THE DEBT CEILING AND HOW

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HE ORCHESTRATED THAT

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
NEGOTIATION BACK THEN.

202
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
IF THE HOUSE GOES AHEAD WITH

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE VOTES ON THURSDAY, CARL,

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
BOEHNER'S PLAN "B" COULD

205
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
BECOME A MULTIPLE CHOICE.

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> YOU HEARD WHAT ED WHENLY

207
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE.

208
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
FIRST THE VOTE ON THE PLAN.

209
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THEY ANTICIPATE AN HOPE IT

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WILL BE DEFEATED EASILY WITH

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.

212
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
THE PLAN "B" IS THAT

213
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
MILLION-DOLLAR THRESHOLD, OPEN

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
QUESTION.

215
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THERE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE
ISSUES WITH IT.

216
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
AND PART OF THE CONSTERNATION

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THEY EXPRESS IS WHEN THE

218
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
PRESIDENT OFFERED $400,000,

219
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
WHY WOULD MR. BOEHNER TAKE SO

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
IT FAR OUT OF WHAT HAS BEEN

221
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
NARROWING NEGOTIATING PROCESS?

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
COULD IT BLOW UP ON HIM?

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THIS IS THE THING THAT IF

224
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
MR. BOEHNER DOESN'T PLAY IT

225
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
RIGHT, THERE ARE THREATS TO

226
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
HIS SPEAKERSHIP.

227
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF HOW

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
BALANCED HE COULD LOUIS EIGHT

230

VOTES FOR ELECTION OF SPEAKER

231
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
HE WOULDN'T BE IT FOR THE NEXT

232
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
UPCOMING SESSION.

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> MORE ON THIS WITH THE

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
PANEL.
WE ARE TALKING TAXES HERE BUT

235
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IT COMES DOWN TO SPENDING AS

236
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WELL.
CAPITOL HILL CONTINUES TO

237
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
WRESTLE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.

238
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OVER WHAT TO CUT, AND WHERE.

239
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND HOW MUCH, YOU HAVE TO

240
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BACK AND

241
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
FORTH IS REALLY TINY.

242
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FISCAL

243
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HOLE THE NATION IS FACING.

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
HAVE YOU WONDERED HOW MUCH OF

245
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE NATIONAL DEBT YOU AND YOUR

246
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000

SPINNING FASTER EVER YEAR.

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT BEFORE.

254
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
>> DID YOU SEE THAT CLOCK UP

255
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THERE?

256
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
$16 TRILLION OF DEBT.

257
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> USED AS PROP AT CAMPAIGN

EVENTS.

259
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> WHEN THE COME PAIN BEGAN IT

260
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WAS LESS THAN THAT.

261
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> YOU CAN WALK BY THE MAIN

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000

OF THE AMERICAS.

265
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BUT WHEN YOU REALLY STOP AND

266
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
LOOK AT IT FOR A WHILE, MAYBE

267
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
EVEN STARE AT IT, FRANKLY,

268
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
IT'S SCARY.

269
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
AS OF TODAY, EVERY HOUSEHOLD

270
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IN THE UNITED STATES OWES

271
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
$140,000 OF DEBT.

272
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD.

273
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THE U.S. BORROWED ROUGHLY

274
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
$6 BILLION EVERY DAY.

275
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE COUNTRY IS BORROWING

276
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
$239 BILLION EACH HOUR.

277
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THAT IS $4 BILLION EVERY

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
MINUTE.

279
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
IN THE TIME THAT THIS STARTED,

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
U.S. HAS ALREADY BORROWED

281
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
ANOTHER $4 MILLION.

282
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY BROUGHT

283
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
IN, IT SPENT $200.06.

284
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
IT RUNS A DEFICIT.

285
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
DEFICIT IS A ONE-YEAR

286
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
SHORTFALL THAT HAS TO BE MADE

287
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
UP BY BORROWING.

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THE NATIONAL DEBT TOTAL

289
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ACCUMULATED DEBT IS THE SUM OF

290
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
ALL THE ANNUAL DEFICITS.

291
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
LESS ANY SURPLUS.

292
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IT'S THE RUNNING COUNT.

293
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WE HEAR POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT

294
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
DEFICITS AND THE DEBT ALL THE

>> DEFICIT.

299
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> Bret: HOW TO GET

300
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
POLITICIANS TO COME TO SOME

301
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AGREEMENT TO GET THE DEBT

302
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
CLOCK SLOW DOWN OR TICK BACK

303
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THE OTHER WAY CONTINUES TO BE

304
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THE CHALLENGE.

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BUT FIRST, WHERE WE HAVE BEEN.

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
>> TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEBT

307
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THROUGH HISTORY.

308
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THE AMOUNT WE OWE EBBED AND

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FLOWED.
OVER COUNTRY OF SPENDING MORE

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THAN IT TAKES IN, IS NOTHING

311
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
NEW.

THEN CAME WORLD WAR II.

326
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
EXPENSIVE ONE.

327
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
BY "D" DAY IN 1945, THE DEBT

IT HAS CONTINUED TO RISE.

337
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WHICH LEADS US TO WHERE WE ARE

CUT IN GOVERNMENT SPENNING

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
NOT OFFERING.

933
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE

934
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
WILLING TO GO ON THE TAX CUTS

935
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
UP TO $400,000 FROM $250,000.

936
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
BEING THE CAP.

937
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
UP TO $400,000.

938
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
BUT ON A SPENDING CUT SIDE,

939
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
FROM WHAT WE HEAR, WE HAVEN'T

940
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
HEARD ANYTHING NEW.

941
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
>> ON THE REVENUE SIDE, THE

942
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
SIDES ARE CLOSE.

943
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
MY READING OF IT.

944
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
REPUBLICANS CONCEDEED THEY

945
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
WILL BE FOR RAISING TAXES.

946
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
YOU COULD FIND HILARIOUS TAPE

947
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
SOMEWHERE OF CHUCK SCHUMER AND

948
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
BARBARA BOXER, BOTH ARGUING

949
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THAT PEOPLE WHO MAKE $250,000

950
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
ARE NOT RICH.

951
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
SO BASICALLY, THE HOUSE

952
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN THE

953
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
DEMOCRATIC PLAN ON REVENUE.

954
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
ON SPENDING, HOWEVER, THERE IS

955
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
A NEW DEFINITION.

956
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WHITE HOUSE TODAY ATTACKED

957
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS FOR NOT

958
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
CUTTING AND OBAMA HAS NO

959
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
INTENTION OF AND NO PLAN TO

960
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE
GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT OR REIGN

961
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IN, ENTITLEMENT AT ALL.

962
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
REPUBLICANS KNOW.
THAT BY THE WAY, LOOK AT

963
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
DETAILS OF THE OBAMA PLAN.

964
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
A LOT OF "SAVINGS" ARE

965
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
PROJECTED REDUCTION IN

966
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
INTEREST ON THE NATIONAL DEBT.

967
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THAT IS NOT REAL.

968
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THAT IS PHONY.

969
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THEY HAVEN'T MOVED AN INCH.

970
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> Bret: TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

971
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THE DEMOCRATS AND WHAT THEY

972
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
SAID BEFORE, SENATOR

973
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
McCONNELL MENTIONED THAT THE

974
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PLAN "B" CAME OUT ABOUT THE

975
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
MILLION DOLLARS AND UP.

976
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
AND HE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE

977
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
FLOOR TODAY.

978
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
IN THE SUMMER OF 2010, SENATOR

979
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
SCHUMER SAID, "FIRST, I DON'T

980
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
KNOW A SINGLE ONE OF MY

981
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
COLLEAGUES WHO WOULDN'T PREFER

982
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TO DO TAX BREAKS FOR PEOPLE UP

983
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
TO $1 MILLION.

984
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

985
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE

986
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
PROPOSAL THAT THE HOUSE OF

987
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
REPRESENTATIVES SENT OVER TO

988
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
US LATER IN THE WEEK.

989
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
>> Bret: HARRY REID SAYING

990
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
IT HAS NO CHANCE IN THE

991
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
SENATE, CHARLES.

992
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
SO AGAIN, BACK AND FORTH AND

993
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
REPUBLICANS LOOK FOR ESCAPE

994
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
HATCH SO THEY HAVE A WAY OUT

995
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
TO KIND OF POLITICALLY BE

996
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
PROTECTED TO SAY HEY, LISTEN

997
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
WE PASS THIS.

998
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
AND IT INCLUDES TAX INCREASE

999
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
EVEN ON MILLIONAIRES.

1000
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> BOEHNER HAS GIVEN SO MUCH

1001
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
ON THE TAXATION.

1002
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HE IS REALLY AT RISK OF GOING

1003
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
OVERBOARD.
UNLESS HE HAS SERIOUS STUFF ON

1004
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
SPENNING.

1005
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THEY GOT SWINDLED ON SPENDING.

1006
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
HE SAID, IN FACT, REAGAN SAID

1007
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
HE CUT A DEAL WHERE HE RAISED

1008
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THE TAXES.
HE WAS PROMISED $3 A SPENDING

1009
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
CUT FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF TAXES

1010
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
RAISED.

1011
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
HE GOT NOTHING.

1012
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
HE SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST

1013
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
POLITICAL REGRET HE HAD.

1014
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
THIS IS THE FOOTBALL AND

1015
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
CHARLIE BROWN ALL OVER AGAIN.

1016
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BOEHNER PROBABLY MADE A

1017
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
MISTAKE CAVING ON RATES.

1018
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
BUT THAT IS DONE.

1019
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
IF HE WERE TO START ALL OVER,

1020
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVEN'T OR

1021
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SHOULD HAVE.
BUT THEY GAVEED ON RATE.

1022
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
THIS PLAN "B," REPUBLICANS IN

1023
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THE HOUSE WILL RAISE TAXES

1024
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
OVER $1 MILLION.

1025
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
WE KNOW THAT IS WHAT THE

1026
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
DEMOCRATS AND SCHUMER PROPOSED

1027
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
AND UTTER HYPOCRISY.

1028
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
THE SPEAKER'S PLAN COULD BE

1029
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
APPROACHED AND IT DOESN'T MEET

1030
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THE TEST OF PROTECTING THE

1031
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
MIDDLE CLASS.

1032
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
THINK ABOUT HOW IT YOTIC THAT

1033
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
IS.

1034
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
THAT PROTECTS THE MIDDLE CLASS

1035
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
AND EVERYBODY UP TO

1036
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
$1 MILLION.

1037
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
BUT HE SAYS IT CAN'T PROTECT

1038
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE THE

1039
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
DEMOCRATS WILL REJECT IT, SO

1040
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
NOT ENABLE IT TO PROTECT THE

1041
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
MIDDLE CLASS.

1042
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
THIS ISN'T ENOUGH.

1043
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
IF YOU HAVE TO SAY STUFF LIKE

1044
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THAT.

1045
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
>> THE SENATE WOULD SHOOT IT

1046
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
DOWN FOR POLITICS.

1047
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
BUT IT WOULD PROTECT MIDDLE

1048
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
CLASS BECAUSE THE TAXES

1049
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
WOULDN'T GET RAISED AND IT

1050
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
WOULD BE RAISED ON THOSE

1051
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
MAKING --

1052
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
>> OVER $1 MILLION.
BUT THE ARGUMENT IS IT'S NOT

1053
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
GOING TO HELP THE MIDDLE

1054
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
CLASS, BECAUSE WE'LL KILL IT

1055
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
BEFORE IT HELPS THE MIDDLE

1056
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
CLASS.

1057
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
>> Bret: SO DOESN'T THAT, IF

1058
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
THE REPUBLICANS THEN VOTE THIS

1059
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
THROUGH, DOESN'T THAT PUT ONUS

1060
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ON THE WHITE HOUSE?

1061
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
>> YES.
THEY WILL PUT THE DEMOCRATS ON

1062
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
THE DEFENSIVE.

1063
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
>> CAN BOEHNER GET 218 VOTES

1064
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
ON --
>> THAT IS WHAT TODAY IS

1065
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
ABOUT.

1066
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
THEY HOPE TO DO IT BY

1067
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
THURSDAY.

1068
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WON'T HELP

1069
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
HIM.

1070
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO SAY WE

1071
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
DIDN'T WANTBE TO GO OVER THE

1072
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
CLIFF.
HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS.

1073
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
NOT GOING TO GIVE ENTITLEMENT.

1074
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
BIG FIGHT FOR JANUARY AND PUT

1075
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
ONUS ON THE PRESIDENT.

1076
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
>> CAN CONSERVATIVES SAY OKAY,

1077
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
WELL --

1078
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>> KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS NOT

1079
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
JUST INCOME.

1080
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
CAPITAL GAIN AND DIVIDENDS

1081
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
SNORE BUT CAN HE CONVINCE THEM

1082
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
HAVE THE BATTLE IN THE NEW

1083
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
YEAR, USE THE DEBT CEILING AS

1084
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
LEVERAGE AND SPENDING CUT.

1085
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
>> REPLACING THE COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN IS A SIGN THAT HE HAS

1086
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
PRETTY GOOD CONTROL OF THE

1087
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
CAUCUS I SAY.

1088
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, EVERY TIME

1089
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
YOU GO UP THE HILL YOU HEAR

1090
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
GROUSING ABOUT THE SPEAKER.

1091
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
BITTER GROUSING FROM

1092
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
CONSERVATIVES.

1093
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
>> GIVEN A DEAL WHERE OBAMA

1094
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
OFFERS NOTHING ON SPENDING OR

1095
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PLAN "B" WHERE YOU PASS TAX

1096
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
INCREASE FOR $1 MILLION, YOU

1097
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
HAVE TO GO TO PLAN "B."

1098
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
MUCH SMART EVERY OPTION.

1099
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
PLAN "A" IS ABSURD.

1100
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
>> Bret: THREE CHOICES DOWN

1101
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THE ROW.

1102
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
DEAL, PLAN "B" OR OVER THE

1103
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
CLIFF?

1104
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> OVER THE CLIFF.

1105
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> I THINK IT'S LIKELY PLAN

1106
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
"B."

1107
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
SMALL HOPE FOR PLAN "A."

1108
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
>> IF YOU THINK THE FEDERAL

1109
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
GOVERNMENT CONSUMES LARGE

1110
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
PROPORTION OF GDP YOU ARE OVER

1111
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THE CLIFF.

1112
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
>> Bret: WHAT ARE YOU

1113
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
PREDICTING?

1114
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
