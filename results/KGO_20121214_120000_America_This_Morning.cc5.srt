AS THE DOMINOS FALL, THERE'S AN

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
INTERESTING POLITICAL ANGLE.

SECRETARY OF STATE.

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
BUT HE MAY FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ABOUT HIS PAST SUPPORT OF SYRIAN
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD.

128

WEBSITE REPORTS THEY WERE JOKING

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IT WAS NICE OF THE NORTH KOREANS

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
TO DELAY THE LAUNCH SO THE PARTY

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTED.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, HOWEVER,

DENIES THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT OFF

QUICKLY.

157
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
BUT REPUBLICANS SAY THE BILL IS

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
LOADED WITH MANY THINGS THAT

159
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
