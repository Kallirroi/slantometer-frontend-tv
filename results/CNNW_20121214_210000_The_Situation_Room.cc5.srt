1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
AT 9:30 OR SO THIS MORNING,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
SHOTS RANG OUT AS AT LEAST ONE

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
GUNMAN ENTERED THAT SCHOOL AND

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
THAT GUNMAN IS DEAD.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
AS POLICE HAVE BEEN TELLING US

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
NOW, 20 CHILDREN DEAD, 18 OF

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THEM DEAD AT THE SCENE.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, SIX

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ADULTS ARE ALSO DEAD, INCLUDING

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YET ANOTHER

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ADULT WAS FOUND DEAD AT ANOTHER

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
LOCATION THAT POLICE ARE NOT

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
OFFICIALLY DISCLOSING AS OF YET.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHER

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
OF THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER, WHO IS

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
ALSO DEAD AT THE SCENE, WAS ALSO

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
KILLED.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
SHE IS A TEACHER AND SHE WAS

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ALSO KILLED AT THAT SCHOOL,

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
ACCORDING TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
SOURCES.
IN ADDITION TO THIS, WE ARE ALSO

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
TOLD BY OUR SOURCES THAT ANOTHER

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
PERSON IS BEING QUESTIONED AT

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
THIS TIME BUT IS NOT BEING

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
CALLED A SUSPECT RIGHT NOW, AND

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
ALSO THAT PERSON IS NOT BEING

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
IDENTIFIED, WOLF.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
SO WHILE THE SCHOOL IS BEING

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
CALLED SECURE AND SAFE BY LAW

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES RIGHT

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
NOW, THEY ARE -- THEY STILL HAVE

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A LOT OF INVESTIGATING TO DO.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
THEY HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
RELEASED THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
OR THE OTHER PERSON BEING

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
QUESTIONED OR THE NAMES OF ANY

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
OF THE VICTIMS AT THIS TIME.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
IT'S JUST AN AWFUL SCENE, AND

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
PARENTS FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS,

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WOLF, WHEN THEY RECEIVED A LOT

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OF THEM TEXT MESSAGES, ALERTS

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
FROM THE SCHOOL THAT HAD THEM

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
RUSHING OVER TO THE SCHOOL AS A

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
911 CALL CAME IN.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE,

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
THEY TRIED TO SECURE THE SCENE

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
AND MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
SO THAT ALL THE CHILDREN WERE

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
IMMEDIATELY EVACUATED FROM THE
SCHOOL AND BROUGHT TO A SAFE

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
LOCATION NEARBY WHERE THEY COULD

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
BE REUNITED WITH THEIR PARENTS.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WE KNOW THIS ONE THING FROM THE

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
SHOOTER.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT LEAST
THREE WEAPONS WERE FOUND AT THE

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SCENE.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ONE OF THEM A GLOCK, ONE OF THEM

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A SIG SAUER AND ONE OF THEM A

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
223 BUSHMASTER.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT KIND

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OF MODELS BUT WE HAVE THAT AS

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WELL.

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
AND HERE'S MORE ABOUT HOW IT ALL

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CAME DOWN FROM START TO FINISH.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THESE CONNECTICUT PARENTS HAD

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
DROPPED OFF THEIR KIDS FOR A

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
TYPICAL FRIDAY AT SCHOOL.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THEN ABOUT 9:30 IN THE MORNING,

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THEY RECEIVED ROBO CALLS AND

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TEXT MESSAGES.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
PUT ON ALERT.

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
>> I JUST GOT A MESSAGE

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
SAYING -- FROM THE

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SUPERINTENDENT THAT THERE WAS --

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THERE WAS AN UNCONFIRMED

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SHOOTING AND, YOU KNOW,

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
EVERYBODY IS IN LOCK DOWN.

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
>> I WAS A LITTLE SCARED.

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I FELT SICK TO MY STOMACH.

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
>> Reporter: A GUNMAN WAS FIRING

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AWAY AS TEACHERS WENT INTO

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
LOCKDOWN AND PARENTS RUSHED TO

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THE SCENE.
>> I HEARD SCREAMING.

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
AND SO WE -- WE WENT -- LIKE WE

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WENT TO THE WALL AND WE SAT DOWN

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AND THEN POLICE CAME IN.

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IT'S LIKE IS HE IN HERE?

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THEN HE RAN OUT.

90
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THEN OUR TEACHER -- THEN

91
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SOMEBODY YELLED GET TO A SAFE

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
PLACE.

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
>> INSIDE, CHILDREN WERE HIDING

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AS A GUNMAN FIRED AWAY.

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
>> THEY WERE CRYIN IN THE

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
CLOSET.

97
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
IN THE CLOSET OF THE ART ROOM.

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AND EVENTUALLY, THEY WERE

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
LEAVING AND WHEN THEY WERE

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
LEAVING, THE POLICE MADE THEM

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
HOLD HANDS.

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THE POLICE TOLD THEM TO CLOSE

103
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THEIR EYES.
>> TOLD TO KEEP THEIR EYES

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
CLOSED BECAUSE A GUNMAN WAS ON A

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
KILLING SPREE, KILLING THE

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
PRINCIPAL, A COUNSELOR, CHILD

107
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
AFTER CHILD.

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
>> ON AND OFF DUTY TROOPERS

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
RESPONDED TO THE SCHOOL.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THAT INCLUDED CHECKING EVERY

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
DOOR, EVERY CRACK, EVERY

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
CREVICE, EVERY PORTION OF THAT

113
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SCHOOL.
>> Reporter: AND AGAIN, OUR

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALL OF

115
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THIS HAPPENED IN ONE PARTICULAR

116
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
AREA OF THE SCHOOL, JUST ONE

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AREA OF THE SCHOOL WHERE ALL THE

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SHOOTING OCCURRED, ACCORDING TO

119
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
POLICE, IN TWO ROOMS.

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THEY MAY BE TWO CLASSROOMS.

121
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE

122
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SHOOTER, WOLF, WAS FOUND DEAD IN

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ONE OF THOSE CLASSROOMS AS WELL.

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS, A LOT OF

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
HEARTACHE AND PEOPLE WALKING

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AROUND THIS SMALL TOWN NOW IN

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
CONNECTICUT, NEWTOWN,

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
CONNECTICUT, IT'S SO HARD FOR

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THEM TO BELIEVE AND TO

130
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

131
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
BACK TO YOU.

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THEY HAVEN'T SAID OFFICIALLY

133
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THAT THE SHOOTER WOUND UP

134
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
KILLING HIMSELF, HAVE THEY?

135
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE NOT.

136
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THEY HAVE NOT REVEALED THAT.

137
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THEY HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY

138
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
RELEASED THE SHOOTER'S NAME

139
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
EITHER.
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND, REMEMBER,

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THERE IS ANOTHER ADULT AT

141
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ANOTHER LOCATION WHO WAS ALSO

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
FOUND DEAD AND WE BELIEVE THAT

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THAT HAS SOME CONNECTION TO THE

144
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE, AND YET

145
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SOMEONE ELSE WAS ALSO BEING

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
QUESTIONED.

147
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SO THIS INVESTIGATION IS FAR

148
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
FROM OVER.

149
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
THERE IS A WARRANT BEING SERVED

150
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AT THE PLACE WHERE THE SUSPECT

151
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LIVED WITH SOMEONE ELSE, WHO WAS

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING.

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AND SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS, OF

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
COURSE, AS WE ALL HAVE AT THIS

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TIME TO FIND OUT HOW THIS

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
HAPPENED AND, WOLF, WHY THIS

157
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
HAPPENED.
>> MANY QUESTIONS THAT LAW

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ENFORCEMENT WILL BE

159
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
INVESTIGATING.
SUSAN, STAND BY.

160
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
JOINING US ON THE PHONE RIGHT

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
NOW IS LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE, A

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SPOKESMAN FOR THE CONNECTICUT

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
STATE POLICE.

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HE'S IN NEWTOWN HIMSELF.

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE

166
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ANSWERS, LIEUTENANT, AND YOU

167
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
MUST BE OVERWHELMED RIGHT NOW.

168
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
BUT FIRST OF ALL, CAN YOU

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
IDENTIFY THE SHOOTER IN THIS

170
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
PARTICULAR CASE?

171
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
CAN YOU GIVE US THAT PERSON'S

172
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
NAME?

173
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> WOLF, WE DO HAVE A TENTATIVE

174
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
IDENTIFICATION, BUT FOR

175
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
INVESTIGATIVE REASONS WE'RE

176
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HOLDING BACK THAT INFORMATION

177
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES.

178
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
YOU ARE CORRECT IN SAYING THAT

179
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
THERE IS A SECONDARY SCENE IN

180
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
NEWTOWN AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL AT

181
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A PRIVATE HOME WHERE THERE'S

182
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ANOTHER DECEASED ADULT THAT MAY

183
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
BE RELATED TO THIS.

184
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
JUST FOR INVESTIGATORY REASONS,

185
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
WE'RE HOLDING BACK THAT IDENTITY

186
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
RIGHT AT THIS TIME.
>> CAN YOU TELL US IF THE

187
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
SHOOTER DID HAVE A CONNECTION,

188
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THOUGH, TO THE SCHOOL?

189
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

190
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SPECULATION THAT THE SHOOTER'S

191
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MOTHER, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS A

192
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
TEACHER INSIDE ONE OF THOSE

193
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
CLASSROOMS.

194
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
>> WE NEED TO, AGAIN, BE

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN RELEASING

196
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THAT INFORMATION.

197
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING, I

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WOULD SAY, WITHIN THE NEXT THREE

199
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
OR FOUR HOURS BUT AT THIS TIME

200
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT AT

201
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ALL.

202
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
>> IS THERE ANOTHER SUSPECT ON

203
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE LOOSE RIGHT NOW?

204
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE

205
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WE ARE GETTING CONFLICTING
INDICATIONS.

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> IN THE FASHION OF WHAT

207
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OCCURRED AS FAR AS THIS SHOOTER

208
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IS CONCERNED, I MEAN WE ARE

209
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TALKING TO EVERYONE WHO POSSIBLY

210
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH HIM

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WHATSOEVER.

212
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WE HAD TO OBTAIN SEARCH WARRANTS

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TO SEARCH HIS RESIDENCE AND

214
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND I

215
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
INTERVIEWED FRIENDS AND

216
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
RELATIVES AND WE ARE REALLY

217
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ENSURING OR MAKING SURE THAT WE

218
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED INTO THE

219
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BACKGROUND OF THIS INDIVIDUAL.

220
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
>> TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NUMBERS

221
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THAT WE RECEIVED ARE PRECISE, 26

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
PEOPLE WERE SHOT AND 20 WERE

223
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
CHILDREN.
THE SHOOTER HIMSELF, DO WE

224
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SUSPECT HE KILLED HIMSELF?

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> THAT WILL BE DWRMED BY THE

226
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER.

227
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE WAS NO

228
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCHARGE OF

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WEAPONRY.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHEN THE

230
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
CALL CAME IN, NEWTOWN POLICE

231
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
OFFICERS ALL RESPONDED

232
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IMMEDIATELY AND UPON ARRIVAL

233
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WENT IN WITH TACTICAL INJURY.

234
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
IMMEDIATELY ENTERED THE SCHOOL

235
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
AND BEGAN SEARCHING EVERY NOOK

236
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AND CRANNY TO PERFORM A RESCUE

237
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OF THE STUDENTS AND STAFF WE

238
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
POSSIBLY COULD.

239
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WE DID ACCOMPLISH THAT TASK, BUT

240
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ENCOUNTERED AS YOU SAID THE

241
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
DECEASED STUDENTS WHICH NUMBERED

242
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
18 IN THE SCHOOL AND TWO WERE

243
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
TRANSPORT AND PRONOUNCED DEAD

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND SIX ADULTS WERE PRONOUNCED

245
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
DEAD AT THE SCENE AND THEN THE

246
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SECONDARY SENIOR WHICH WAS

247
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
ANOTHER ADULT.

248
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS

249
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SCENE IF THERE WAS A CONNECTION

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
BETWEEN THE SHOOTER AND THE

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PERSON WHO WAS DEAD?

252
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>> IT'S ALL PRELIMINARY.

253
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I AM DIRECTING 99% OF MY

254
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOL.

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THERE IS A

256
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
GREAT DEAL GOING ON TRYING TO

257
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
KEEP FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
RELATIVES INFORMED AS FAR AS

259
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WHAT WE KNOW.

260
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WE CERTAINLY DISCOVERED THAT

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SCENE IN CONCERT WITH THIS

262
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
INVESTIGATION AS I WAS SAYING.

263
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WE DID A LOT OF WORK WE HAVE ALL

264
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
RELATED AREAS.

265
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> IN NEWTOWN ITSELF IN THIS

266
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
VICINITY IN THAT SMALLTOWN.

267
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> IT'S A SMALLTOWN.

268
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
IT'S NOT FAR AWAY.

269
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I WOULD BE CONDIT WITH YOU.

270
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
IT WAS IN A RESIDENCE RIGHT HERE

271
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
IN THE TOWN.

272
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THE SECONDARY SCENE WAS LOCATED

273
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
BY TROOPERS.

274
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
>> WE HAVE ONE CRIME SCENE AT

275
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THE SCHOOL AND ANOTHER

276
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
INDIVIDUAL IS DEAD.

277
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ARE THERE OTHERS THAT YOU ARE

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
SEARCHING OR LOOKING AT?

279
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

280
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
PERSONNEL HERE.

281
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WE BROUGHT IN NOT JUST CRIME

282
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
TEAM, BUT ANOTHER.

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
WE ARE RESPONDING AND CHECK

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING THAT

285
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
COULD POSSIBLY BE RELATED TO THE

286
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
TRAGEDY PARTICIPATING HERE.

287
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
JOHN KING IS HERE WITH US HERE

288
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AT CNN AND HAS A QUESTION HE

289
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WANTS TO ASK.

290
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
>> LIEUTENANT, I KNOW YOUR

291
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OFFICERS ARE COLLECTING EVIDENCE

292
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AT THE SCENE.

293
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WHAT IS YOUR PRELIMINARY

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY SHOTS WERE

295
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
FIRED IN THE SCHOOL?

296
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
>> THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

297
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I WOULDN'T EVEN VENTURE A GUESS

298
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
QUITE FRANKLY.

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT

300
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
WITH SEVERAL SYSTEMS OF CHECKS

301
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AND BALANCES.

302
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
ONE CERTAINLY BEING A MEDICAL

303
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
EXAMINATION OF THE DECEASED AND

304
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
COLLECTING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND

305
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SHELLS AND EXAMINING THE

306
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WEAPONRY AND COLLECTING ANY

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
BULLETS THAT HAVE BEEN RANDOMLY

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SHOT.
IT WILL BE A LONG PROCESS BEFORE

309
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
WE CAN GUESTIMATE THAT QUESTION.

310
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> I KNOW YOU ARE MAKING SURE

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
YOU CHECKED EVERY BOX, BUT IS IT

312
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

313
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SHOOTER CAME WITH A PRIMARY

314
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
TARGET ARMED FOR A MASS KILLING

315
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
AND CAME FOR A PRIMARY TARGET

316
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND SOURCES SAID THAT WAS HIS

317
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MOTHER.

318
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION

319
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BECAUSE THE INFORMATION HAS NOT

320
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BEEN PROVIDED AS OF YET.

321
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> WERE THERE EXPLOSIVES

322
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO THE

323
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
WEAPONS?
>> NO.

324
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE

325
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ONCE THE SCENE WAS SECURE, WE

326
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
REALIZED THE TACTICAL TEAM WILL

327
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
CHECK THE SITES AND THE VEHICLES

328
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

329
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SHOOTER TO ENSURE THAT THERE

330
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WERE IN FACT NO EXPLOSIVES OR NO

331
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
OTHER ISSUES NEEDED TO ENGAGE.

332
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
>> DID THE SHOOTER IN ADDITION

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
COMING IN WITH THESE WEAPONS

334
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
ALSO HAVE -- WAS HE DRESSED IN

335
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ARMOR AND DID HE HAVE PROTECTION

336
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
FOR HIMSELF?

337
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

338
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THAT.
>> HE WAS OBVIOUSLY FOUND

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
DEAD-ON THE SCENE AND NO OTHER

340
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT CAME IN TO

341
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
KILL ANYONE.

342
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
PRESUMABLY THIS INDIVIDUAL WOUND

343
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
UP KILLING HIMSELF, BUT YOU

344
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
CAN'T CONFIRM THAT YET.

345
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

346
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

347
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT'S A GOOD ASSESSMENT AS TO

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR.

349
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> JOHN HAS ONE MORE QUESTION.

350
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> WE ARE TOLD THAT THE SECOND

351
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
SCENE THAT THE NEIGHBORS WERE

352
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
EVACUATEED FROM THEIR HOMES

353
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
AROUND THE HOME, WAS THAT AS A

354
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
PRECAUTION OR DO YOU HAVE AN

355
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
INDICATION OR CONCERN THAT THERE

356
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HEAVY WEAPONS OR EXPLOSIVES?

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
>> IT'S A PROCEDURE OF WHAT WE

358
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
DO AND WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS

359
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
AND ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
WE EVACUATED THE NEIGHBORS IN

361
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THE EVENT THAT THERE WAS

362
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ANYTHING THAT WAS HARMFUL AS WE

363
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
BEGIN TO EXAMINE THE SCENE.

364
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
>> WAS THIS PERSON A KNOWN

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
PERSON OF CONCERN TO LOCAL LAW

366
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
ENFORCEMENT OR WHEN YOU FOUND

367
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
OUT HIS IDENTIFICATION, YOU ARE

368
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
NOT RELEASING IT AND WHEN YOU

369
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
FOUND IT OUT, WAS IT A TOTAL

370
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SURPRISE?

371
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
HISTORY AND THAT'S SOMETHING

373
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THAT THE DETECTIVES WILL LOOK AT

374
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
AS THEY CONTINUE THE EXAMINATION

375
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
OF THE ENTIRE CASE AND WE WILL

376
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
MAKE IT A POINT TO KNOW HIS

377
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
HISTORY.
EVERYTHING THAT WE WILL DO IN

378
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THIS CASE.

379
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
>> WHEN ARE YOU RELEASE THE

380
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
NUMBERS, LIEUTENANT, ONE THING

381
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
IN ADDITION TO THE HUGE NUMBER,

382
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
26 PEOPLE KILLED AND 20 OF THEM

383
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
CHILDREN.
YOU POINTED OUT THAT ONE PERSON

384
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
WAS INJURED.
ONLY ONE INJURY.

385
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU THAT

386
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
26 PEOPLE WERE SHOT AND KILLED

387
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
AND ONLY ONE PERSON INJURED?

388
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
>> TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, THIS IS A

389
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
VERY, VERY TRAGIC SCENE FOR

390
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
EVERYBODY.
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

391
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT HAD TO

393
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
GO TO THE SCHOOL AND SEE THE

394
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
CARNAGE AND THE DEATHS THIS TIME

395
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
OF YEAR, I CAN ALMOST HAVETIME.

396
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE.

397
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
>> WHAT A HORRIFIC STORY.

398
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE, THANKS SO MUCH

THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

401
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WORLD.

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THE STORY UNFORTUNATELY IS SO HO

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
HISK O RISK, BUT PEOPLE ALL OVER

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BEGINNING TO GET THE BEGINNING

407
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
OF THIS INFORMATION.

408
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE IS WITH

409
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

410
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LIEUTENANT.

411
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
JOINING US NOW ON THE PHONE IS A

412
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
PARENT AS WELL.
TELL US WHERE YOU WERE AND WHAT

413
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
WAS GOING ON.

414
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
YOUR CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

415
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS A THIRD GRADER

416
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AND SHE WAS THERE ACTUALLY IN

417
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
HER READING CLASS.

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THEY HEARD BANGS AND THANK GOD

419
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
FOR MRS. SUMMERS.

420
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
HER READING TEACHER GRABBED MY

421
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
DAUGHTER AND BROUGHT HER INTO A

422
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
BATHROOM.
SHE LOCKED THE DOOR ALONG WITH

423
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
ANOTHER TEACHER.

424
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
IN A SHORT TIME, SOME POLICE

425
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
WERE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT OF

426
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THERE AND ESCORT THEM THROUGH

427
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THE HALL WAYS.

428
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A MESSY

429
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
SCENE FOR MY DAUGHTER.

430
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> I SPOKE WITH YOUR WIFE, LISA

431
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
AND SHE SAID YOUR DAUGHTER SEEMS

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
TO BE OKAY.
YOU ALSO HAVE A 10-YEAR-OLD SON.

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
HOW ARE THE KIDS DOING NOW?

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF MY DAUGHTER

435
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
IS IN SHOCK OR NOT, BUT FROM

436
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
WHAT SHE TOLD ME SHE SAW, SHE IS

437
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
DOING INCREDIBLY WELL.

438
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
MY SON IS DOING GREAT TOO, BUT

439
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FEARS.

440
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
THE GAME IS CHANGED FROM THIS

441
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
POINT ON.

442
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
PER ARE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHEN

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
YOU SAY THE GAME IS CHANGED.

444
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> MY KIDS ARE ASKING WHEN IS IT

445
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

446
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
IT WAS ONLY A WEEK AGO WE WERE

447
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SITUATION AND I SAID THE CHANCES

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
OF IT HAPPENING ARE ONE IN A

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
ZILLION AT SANDY HOOK.

451
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT.

452
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
>> WE KNOW YOU KNEW THE

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
PRINCIPAL, DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WHO

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WAS KILLED IN THE MASS MURDER

455
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
TODAY.
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER.

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
>> SHE WAS JUST SO NICE AND SHE

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
LOVED HER JOB.
ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS SHE

458
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WENT OUT OF HER WAY JUST TO HELP

459
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
US WITH CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WERE WORKING ON WITH OUR

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
DAUGHTER.

462
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THIS IS ALL SO SURREAL SO

463
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FORGIVE ME IF I AM CLOUDY.

464
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> WE APPRECIATE IT AND CAN'T

465
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
IMAGINE WHAT YOU ARE GOING

466
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
THROUGH.

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
JOHN KING HAS A QUESTION.

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> SADLY IN ANY COMMUNITY WHEN

469
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS HAPPENS, THERE

470
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS AND HOW

471
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
SPECIFIC WAS THAT INFORMATION

472
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
AND OBVIOUSLY THE OFFICIALS AT

473
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THE SCHOOL WERE DEALING WITH A

474
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
TRAGEDY.
DO YOU THINK THAT PART WAS

475
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
HANDLED APPROPRIATELY?

476
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> I THINK THEY DID THE BEST

477
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THEY COULD DO.

478
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PREPARE FOR

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
SOMETHING THIS CRAZY.

480
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
MY WIFE CALLED ME.

481
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I WORK IN NEW YORK AND MY WIFE

482
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
TOLD ME THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I RUSHED HOME.

484
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
MY WIFE WAS ALREADY IN TOWN.

485
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
SO FAR THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL SYSTEM

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
HAS BEEN GREAT IN LEAVING

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AUTOMATIC PHONE UPDATES WITH THE

488
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
PARENTS.

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
>> A SAD STORY.

490
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
QUICK QUESTION BEFORE I LET YOU

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
GO.

492
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
AT SOME POINT YOU WILL HAVE TO

493
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT LETTING

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
YOUR KIDS GO BACK TO SANDY HOOK

495
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

496
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> THIS IS ALL SO NEW.

497
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MY KIDS

498
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
AND EXPLAINING THIS IS WHAT

499
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
HAPPENED.
YOU DO YOUR BEST TO COMMUNICATE

500
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
WITH THEM AND DO YOUR BEST TO --

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
IT'S FUNNY THAT A BOMB HITS AND

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THERE IS A LOT OF SMOKE AND IT'S

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
STILL HERE.

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
REALLY PLAN, BUT HOPEFULLY BY

506
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THE TIME THEY GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

507
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I WILL HAVE DONE A GOOD ENOUGH

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
JOB OF MAKING THEM FEEL AS

509
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
COMFORTABLE AS THEY CAN BE.

510
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
>> HOW IS YOUR WIFE DOING?

511
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
>> SHE IS HANGING IN THERE.

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> GIVE ALL OF THEM OUR LOVE AND

513
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT.

514
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WE WISH THEM ONLY THE BEST.

515
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THIS IS A PARENT OF THE KIDS

516
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
FROM THAT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
SCHOOL.

518
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
THE KIDS GOT OUT OKAY, BUT

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
OBVIOUSLY 20 OTHER CHILDREN DID

520
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
NOT GET OUT OKAY.

521
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
18 OF THEM DIED ON THE SCENE AND

522
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
TWO OTHERS DIED AT THE HOSPITAL

523
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
AS A RESULT OF THE INJURIES.

524
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
>> I THINK A REMARKABLE

525
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
CONVERSATION DEALING WITH THE

526
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
UNTHINKABLE IN TRYING TO EXPLAIN

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
TO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE

528
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON THAT THE

529
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED IN THEIR

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SCHOOL AND FOR MANY OF THE

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
CHILDREN WHEN THEY GO BACK, MANY

532
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OF THEIR FRIENDS WON'T BE THERE.

533
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IT'S A TOUGH TASK FOR THE

534
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
PARENTS.
I WANTED TO WRAP UP THE

535
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
CONVERSATION AND UNDERSTANDABLY

536
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
YOU COVERED STORIES LIKE THIS IN

537
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THE PAST.

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THE POLICE ARE BEING CAREFUL

539
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
WHAT THEY SAY AND I WANTED TO

540
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
GIVE YOU MORE OF THE INFORMATION

541
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I HAVE.
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

542
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
OFFICIALS BASED ON INFORMATION

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
FROM THEIR PEOPLE ON THE SCENE

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
AND THE STATE POLICE ON THE

545
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
SCENE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SHOOTER SHOWED UP WITH THE

547
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
INTENT OF OBVIOUSLY ARMED FOR A

548
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
MASS KILLING, BUT THEY BELIEVE

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
HIS MOTHER, A TEACHER THERE WAS

550
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THE PRIMARY TARGET AND MOST OF

551
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THE DEVASTATION HAPPENED IN AND

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AROUND HER CLASSROOM AT THE

553
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SCHOOL.

554
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
THAT IS THE THEORY THEY ARE

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
OPERATING UNDER AS THEY COLLECT

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THE EVIDENCE IN THE SCENE AND

557
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THEY FOUND A FAMILY MEMBER SLAIN

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
AT THE SECOND SITE IN NEWTOWN

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
AND THEY ARE INTERVIEWING

560
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
FRIENDS AND ROOMMATES AS THEY

561
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
TRY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER.

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THEIR BELIEF AT THIS POINT IS HE

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL AND WENT

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
DIRECTLY TOWARDS AND TO HER

565
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
CLASSROOM AND MOST OF THE

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
KILLING WAS DONE IN THAT AREA.

567
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
>> THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
RIGHT THERE.

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THEY FOUND THREE WEAPONS, IS

570
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THAT RIGHT?

571
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THESE ARE PRETTY SOPHISTICATED

572
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WEAPONS THEY FOUND.

573
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THESE NUMBERS, 26

574
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PEOPLE KILL AND 20 OF THEM

575
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
CHILDREN AND ONE INJURED.

576
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

577
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
PEOPLE ARE KILLED, THERE IS A

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

579
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
LOOKS LIKE THIS PERSON WANTED TO

580
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
EXECUTE THIS PERSON.

581
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I WAS TOLD THAT THE NUMBER OF

582
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SPENT SHELLS WERE MIND-NUMBING.

583
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WHEN THE GUNMAN OPENED FIRE, IT

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WAS IN A CONCENTRATED AREA.

585
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
HE WAS IN THE IN THE HALLS.

586
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
IN AND AROUND HIS MOTHER'S

587
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
CLASSROOM, BUT THAT HE JUST KEPT

588
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
FIRING.
>> HE A LOT OF ROUNDS.

589
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
SOME OF THE EYEWITNESSS WERE

590
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
TELLING US THEY HEARD BOOM,

591
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

592
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
NEVER ENDING WHAT THEY HEARD

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
COMING FROM THE MIDDLE

594
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
CLASSROOMS.
>> THE NUMBER OF SHOTS FIRED

595
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT I THINK IS THE REASON WHY

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
YOU DON'T HAVE FIVE, SIX, 15

597
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
PEOPLE TREATED AT THE HOSPITAL.

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
IT'S A LOW NUMBER.

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATION.

600
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
>> MARY SNOW IS ON THE SCENE IN

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

602
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE SHOOTER'S

603
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
MOTHER'S HOME WE RESPECT IN

604
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
NEWTOWN, IS THAT RIGHT?

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.

606
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
YOU ARE TALKING TO LIEUTENANT

607
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
VANCE OF THE CONNECTICUT STATE

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
POLICE.

609
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
PRESUMABLY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
THIS SCENE.

611
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
POLICE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS

612
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
NOW.

613
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
SEVERAL HOURS.
JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, WE SAW A

614
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
S.W.A.T. TEAM LEAVING THE SCENE.

615
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.

616
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
NOT ONLY TO US, BUT TO RESIDENTS

617
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
WHO CAN'T GO INTO THE HOMES.

618
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
WE DID ALSO SEE AN AMBULANCE

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
LEAVING THE SCENE ABOUT 3:15 AND

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
POLICE ARE BEING TIGHT-LIPPED

621
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
HERE ABOUT THE LOCATION WHERE

622
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THEY ARE.

623
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WE CAN YOU FROM RESIDENTS, ONE

624
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
WHO LIVED NEAR THE SUSPECT'S

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
MOTHER SAID THAT POLICE CAME IN

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
AT ABOUT 11:00 TO HER HOME AND

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
TOLD HERSHEY NEEDED TO GET OUT

628
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
RIGHT AWAY.

629
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
AT ONE POINT SHE WAS ESCORTED

630
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
BACK TO HER HOUSE AND TOLD SHE

631
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
HAD TO LEAVE AGAIN.

632
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
THERE IS NO TIME TABLE BEING

633
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
GIVEN TO THE RESIDENTS ABOUT

634
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
WHEN THEY CAN REENTER THEIR

635
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
HOMES.
MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES

636
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
ARE AT THIS SCENE AND IN TERMS

637
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
OF WHAT NEIGHBORS ARE SAYING,

638
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
THESE HOMES ARE FAR APART.

639
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WE HAVEN'T FOUND MANY NEIGHBORS

640
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
WHO KNEW THE SUSPECT OR HIS

641
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
MOTHER, BUT WE REACHED ONE WOMAN

642
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
WHO JUST DESCRIBED THE SUSPECT

643
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
AT TROUBLED AND SAYING THE

644
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
PARENTS WERE DIVORCE AND DIDN'T

645
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT.

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THIS COMMUNITY IS SO SHAKEN TO

647
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
THE CORE AND FILLING UP WITH

648
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
TEARS ANY TIME YOU APPROACH THEM

649
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
SAYING SO MANY YOUNG CHILDREN

650
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
ARE IN THE COMMUNITY.

651
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
>> THIS IS A SMALL COMMUNITY.

652
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
TO SET THE SCENE, ONLY ABOUT 80

653
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
MILES FROM NEW YORK CITY AND 40

654
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
MILES OR SO FROM HARTFORD.

655
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
UNDER 2,000 PEOPLE LIVE IN

656
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
NEWTOWN.

657
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY NOT FAR

658
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
FROM DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

659
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
PEACEFUL AND WONDERFUL PLACE

660
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WHERE WE HEARD FROM A LOST

661
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
INDIVIDUALS WITH FAMILIES WHO

662
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
MOVED THERE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

663
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
SYSTEM IS CONSIDERED EXCELLENT

664
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THERE AND DESPITE THE SANDY HOOK

665
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN

666
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
TO FOURTH GREAT IS A WONDERFUL

667
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
SCHOOL ALTHOUGH THIS TRAGEDY

668
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
DEVASTATED SO MANY FOLKS.

669
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
>> Reporter: YEAH.

670
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
PEOPLE HAD SUCH HIGH PRAISE FOR

671
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HERE AND IT

672
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SLEEPY

673
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
NEW ENGLAND TOWN.
IT'S LINED WITH BEAUTIFUL HOMES

674
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
ON A VERY QUIET ROAD HERE.

675
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
THE SHOCK IS SUCH AN UNDER

676
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
STATEMENT TO SAY THAT THAT'S

677
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

678
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
THEY JUST HEAR IT OVER AND OVER

679
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AGAIN THAT PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT

680
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN.

681
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>> THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT AND IT

682
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
IS UNBELIEVABLE, BUT IT HAPPENED

683
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
AND IT'S REAL UNFORTUNATELY.

684
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
SO REAL.

685
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
MARY, STAND BY.

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT AND WHAT'S

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
RIGHT NOW.

696
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
>> WOLF, WE BELIEVE THE SHOOTER

697
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
MAY HAVE LIVED HERE.

698
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THIS MAY BE THE LOCATION WHERE

699
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
HE MAY HAVE SET OUT FROM THIS

700
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
MORNING TO HEAD UP TO NEWTOWN,

701
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
CONNECTICUT.
POLICE TELL US THEY HAVE IN

702
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
CUSTODY TWO PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

703
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
BEEN ROOMMATES OF HIS.

704
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED.

705
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WERE

706
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING.

707
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
FBI AND LOCAL POLICE AND A LOM

708
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SQUAD HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MOST OF

709
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THE AFTERNOON.

710
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
FBI AGENTS WENT BACK INTO THE

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
BUILDING.

712
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
IT'S A FIVE-STORY BUILDING AND

713
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
HAS TWO HALVES TO IT.

714
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
THREE BEDROOMS INSIDE.

715
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
IT'S A RENTAL AND I TALKED TO

716
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
SEVERAL RESIDENTS HERE WHO LIVE

717
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
IN THE BUILDING AND NEARBY.

718
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
NONE OF THEM KNOW THE SHOOTER,

719
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
ALLEGED SHOOTER OR HIS BROTHER

720
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
WHO MAY HAVE LIVED HERE.

721
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THEY HAVE SEEN PICTURES IN NEWS

722
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
REPORTS.
THE PICTURES DO NOT LOOK

723
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
FAMILIAR TO THEM.

724
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
YOU MAY KNOW THAT HOBOKEN IS A

725
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WATERFRONT COMMUNITY THAT LOOKS

726
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ACROSS FROM NEW YORK CITY.

727
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
IT'S A GROWING COMMUNITY FOR

728
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND HIT HARD

729
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
BY HURRICANE SANDY.

730
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WE WAIT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO

731
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000

733
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
STANDING GUARD.

734
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
FBI EDAGENTS ARE COMING BACK AN

735
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
FORTH.
>> THE WHOLE AREA IS CORDONED

736
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
OFF?
WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES

737
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000

738
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THE TAPE POSTED.

739
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
GIVE US A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT

740
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
YOU ARE SEEING.

741
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
>> AT LEAST TWO BLOCKS IN EAST

742
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000

743
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A HUGE MEDIA PRESENCE WAITING TO

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
SEE WHAT DEVELOPED HERE AND

745
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS IN FACT

746
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THE HOME OF THE ALLEGED SHOOTER,

747
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WHETHER OR NOT HIS BROTHER LIVED

748
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HERE WITH HIM.

749
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
WHAT THE CONNECTION IS TO

750
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
NEWTOWN.

751
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WHAT THE CONNECTION IS WITH HIS

752
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
MOTHER.
THERE IS A FACEBOOK PAGE THAT

753
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
INDICATES HIS HOME HERE, THAT HE

754
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
IS ORIGINALLY FROM NEWTOWN.

755
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I CANNOT CONFIRM THAT'S HIM AND

756
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
HIS PAGE.
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.

757
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THE AREA IS CORDONED OFF AND AT

758
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
LEAST TWO BLOCKS IN EACH

759
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
DIRECTION.

760
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>>> LOCAL POLICE THERE SAYING

761
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ANYTHING PROVIDING THE NEWS

762
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
MEDIA WITH ANY INFORMATION?

763
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
>> THERE WAS A VERY SHORT

764
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
BRIEFING FROM THE LOCAL POLICE

765
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
CHIEF.
AS I INDICATED BEFORE, TWO

766
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
PEOPLE ARE IN CUSTODY.

767
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THEY MAY BE THE SHOOTER'S

768
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
ROOMMATES, BUT THEY DON'T

769
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
BELIEVE THEY HAD INVOLVEMENT IN

770
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THE SHOOTING.
>> WHEN WE SAY IN CUSTODY, IT

771
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD A ROLE.

772
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
MAYBE MORE PRECISELY, THEY ARE

773
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
JUST BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT

774
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THEY KNOW OR MAY HAVE KNOWN

775
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
ABOUT THE ALLEGED SHOOTER.

776
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
>> RIGHT.

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THEY HAD

778
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
ANY ROLE.

779
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
IT JUST MAY BE THEY ARE LOOKING

780
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
TO FIND OUT MORE BACKGROUND

781
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLEGED
SHOOTER.

782
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

783
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
DISTINCTION THAT OR VIEWERS

784
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
APPRECIATE.

785
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO UPDATE

786
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THE VIEWERS WITH?

787
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
>> ANXIOUSLY ANTICIPATING WHAT

788
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
MAY COME OUT OF THIS AND WHAT'S

789
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
INSIDE THE APARTMENT AND MAY

790
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
LEAD US TO UNDERSTAND WHY

791
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SOMEONE MAY HAVE DONE THIS.

792
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WHAT KIND OF READING MATERIAL HE

793
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
HAD AND WHAT IS ON HIS COMPUTER.

794
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

795
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
>> THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT

796
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWER AND IF

797
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THERE IS A STATEMENT OR

798
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
INDICATION AS TO WHY THIS

799
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
INDIVIDUAL WENT TO THE SMALL

800
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, SANDY HOOK

801
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

802
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
CONNECTICUT AND OPENED FIRE

803
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
KILLING A TEACHER OR PRINCIPAL

804
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
AND 20 CHILDREN IN GREATS

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

806
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
GRADE.
WHAT A SHOCKING STORY.

807
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WE WILL STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH

808
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
YOU.
A YOUNG BOY AT THE SCHOOL WHERE

809
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED DESCRIBED

810
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
HOW HE AND OTHER CHILDREN

811
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ESCAPED.

812
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
>> I WAS IN THE GYM AT THE TIME.

813
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SO THE TEACHER AND WE HEARD A

814
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
LOST BANGS.

815
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE CUSTODIAN

816
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
KNOCKING STUFF DOWN AND WE HEARD

817
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
SCREAMING.

818
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WE WENT TO THE WALL AND SAT DOWN

819
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AND THEN A POLICE CAME IN AND

820
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
SAID IS HE IN HERE AND RAN OUT.

821
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
OUR TEACHER AND SOMEONE YELLED

822
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
GET TO A SAFE PLACE.

823
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
WE WENT TO THE CLOSET IN THE

824
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
GYM.
WE SAT THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE

825
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
AND THEN THE POLICE WERE

826
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND THEY

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
WERE LIKE WE ARE EVACUATING

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
PEOPLE.
WE RAN OUT AND THERE WERE POLICE

829
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
AT EVERY DOOR LEADING US DOWN

830
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
THIS WAY, DOWN THIS WAY, QUICK,

831
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
QUICK, COME ON.

832
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
WE RAN DOWN TO THE FIREHOUSE.

833
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THERE WAS A MAN PINNED DOWN TO

834
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THE GROUND WITH HANDCUFFS ON AND

835
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE VICTIM.

836
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
WE DIDN'T GET A GOOD GLANCE AT

837
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
HIM BECAUSE THERE WAS A CAR
BLOCKING IT.

838
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
PLUS WE WERE RUNNING REALLY

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
QUICK.

840
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THEN WE GOT TO THE FIREHOUSE AND

841
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
WE SAT IN OUR CLASSES AND WE

842
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
WERE ALL REALLY HAPPY WE WERE

843
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
ALL ALIVE.

844
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
>> BY THE WAY, WHEN WE INTRUDE

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THESE YOUNG KIDS, WE DO IT ONLY

846
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WITH THEIR PARENTS'S PERMISSION.

847
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
THEIR PARENTS ARE THERE ON THE

848
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
SCENE.
WE DON'T TALK TO THE CHILDREN

849
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
UNLESS THE PARENTS SAY THEY WANT

850
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THE CHILD TO SPEAK OUT AND THEY

851
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
ARE THERE TO WATCH THESE

852
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
INTERVIEWS.
WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO YOUNG

853
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
CHILDREN IN THESE KIND OF

854
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
TRAGEDIES.

855
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE

856
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
FEELING THE PAIN RIGHT NOW.

857
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
WE HEARD EARLIER FROM THE

858
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

859
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
LET'S BRING IN DR. DREW PINSKY,

860
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
THE HOST OF DR. DREW ON OUR

861
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
SISTER NETWORK, HLN.

862
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

863
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

864
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
THESE KIND OF TRAGIC INCIDENTS

865
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
OFTEN CAN BE PREVENTED IF LOVED

866
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
ONES, FAMILY MEMBERS AND

867
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS PAY

868
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
ATTENTION TO WARNING SIGNS.

869
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.

870
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
PAYING ATTENTION IS THE BIG

871
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
LESSON FROM SO MUCH WE HAVE BEEN

872
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
HEARING IN THE NEWS.

873
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
DENIAL BY FAMILY MEMBERS AND

874
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
PARENTS IS THE ENEMY.

875
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MANY

876
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
SITUATIONS I HAVE BEEN IN WHERE

877
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I GIVE FAMILY MEMBERS VERY

878
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS TO PREVENT

879
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
DISASTERS AND THEY CHOOSE TO

880
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
STAY IN DENIAL AND COME TO TERMS

881
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR LOVED

882
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
ONE IS NOT DOING WELL AND MAY

883
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
NOT BE TRUST WORTHY AND MAY BE

884
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
AGGRESSIVE OR VIOLENT.

885
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
AS I SIT AND LISTEN TO THE

886
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
STORY, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS

887
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WONDERFUL COVERAGE YOU HAVE BEEN

888
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
PROVIDING THAT HELPS US

889
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AS THE

890
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
DAYS GO ON.
WE WILL TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT

891
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
HAPPENED.

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
THE FEELINGS THAT RUSH OVER ME

893
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
AND RUN FROM SADNESS TO DISGUST

894
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
AND RAGE MYSELF.

895
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
DISGUST IS MOSTLY WHERE I FIND

896
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
MYSELF TODAY.

897
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
DISGUST THAT THESE LIVES SHOULD

898
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED SO YOUNG,

899
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE LIVES TO

900
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
HAVE BEEN LOST IN VAIN.

901
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
YOU DID A REMARKABLE INTERVIEW

902
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WITH A FATHER OF A YOUNG CHILD

903
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS.

904
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HE SAID THEY HAD JUST DISCUSSED

905
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THE ISSUE AND I'M SURE HE WAS

906
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
TALKING ABOUT THE OREGON SHOOTER

907
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
AND REASSURING THIS IS CHILDREN

908
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THEIR
COMMUNITY AND NOW HE IS

909
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
ADDRESSING THEM WITH THE

910
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
QUESTION THEY ARE ASKING HIM,

911
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN

912
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
AGAIN?
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT EVERY

913
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ONE OF OUR CHILDREN WILL ASK US

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
TONIGHT.
THEY WILL FEEL VULNERABLE AND

915
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WHEN IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN TO US

916
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
AND HAPPEN AGAIN?

917
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
THESE STORIES ARE FLOODING THE

918
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
NEWS AND WE MUST, EACH OF US AS

919
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
A HOUSEHOLD LEAD OUR WAY OUT OF

920
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THIS.

921
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
THIS REQUIRES LEADERSHIP.

922
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
OUR POLITICAL LEADERS ARE SORT

923
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
OF NOT GIVING US QUITE WHAT I

924
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THINK WE NEED TODAY.

925
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WE WILL BE OKAY.

926
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THIS IS A RESILIENT COUNTRY AND

927
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

928
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
WE ARE IN A NEW ZONE WHEN EVIL

929
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
PREVAILED.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS.

930
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
IT'S OKAY TO BE FIRM AND

931
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
EMPATHETIC WITH PEOPLE IF

932
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SOMEONE IS MISBEHAVING.

933
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
BE FIRM AND TAKE ACTION.

934
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

935
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

936
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO TELL OUR

937
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
KIDS.

938
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
>> WHAT MOTIVATES SOMEONE TO GO

939
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OUT AND SHOOT AND KILL CHILDREN?

940
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
>> YOU ARE ASKING A QUESTION

941
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THAT IT FILLS ME WITH DISGUST TO

942
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
HAVE TO ANSWER.

943
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
IT'S ONE THING TO EXPLAIN WHAT

944
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
HAPPENED IN OREGON.

945
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
PERHAPS THIS YOUNG MAN HAD A

946
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
BREAK OR WAS EXPOSED TO A

947
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
CHEMICAL OR SOMETHING THAT

948
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
CAUSED HIM TO THINK IN A

949
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
DISTORTED WAY.

950
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
THIS IS NOT JUST THAT.

951
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO FELT

952
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
ENTITLE AND JUSTIFIED TO ACT

953
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
OUT.

954
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THIS IS GRANDIOSITY AND FEELING

955
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
SPECIAL.
THIS IS FEELING LIKE HE IS MORE

956
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF THESE

957
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OTHER LIVES OR EXPOSED US TO

958
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THIS VIOLENCE AND IS GOING TO

959
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
SHOW WHY HE IS SO IMPORTANT AND

960
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
FEEL VERY JUSTIFIED IN WHAT HE

961
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
IS DOING.

962
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THIS IS A LONGER TERM KIND OF

963
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
DISTORTED THINKING THAN WHAT WE

964
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
SAW IN OREGON.

965
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
>> THEN THIS PERSON SUPPOSEDLY

966
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
WINDS UP KILLING HIMSELF.

967
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IT SEEMS SO TOTALLY CRAZY.

968
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
>> RIGHT.
WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST KILL

969
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
HIMSELF?
WHY DOES HE HAVE TO TAKE THE

970
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
LIVES WITH HIM?

971
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
THAT IS THE GRANDIOSITY AND THE

972
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
DISTORTION AND THE ENTITLEMENT

973
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND AGGRESSION.

974
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT EVIL, I

975
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SUSPECT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

976
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
TALKING ABOUT HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND

977
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THE DETAILS ABOUT THIS MAN'S

978
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
MENTAL HEALTH, BUT I SUSPECT

979
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
IT'S GOING TO BE CHRONIC SEVERE

980
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
TROUBLED BEHAVIOR THAT FOR

981
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
WHATEVER REASON WAS NOT PROPERLY

982
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
MANAGED.
>> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, CHEMICAL

983
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IMBALANCES IN THE BRAIN,

984
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SOMETIMES YOU HEAR PSYCHIATRISTS

985
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
AND PSYCHOLOGISTS TALKING ABOUT

986
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
SOMETHING THAT SNAPS AND CAUSES

987
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
PEOPLE TO DO THIS.

988
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
GIVE US YOUR SENSE.

989
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING

990
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ABOUT JUST DAYS AGO IN RELATION

991
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
TO OREGON.

992
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THAT WAS MORE THAT KIND OF A

993
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
CIRCUMSTANCE.

994
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
THIS NO DOUBT THERE WAS STRESS.

995
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
ALL HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS BECAUSE OF

996
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THIS INSTRUMENT UP HERE.

997
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY DID CROSS A

998
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THRESHOLD FOR HIM THAT CAUSED

999
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HIM TO ACT OUT VIOLENTLY.

1000
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING OF A

1001
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
MORE CHRONIC, SEVERE, STRUCTURAL

1002
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WIRING NATURE IN THE BRAIN AND

1003
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
REGIONS NOT FIRING OR NEVER

1004
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
FIRING THAT WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE

1005
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
TO BE EM PATHIC OR FEEL LIKE A

1006
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
PART OF HUMANITY.

1007
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THERE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT

1008
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ALLOW US TO FEEL THAT WAY.

1009
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THOSE PARTS OF THE BRAIN IN

1010
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
TERMS OF MISFIRING THE BRAIN, I

1011
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
SUSPECT THOSE ARE THE AREAS WE

1012
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
WILL SEE CHRONICALLY WERE NOT

1013
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
OPERATING NORMALLY.

1014
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
>> NOT NORMALLY AT ALL.

1015
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

1016
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
PERSPECTIVE.

1017
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
OUR PRODUCER HAS BEEN IN A

1018
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
FIRESTORM HERE WHERE THE PANIC

1019
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
RUSHED TO FIND THEIR CHILDREN

1020
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
AND MANY OF THE PARENTS ARE

1021
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
INSIDE RIGHT NOW INCLUDING

1022
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
PARENTS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR

1023
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
KIDS.
DESCRIBE THE INFORMATION YOU

1024
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HAVE SEEN AND HEARD.

1025
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
>> WE HAD IMAGINE VEHICLES IN

1026
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
AND AROUND THIS FIREHOUSE AND

1027
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE

1028
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SCHOOL.

1029
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THIS IS THE STOPPING POINT WHERE

1030
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
EMERGENCY VEHICLES STOP AT AND

1031
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
HEAD TOWARDS THE SCHOOL.

1032
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
WE HAVE SEEN ATF AND FBI.

1033
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
MANY OF THEM CARRY ASSAULT

1034
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WEAPONS AND WEARING GEAR AND

1035
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
LIKE YOU MENTIONED, THERE

1036
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
FAMILIES STILL INSIDE THIS

1037
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
FIREHOUSE.
I THINK IT'S A SHORT WHILE AGO

1038
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
REALLY QUITE A MOVING SCENE.

1039
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THERE WERE THREE SETS IS OF

1040
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
PRARNTS THAE CAN ONLY ASSUME

1041
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
ARE PARENT COUPLES WALKING

1042
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OUT OF THE FIREHOUSE AND THEIR

1043
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND LIPS

1044
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
TREMBLING AND THE FIREMEN ES

1045
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
CORING THEM OUT SEEMED AS

1046
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
VISIBLY SHAKEN AS THEM.

1047
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THEY ARE NOT TALKING TO ANYONE,

1048
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
BUT IT'S A SMALL SLICE OF WHAT'S

1049
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
HAPPENING AND IT HAPPENED

1050
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE.

1051
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SINCE I HAVE BEEN STANDING HERE,

1052
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
YOU SEE THOSE PARENTS AND YOU

1053
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
SEE THE INDIVIDUALS AND NURSES

1054
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
AND YOU SEE SCHOOL CAFETERIA

1055
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
WORKERS.

1056
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
YOU SEE NUNS EVEN WALKING IN AND

1057
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
AROUND AND SPEAKING WITH THOSE

1058
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
EMERGENCY WORKERS AND SPEAKING

1059
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
WITH PARENTS.

1060
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THERE FEW WORDS THAT YOU CAN PUT

1061
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
TO SOMEONE.

1062
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
ASK THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE

1063
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
FEELING.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I

1064
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
MIGHT SAY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

1065
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW INSTANCES

1066
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THAT LEAVES YOU WITHOUT WORDS TO

1067
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
CAPTURE THE TREE MAGNITUDE OF

1068
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

1069
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I WALKED INTO TOWN EARLIER AND

1070
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SAT IN A RESTAURANT AND PEOPLE

1071
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
ARE WATCHING THE NEWS.

1072
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
THEY WILL PICK THEIR HEAD BACK

1073
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
UP AND WATCH AGAIN.

1074
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
OTHERS ARE AT THE MEDIA STAGING

1075
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
AREA TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT IS

1076
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
TRANSPIRING AND THE SENSE OF

1077
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
WANTING TO BE WITH THE

1078
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
COMMUNITY.

1079
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
LIKE YOU MENTIONED, THIS IS A

1080
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
SMALL SLEEPY TOWN IN NEW

1081
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
ENGLAND.
THERE IS A CEMETERY THAT SITS

1082
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OVER THE OVERPASS THAT LOOKS ON

1083
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
TO THAT FIREHOUSE AND DOWN THE

1084
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
ROAD IS THE SCHOOL.

1085
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

1086
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
TRANSPIRED IN THAT SCHOOL, IT'S

1087
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
LIKE DR. DREW SAID, IT LEAVES

1088
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WITH YOU A SENSE OF DISGUST.

1089
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
>> TOTAL DISGUST.

1090
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
IT'S GOING TO BE DARK THERE

1091
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
PRETTY SOON, BUT THE FIREHOUSE

1092
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
WHERE YOU ARE, THE PARENTS AND

1093
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
LOVED ONES ARE BEING CONSOLED BY

1094
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
GRIEF COUNSELLORS AND OTHERS.

1095
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
CLERGY INSIDE AS WELL.

1096
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WE SPOKE TO A RABBI WHO IS

1097
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
INSIDE CONSOLING THE FAMILY

1098
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
MEMBERS.

1099
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CONSOLE

1100
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
SOMEONE WHO JUST LOST A CHILD.

1101
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
SOMEONE AT THAT AGE, I CAN'T

1102
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

1103
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THE WORD INCONSOLABLE APPLIES

1104
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
HERE.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

1105
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE DEALING

1106
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WITH AND REALING FOR FOR A LONG

1107
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
TIME NOW.

1108
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
YOU TALK TO RESIDENTS AND GET

1109
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
THE SENSE THAT A LOT OF THESE

1110
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER.

1111
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVED TO THE

1112
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
AREA FROM WHAT THEY TOLD BECAUSE

1113
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

1114
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I TALKED TO A TREECHER WHO SAID

1115
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THAT.
TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TAKE

1116
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
PLACE IN ONE OF THE SCHOOLS AND

1117
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AT

1118
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THAT, IT JUST LEAVES YOU WITHOUT

1119
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
WORDS.

1120
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
>> DAVID, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

1121
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
THAT UPDATE.

1122
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS ON THE

1123
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
SCENE.

1124
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WE HAVE MARY SNOW THERE AND

1125
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

1126
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
WE HAVE OTHER REPORTERS AND

1127
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
PRODUCERS WATCHING WHAT'S GOING

1128
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
ON IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1129
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
ALSO WE SAW ADAM REECE ON THE

1130
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
SCENE IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, A

1131
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN A RESIDENTIAL

1132
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
AREA AND WHAT UNFOLDED AT THE

1133
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SMALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

1134
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1135
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN IT A LOCAL

1136
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
NURSE WHO RAN TO THE SCENE SOON

1137
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING AND DESCRIBED

1138
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WHAT SHE SAW.

1139
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> I SEE YOU HAVE BEEN CRYING.

1140
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> YES.

1141
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> IS IT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU

1142
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SAW?

1143
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
>> NO, THEY WOULDN'T LET US IN

1144
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THE BUILDING.
ALL I CAN SAY IS ONE OF THE COPS

1145
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SAID IT WAS THE WORST THING HE

1146
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HAD SEEN IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER.

1147
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
IT WAS WHEN THEY TOLD ALL THESE

1148
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PARENT WHO IS WERE WAITING FOR

1149
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THEIR PARENTS TO COME OUT, THEY

1150
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.

1151
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THERE IS 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

1152
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
JUST TOLD THEIR CHILDREN ARE

1153
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
DEAD.
IT WAS AWFUL.

1154
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
>> AWFUL INDEED.

1155
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
ASHLEIGH BANFIELD IS NOW ON THE

1156
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
SCENE FOR US IN NEWTOWN,

1157
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
CONNECTICUT AS WELL.

1158
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I KNOW YOU GOT THERE A LITTLE

1159
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WHILE AGO, BUT GIVE OUR VIEWERS

1160
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
A SENSE OF WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

1161
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
AND HEARING.

1162
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> I'M IN THE SAME PLACE THAT

1163
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THE CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR DAN

1164
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
MALLOY UPDATED US ALL.

1165
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COLLECTION

1166
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
OF MICROPHONES THIS IS A

1167
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
CONCENTRATED MEDIA CENTER.

1168
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THERE DOZENS OF REPORTERS HERE

1169
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
AND ARRIVING EVERY MOMENT.

1170
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I HATE TO BRING THIS UP, BUT IT

1171
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
GIVES ME THE SENSE OF COLUMBINE

1172
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
AND HOW MASSIVE THE SCOPE OF

1173
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THIS STORY HAS BECOME.

1174
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
ONE OF THE UPDATES WE GOT,

1175
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
DEVASTATING DETAIL ON THIS.

1176
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THAT IS THE INVESTIGATION THAT

1177
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IS ABOUT TO ENSUE.

1178
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WOLF, THE BODIES OF THOSE

1179
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
CHILDREN ARE STILL IN THE

1180
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
SCHOOL.
18 CHILDREN DIED IN THE SCHOOL

1181
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
AND WERE DEAD ON THE SCENE.

1182
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
TWO MORE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

1183
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
AND DIED THERE.

1184
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THE SIX ADULTS ALSO WHO DIED AT

1185
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THE SCHOOL, THEIR BODIES ARE

1186
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
STILL THERE.
THE POLICE WHO UPDATED US TOLD

1187
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
US THAT THE SCOPE OF THE

1188
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
INVESTIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF

1189
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WORK THEY HAVE TO DO TO PIECE

1190
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THIS ALL TOGETHER IS GOING TO

1191
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
TAKE A VERY LONG TIME.

1192
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THE PARENTS

1193
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
ARE DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT

1194
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THE

1195
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
INFORMATION OR AT LEAST KNOW

1196
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THAT THEIR CHILD IS BEING

1197
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
BROUGHT OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

1198
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IT IS JUST OVERWHELMING IN THIS

1199
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
TINY COMMUNITY OF 27,000 PEOPLE.

1200
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
IN THE STICKS.
WHEN YOU DRIVE HERE, YOU ARE

1201
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
WINDING ROADS AND HILLS AND THE

1202
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
HOMES ARE FAR APART AND YET THE

1203
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
COMMUNITY IS QUITE CLOSE

1204
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
TOGETHER.
A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT

1205
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
SHED LIGHT ON THE DETAIL ON HOW

1206
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE, THE

1207
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
POLICE TOLD US THAT THE

1208
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
SHOOTINGS WERE CONCENTRATED AND

1209
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THEY WERE IN AN AREA OF THE

1210
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
SCHOOL, PARTICULARLY TWO ROOMS.

1211
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THERE WASN'T RUNNING THROUGH THE

1212
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
HALLS AS THEY DESCRIBED IT.

1213
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
NO SHOOTER RUNNING THROUGH THE

1214
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
HALLS AND SHOOTING.

1215
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
IT MIGHT GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION

1216
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
AS TO WHY WE THINK THERE WAS A

1217
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
CONCENTRATION OF ONE ENTIRE

1218
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
DLASZ IS UNACCOUNTED FOR THAT

1219
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN THOSE

1220
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
TWO ROOMS.

1221
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER CRIME SCENE

1222
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
NOW IN THIS TINY TOWN OF

1223
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1224
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING ANOTHER

1225
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IN A HOME.

1226
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE WERE

1227
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
MANY COUCH TERMS BEING USED.

1228
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
PEOPLE ARE BEING VERY CAREFUL IN

1229
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
HOW THEY REPORT THIS, BUT THEY

1230
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
SAID THE SHOOTER IN THE SCHOOL

1231
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
LIVED WITH ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

1232
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

1233
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND SHOT

1234
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
DEAD IN THE SCHOOL.

1235
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
WHETHER THAT IS THE HOME WHERE

1236
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING AS WELL

1237
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
IS UNCLEAR.

1238
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
HIS FATHER LIVING IN THE TOWN AS

1239
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WELL AND A BROTHER TOO.

1240
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
THERE IS A LOT OF DETAIL WE NEED

1241
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
TO PIECE TOGETHER.

1242
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
ANOTHER DETAIL THAT CAME FROM

1243
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THE MOUTH OF A CHILD WITH THE

1244
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
SWEETEST VOICE WHO IS BEING

1245
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
INTRUDE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.

1246
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THIS CHILD TOLD A STORY OF HOW

1247
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
THE TEACHERS TRIED TO PROTECT

1248
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
THEM FROM THE INFORMATION AS

1249
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THEY WERE GETTING THEM OUT OF

1250
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THE SCHOOL, SAYING THERE WAS AN

1251
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
ANIMAL IN THE SCHOOL AND THAT'S

1252
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
WHY THEY NEEDED TO LOCK THE

1253
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
DOORS TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE

1254
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
NOISE THEY COULD HEAR WHICH WAS

1255
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
A WILD ANIMAL THAT GOT INTO THE

1256
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
SCHOOL.

1257
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
TO HEAR THAT TINY VOICE TELLING

1258
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THAT, IT WAS PRETTY REMARKABLE.

1259
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
>> I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT

1260
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
STORY FOR ALL OF US TO COVER.

1261
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I KNOW YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

1262
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
>> I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN

1263
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
A CONNECTICUT SCHOOL ABOUT 30

1264
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
MINUTES AWAY FROM HERE AS WELL.

1265
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
WHEN THE NEWS BROKE IT WAS TOUGH

1266
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
TO SORT OUT WHERE IT HAPPENED.

1267
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
WHICH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IT WAS.

1268
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
AS THE DETAILS ROLL IN,

1269
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN IMMENSELY

1270
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
AFFECTED AND APOLOGIZE, BUT IT

1271
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
IS REMARKABLE TO SEE THIS MANY

1272
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SEASONED REPORTERS WHO I HAVE

1273
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
BEEN IN THE FIELD WITH FOR 20

1274
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
YEARS ALL HAVING THE SAME

1275
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
REACTION TO WHAT'S TRANSPIRED.

1276
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
>> YOU CHOKED UP AND THE

1277
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IS CHOKING UP AND WIPING AWAY

1278
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
TEARS AS WELL.

1279
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
YOUR GIRLS, HOW ARE THEY?

1280
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
YOUR KIDS.

1281
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
>> MY KIDS ARE FINE.

1282
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS EVEN

1283
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THOUGH THEY ARE ABOUT I HALF

1284
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
HOUR AWAY FROM HERE, WHEN I

1285
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CALLED THE SCHOOL TO FIND OUT IS

1286
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
EVERYTHING OKAY AND ARE WE UNDER

1287
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
LOCKDOWN AND WHAT'S THE PROTOCOL

1288
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AND ARE YOU SENDING THE KIDS

1289
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
HOME?

1290
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
IT AFFECTED THEM DEEPLY.

1291
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
DID PERIMETER CHECKS AND

1292
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
MADE SURE THAT ALL THE LOCKED

1293
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
DOORS WERE LOCKED.

1294
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THEY DID SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW

1295
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
ABOUT.
THEY WENT INTO AN INFORMATION

1296
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
PROTECTIVE MODE AND SAID NO ONE

1297
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IS ALLOWED TO DISCUSSIONS THE

1298
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
DETAILS WITHIN THE SCHOOL LS.

1299
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
IN THE ONLY 30 MINUTES AWAY, BUT

1300
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THEY WOULD HAVE STAFF AND

1301
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
SECURITY OUTSIDE THAT SCHOOL
STO HANDLE THE PTIAL FOR

1302
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
CHILDREN TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

1303
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
THEY CLEARLY WANT THE KIDS TO

1304
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
HEAR ABOUT IT FROM THEIR

1305
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
PARENTS.
THEY ARE ALL GOING TO HEAR ABOUT

1306
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
IT AND ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE

1307
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
SURE THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO THE

1308
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
SURROUNDING CHILDREN AS THEY CAN

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
BE.

1310
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
IT IS A REALLY OVERWHELMING

1311
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
FEELING TO LIVE HERE AND TO BE

1312
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
HERE AS A REPORTER.

1313
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
>> IT'S A POWERFUL,OWERL

1314
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
IMAGE THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING

1315
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
AND JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

1316
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, KIDS DON'T

1317
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL, BUT MONDAY

1318
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
MORNING, KIDS IN YOUR

1319
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEWTOWN,

1320
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CONNECTICUT AND ALL OVER THE

1321
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
UNITED STATES, THEY ARE GOING TO

1322
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL THE WEEK

1323
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND WHAT AN

1324
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
AWFUL TIME TO HAVE TO ENDURE

1325
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THIS PAIN.
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, WOLF.

1326
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
THE SCHOOL IS BEYOND THOSE

1327
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
TREES.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LIGHT

1328
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ENOUGH TO SEE.
WE ARE LOCATED IN THE STAGING

1329
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AREA WHERE THE POLICE WANTED TO

1330
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
MAKE SURE THE HUNDREDS OF MEDIA

1331
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
THEY WOULD SEND HERE WOULD BE

1332
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
ABLE TO BE SAFELY PARK AND OUT

1333
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
OF THE WAY OF THE RESIDENTS.

1334
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
BEYOND THIS PLAYING FIELD AND

1335
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
OVER THOSE TREES IS WHERE THE

1336
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
SCHOOL IS LOCATED.

1337
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
BECAUSE ONE OF THE DESCRIPTIONS

1338
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
THAT CAME IN FROM SOMEONE WHO

1339
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
WAS IN A MEETING WITH SEVEN

1340
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
GROWN UP WHEN IS THIS HAPPENED,

1341
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
THERE WERE ROUGHLY 100 ROUNDS

1342
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THAT THIS PARENT COULD HEAR.

1343
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
A WOMAN TELLING HER STORY.

1344
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THE INVESTIGATION ALONE, ONCE

1345
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
THE TINY BODIES ARE REMOVED AND

1346
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THE ADULTS ARE REMOVED.

1347
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
THE INVESTIGATION OF THE

1348
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
TRAJECTORY AND WHERE THE BULLETS

1349
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
LANDED OR ANGLE THE BULLETS CAME

1350
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
FROM, THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT

1351
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
WILL NEED TO BE KNOWN.

1352
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I DOUBT ANYONE WILL BE COMING TO

1353
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
THIS SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME.

1354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
>> POLICE ARE GOING TO BE

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
GETTING THEIR INVESTIGATION.

1356
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
PLEASE STAND BY.

1357
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AND I

1358
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
KNOW YOU ARE COLLECTING MORE

1359
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
INFORMATION HERE IN WASHINGTON.

1360
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THERE IS A VIGIL OUTSIDE THE

1361
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WHITE HOUSE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

1362
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
ARE GATHERING RIGHT NOW.

1363
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
THE PRESIDENT ORDERED ALL FLAGS

1364
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF UNTIL

1365
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
DECEMBER 18th.
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURES COMING

1366
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
IN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

1367
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT GUN

1368
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
CONTROL AND THEY ARE HOLDING A

1369
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
VIGIL OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE

1370
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
RIGHT NOW INSIDE THE WHITE

1371
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
HOUSE.

1372
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, PRESIDENT

1373
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
OBAMA WENT INTO THE BRIEFING

1374
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
ROOM TO ADDRESS THE AMERICAN

1375
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
PEOPLE AND BECAME VERY

1376
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
EMOTIONAL.

1377
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

1378
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

1379
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
MULLEN.
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

1380
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

1381
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

1382
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT

1383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

1384
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

1385
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
VICTIMS, COUPLE THEIR FAMILIES.

1386
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1387
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

1388
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
YEARS AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

1390
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
PRESIDENT, BZ ANYBODY ELSE

1391
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT.

1392
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

1393
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

1394
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1395
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

1396
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
DO.

1397
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1398
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

1399
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
BEAUTIFUL KIDS BETWEEN THE AGES

1400
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

1401
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1402
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1403
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1404
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

1405
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1406
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
TEACHERS AND MEN AND WOMEN WHO

1407
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

1408
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

1409
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
DREAMS.
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

1410
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

1411
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

1412
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1413
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

1414
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

1415
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1416
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

1417
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
WELL.
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

1418
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1419
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THEIR

1420
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1421
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

1422
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
AND THERE NO WORDS THAT WILL

1423
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

1424
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN

1425
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

1426
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

1427
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

1428
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
MALL IN OREGON OR TEMPLE IN

1429
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
WISCONSIN OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

1430
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

1431
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
CHICAGO.
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

1432
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE CHILDREN

1433
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ARE OUR CHILDREN.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMING

1434
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
TO AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

1435
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

1436
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

1437
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

1438
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN

1439
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG OUR

1440
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER AND

1441
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM AND WE

1442
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
WILL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

1443
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1444
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
THERE FAMILIES WHO CANNOT DO

1445
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
THAT TONIGHT.

1446
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT NOW.

1447
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
OUR DAYS TO COME, THAT COMMUNITY

1448
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR BEST AS

1449
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
AMERICANS AND I WILL DO

1450
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

1451
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

1452
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

1453
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

1454
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
LOVED ONE,ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

1455
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
A HAND TO THOSE IN NEED TO

1456
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
REMINDHEM THAT WE'RE THERE FOR

1457
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
THEM AND WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM

1458
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
AND THAT THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR

1459
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST

1460
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT IN OURS.

1461
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

1462
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

1463
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE

1464
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
BROKENHEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

1465
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
WOUNDS.

1466
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1467
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
STATES OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY

1468
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
EMOTIONAL LIKE SO MANY MILLIONS

1469
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER

1470
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.

1471
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND

1472
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
RESUME THE SPECIAL COVERAGE

1473
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000

00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
AND NOT ONLY WITH THE FAMILIES

1655
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT WITH

1656
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
ALL THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE

1657
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
POLICE AND FIRE AND EMS.

1658
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
ALL WORKING AT WHAT I DESCRIBED

1659
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
AS A HORRIFIC AND DIFFICULT

1660
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
SCENE.
CERTAINLY A LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH

1661
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM HAD

1662
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
BEEN ON SCENE AND HAVE BEEN HERE

1663
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
ALL OF TODAY WORKING AND

1664
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
ASSISTING AND HELPING.

1665
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

1666
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
THERE WERE 18 CHILDREN

1667
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE AND

1668
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
TWO CHILDREN TRANSPORTED TO AREA

1669
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
HOSPITALS AND PRONOUNCED DEAD AT

1670
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
THE HOSPITAL.

1671
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
SIX ADULTS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT

1672
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
THE SCENE AND OBVIOUSLY THE

1673
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
SHOOTER WAS ALSO PRONOUNCED DEAD

1674
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
AT THE SCENE.

1675
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I DON'T HAVE MUCH DETAIL ABOUT

1676
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
THE SECONDARY SCENE, BUT THERE

1677
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
IS A RELATED SCENE WE DISCOVERED

1678
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
AS WE WERE CONTINUING THE

1679
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND

1680
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATING THE

1681
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
SHOOTER.

1682
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
YOU PROBABLY SAW AND SOMEONE

1683
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
ASKED ME ABOUT THE BOMB SKAD AND

1684
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
YES, WE BROUGHT ALL OUR ASSETS

1685
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
IN IN CASE THEY WERE NEEDED AND

1686
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
WE WENT OUT TO SEARCH OR EXECUTE

1687
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
SEARCH WARRANTS OR EXAMINE OTHER

1688
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
SCENES, WE TOOK THEM WITH US TO

1689
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
ENSURE THEY WERE RIGHT THERE TO

1690
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
REACT IF IT WAS NECESSARY.

1691
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE AS FAR

1692
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
AS THE DETAILS ARE CONCERNED.

1693
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE

1694
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
BRIEFING AND TRY IT GET BACK UP

1695
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
HERE FOR MORE BRIEFING.

1696
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF

1697
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
QUESTIONS, BUT I MUST TELL YOU

1698
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
THERE CERTAIN THINGS WE CANNOT

1699
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
DISCUSS.
>> DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE

1700
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
HOSPITAL NOW THAT SURVIVED THIS?

1701
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
>> NO, SIR.
ONE PERSON WAS INJURED THAT

1702
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
SUFFERED AN INJURY AND DID

1703
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
SURVIVE, YES.
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM THE BODY OF

1704
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
THE MALE?

1705
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM.

1706
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I KNOW ABOUT THE SECONDARY SCENE

1707
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET

1708
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
INTO DETAIL.

1709
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I WILL DO THAT FOR 6:00.

1710
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
>> WHAT'S THE SHOOTER'S

1711
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
IDENTITY?

1712
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
>> I WILL NOT CONFIRM THAT.

1713
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
WE HAVE A TENTATIVE

1714
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
IDENTIFICATION AND WORKING WITH

1715
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
THAT.
WE WILL NOT CONFIRM THE IDENTITY

1716
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
AND PUT THAT OUT THERE.

1717
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
WE WILL AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME.

1718
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT

1719
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
RIGHT NOW.

1720
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
>> WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

1721
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
INVESTIGATION IN HOBOKEN?

1722
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
>> IT'S PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT

1723
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
WE DO.

1724
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
WE WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED

1725
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
AS WE ELECTRIC AT EVERY FACET OF

1726
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
THE INVESTIGATION WHETHER IT'S
THE SHOOTER OR THE VICTIMS.

1727
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
WE WILL LOOK AT EVERYTHING.

1728
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
WE CERTAINLY WILL GO IN AND OUT

1729
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
OF STATE AND WORK WITH FELLOW

1730
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING

1731
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
FEDERAL AGENCY FIST WE NEED TO

1732
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION TO

1733
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
EXACTLY WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE AND

1734
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
IT WILL BE A CROSS THAT WILL GET

1735
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
IT DONE.

1736
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
>> RIGHT NOW, ONE SHOOTER.
YES, SIR.

1737
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
>> IT WAS K-4.

1738
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

1739
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
GRID.
THAT'S THE SCHOOL.

1740
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
THEY WERE ALL STUDENTS OF THAT

1741
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
SCHOOL.

1742
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I DON'T KNOW THE GRADE THEY WERE
IN.

1743
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

1744
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
IT WAS ONE SECTION AND TWO

1745
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
CLASSROOMS.

1746
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

1747
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I DIDN'T FIND THAT OUT.

1748
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
YOUR QUESTION?

1749
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

1750
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK US A LONG

1751
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
TIME TO GET HERE.

1752
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
ANY STUDENTS UNACCOUNTED FOR, WE

1753
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
HAD TO ENSURE THAT WE ACCOUNTED

1754
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
FOR EVERY STUDENT AND THAT

1755
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
INCLUDES MAYBE SOMEONE THAT WAS

1756
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
ABSENT FOR THE DAY BECAUSE OF

1757
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
ILLNESS AND DIDN'T COME TO

1758
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
SCHOOL.

1759
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
THAT WAS PART OF THE PROCESS WE
HAD TO GO THROUGH AND NOW WE

1760
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
HAVE THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS

1761
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
WHICH IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

1762
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
IT'S SOMETIME BEFORE WE ARE ABLE

1763
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION.

1764
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
IT PROBABLY WON'T BE AVAILABLE

1765
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
UNTIL SOMETIME TOMORROW.

1766
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
DID WE IDENTIFY THE WEAPONS?

1767
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
YES, WE HAVE.
>> HOW MANY?

1768
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
>> WE WILL NOT DISCUSS THAT AT

1769
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
THIS TIME.

1770
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
>> YOU REACHING THE PARENTS?

1771
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
>> WE WOULD NOT COME UP HERE

1772
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
UNTIL WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT

1773
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
WITH THE PARENTS AND

1774
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
COMMUNICATING WITH THEM SINCE
THEY ARRIVED HERE AT THE SCENE.

1775
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY INFORM AND

1776
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO

1777
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
COME UP HERE.

1778
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
>> HOW WERE THE FIRST RESPONDERS

1779
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
DEALING WITH THIS.

1780
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
NO ONE CAN EXPECT TO WALK INTO A

1781
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
SCHOOL AND SEE THOSE MASS

1782
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
CASUALTIE

1783
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
CASUALTIES.
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

1784
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
EVERYONE BELIEVES THAT IT'S

1785
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
SOMETHING THAT FIRST RESPONDERS

1786
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
DO AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES, BUT

1787
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
WE PROVIDED COUNSELING FOR THE

1788
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE THIS

1789
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
WAS A VERY TRAGIC HORRIFIC SCENE

1790
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
THEY ENCOUNTERED.

1791
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO

1792
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
SEE.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE SEE EVERY

1793
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
DAY.

1794
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
THAT'S ONE THING WE HAD DONE AND

1795
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
THE COLONEL MADE THAT PERFECTLY

1796
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
CLEAR THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE TO

1797
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
BE SPOKEN TO AND RECEIVE CRISIS

1798
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
COUNSELING AS REQUIRED.

1799
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
>> YOU HAVE TO BE THE FACE OF

1800
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND --

1801
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
[INAUDIBLE].

1802
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
>> THE LIEUTENANT CAN TELL YOU.

1803
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
>> A PERSON -- [INAUDIBLE].

1804
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
>> CAN YOU SAY YOUR NAME,

1805
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
PLEASE?

1806
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
>> LIEUTENANT GEORGE CINCO.

1807
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
SINKO.

1808
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
>> YOU CAN TELL US ALSO THE ONES

1809
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
YOU HAVE.

1810
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
>> THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY THE

1811
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
WORST THING WE HAD EXPERIENCED

1812
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
HERE IN TOWN.

1813
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
TRAGIC.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

1814
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS.

1815
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
OUR OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONAL

1816
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
AND WE WILL DEAL WITH THIS AS

1817
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
WELL.

1818
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
>> YOU CAN DESCRIBE THE SCENE

1819
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
WITH THE PARENTS AND THE PLACE

1820
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING

1821
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
TOGETHER?
>> THE LOCAL HOSPITAL OFFERED

1822
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
CRISIS INTERVENTION AND WILL BE

1823
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
AVAILABLE AT REED INTERMEDIATE

1824
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
SCHOOL AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE

1825
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
RIGHT NOW IF NEED BE AND WILL BE

1826
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
THERE ALL WEEKEND.

1827
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
>> IS THERE A PLACE WHERE

1828
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
PARENTS ARE GATHERING AND CAN

1829
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
YOU DESCRIBE THAT?

1830
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
>> THE PARENTS HAVE GATHERED AT

1831
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
THE LOCAL FIREHOUSE WHICH IS

1832
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
ADJACENT TO THE SCHOOL AND WE

1833
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO COMFORT

1834
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
THEM AND TRY TO REASSURE THEM

1835
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
THAT WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE

1836
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
CAN.
AS MENTIONED, IT'S A DIFFICULT

1837
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
PROCESS TO CONFIRM THE STATUS OF

1838
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
AN ENTIRE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1839
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
WE NEED TO BE RIGHT WHEN WE DO

1840
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
THAT.

1841
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
.
>> WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE

1842
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
FAMILIES RIGHT NOW AND DO

1843
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR THEM.

1844
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
>> WAS ONE OF THE TEACHERS --

1845
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
[INAUDIBLE].
>> WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT RIGHT

1846
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
NOW.
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1847
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
>>> THE PARENTS STILL THERE?

1848
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
>> THERE PARENTS THERE, YES.

1849
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU.

1850
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU.

1851
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
>> WHEN DID YOU REALIZE THE

1852
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
MAGNITUDE?

1853
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?

1854
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
>> MINUTES AFTER THE OFFICERS

1855
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
WERE THERE THEY REALIZED WHAT A

1856
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
HORRIFIC SCENE WE HAD.

1857
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
[INAUDIBLE]
>> I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

1858
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
TIMELINE ON THAT.

1859
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
OFFICERS RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY

1860
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
AND AS SOON AS THEY REALIZED

1861
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
WHAT THEY HAD, WE ASKED FOR THE

1862
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000

01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
THANK YOU.

1865
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000

1866
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000

SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN U.S.

1886
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
HISTORY.

1887
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
A TRAGEDY SO WRENCHING IT

1888
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
REDUCED THE PRESIDENT OF THE

1889
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
UNITED STATES TO TEARS.

1890
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
RIGHT NOW 27 PEOPLE ARE

MASSACRE.

1894

20 CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS AND

1895
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER.

1896
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
ALL OF THIS HAPPENING WITHIN A

1897
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
MATTER OF A FEW HOURS.

1898
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
WATCH THIS.

1899
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF THIS

1900
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
TRAGEDY AS IT PLAYED OUT.

1901
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
>> WHEN I WAS GETTING IN MY CAR,

1902
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I HEARD SIRENS GOING OFF

1903
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
CONTINUOUSLY.
CAR AFTER CAR AFTER CAR.

1904
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
SOME OF THEM WERE FLYING PAST MY

1905
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
HOUSE AND COMING AROUND AGAIN

1906
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
AND GOING TO THE SCHOOL.

1907
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
THIS HOUSE IS THREE HOUSES AWAY

1908
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.

1909
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
>> WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED, THERE

1910
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
WAS NOT A LOT OF SECURITY TO

1911
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
GUARD.
THERE WERE THREE CHILDREN THAT

1912
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
CAME OUT.

1913
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
ONE OF THEM HAD A VERY BLEED

1914
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
FACE.

1915
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
>> HE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED IN THE

1916
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
CAR AND HEADED DOWN HERE.

1917
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
IT'S TROUBLING.

1918
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
IT WAS MAYHEM IN THE ROOM WITH

1919
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
THE KIDS AND THE TEACHERS AND

1920
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
TRYING TO IDENTIFY YOUR KID AND

1921
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
MAKING SURE THEY ARE AND FINDING

1922
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
OUT WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND

1923
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
MAKING SURE EVERYONE WAS SAFE.

1924
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
IT STARTED WITH THE NEIGHBORS

1925
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
AND THE REST OF THEIR FRIENDS.

1926
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR DAUGHTER SAY TO

1927
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
YOU?

1928
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
>> THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY CRYING.

1929
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
PETRIFIED OF WHAT HAPPENED AND

1930
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
WHAT DID IT MEAN AND THEY ARE

1931
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
OLDER THAN THE OTHER KIDS IN THE

1932
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
SCHOOL SO UNDERSTANDING WHAT

1933
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
HAPPENED, MY SON WAS IN THE GYM

1934
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

1935
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I THINK THEY HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

1936
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
>> WE SAW POLICE OFFICERS AND

1937
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
HEARD THEM ON THE ROOF AND IN

1938
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
OUR BUILDING.

1939
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
>> DID YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS OR

1940
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

1941
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
>> THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE KIND

1942
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
OF.
THERE WERE POLICE OFFICERS OUT

1943
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
THE DOOR TRYING TO FIND THE GUY.

1944
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.

1945
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I GOT THE CALL AT WORK THIS

1946
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
MORNING.

1947
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE A SMALL DOWN

1948
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE ANYTHING

1949
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
LIKE THIS HAPPEN.

1950
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
TO BE IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

1951
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
IT'S UNHEARD OF.

1952
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
>> IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

1953
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S EVEN

1954
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
POSSIBLE.
YOU READ IT IN THE NEWSPAPER OR

1955
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
SEE IT IN THE NEWS AND YOU ARE

1956
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
LIKE MY GOD, THAT POOR FAMILY.

1957
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING HAPPEN

1958
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
SO CLOSE TO HOME.

1959
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I THINK I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

1960
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR

1961
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE

01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
VICTIMS OF THIS TERRIBLE

1963
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
INCIDENT.
VERY TRAGIC.

1964
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
OUR POLICE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING

1965
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
CLOSELY WITH THE NEWTOWN POLICE

1966
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
DEPARTMENT AND MUTUAL AIDE THAT

1967
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE ASSETS THEY

1968
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
MAY NOT HAVE ALONG WITH THE

1969
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
STATE POLICE THAT HAVE TAKEN THE

1970
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
LEAD IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

1971
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
>> IT WAS TERRIFYING AND I'M

1972
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
STILL IN SHOCK ABOUT IT ALL.

1973
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
>> WAS EVERYBODY CRYING AND

1974
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
SCARE AND WANT THEIR PARENTS TO

1975
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
COME GET THEM?
>> YEAH, THEY WERE AND SOME

1976
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
PEOPLE WERE EVEN LIKE KIND OF
FELT LIKE THEY GOT A STOMACH

1977
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
ACHE.
>> THEY WOULDN'T LET US IN THE

1978
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
BUILDING.

1979
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
ONE OF THE COPS SAID IT WAS THE

1980
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
WORST THING HE HAD SEEN IN HIS

1981
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
ENTIRE CAREER.

1982
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
WHEN THEY TOLD THE PARENTS AND

1983
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE

1984
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
CHILDREN TO COME OUT AND THEY

1985
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.

1986
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
THERE IS 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

1987
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE
DEAD.

1988
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

1989
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
>> AWFUL.

1990
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW AWFUL IT

1991
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
MUST BE FOR THE PARENTS AND

1992
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
LOVED ONES AND THE FAMILY

1993
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
MEMBERS IN THE SMALL TOWN OF

1994
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.
THIS IS A SMALL ELEMENTARY

01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
SCHOOL.
GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH

FOURTH GREAT.

1997
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
5 THROUGH 10-YEAR-OLDS.

1998
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
20 OF THEM GUNNED DOWN BY A

HOME WE BELIEVE.

2003
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
IS THAT CORRECT?

2004
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

2005
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
WE JUST LEFT THE LOCATION AND WE

2006
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
HAD BEEN THERE SEVERAL HOURS

2007
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.

2008
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
THE INVESTIGATION STRETCHED TO

2009
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
THAT HOME AND IT'S BEING TREAT

2010
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
SAID AS A CRIME SCENE.

2011
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
WE FOUND S.W.A.T. TEAMS AND WE

2012
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
CAN TELL YOU THAT THE RESIDENTS

2013
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000

EVACUATE EARLIER TODAY.

2015
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
WE TALKED TO ONE NEIGHBOR WHO

2016
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
SAID SHE WAS TOLD AROUND 11:00

2017
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
THIS MORNING BY POLICE TO GET

2018
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000

2019
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
SHE IS OUT OF HER HOME ABLE TO

2020
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
GET INTO HER HOUSE.

2021
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
AS FAR AS WHAT WE SAW, THEY ARE

2022
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
BEING TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT THAT

2023
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
LOCATION WHERE THE INVESTIGATION

2024
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
HAD CONTINUED.

2025
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN ADDITION

2026
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
S.W.A.T. TEAMS, WE DID SEE AN

2027
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
AMBULANCE AT ONE POINT WHILE WE

2028
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000

2029
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000

2030
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
NEIGHBORS WERE NUMB REALLY.

01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
A NUMBER OF THEM COULDN'T EVEN

2032
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
TALK TO US.

2033
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
THEY ARE SO FILLED WITH EMOTION.

2034
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
ONE NEIGHBOR DID TALK TO US.

2035
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
SHE KNEW THE FAMILY OF THE

2036
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
SUSPECT AND DESCRIBED HIM AS

2037
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
TROUBLE AND DIDN'T ELABORATE

2038
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
FURTHER THAN THAT.

2039
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
IT IS BEING PUT TOGETHER WITH

2040
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
THE SUSPECT'S FAMILY.

2041
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT OUTSIDE

2042
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000

WALK US THROUGH WHAT WE KNOW AT

2048
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
THIS POINT.
ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT TO

2049
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
CHANGE.

2050
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
THE INFORMATION IS STILL COMING

2052
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000

2053
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO

2054
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
CAUTION ABOUT THIS.

2055
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000

2056
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I COVERED AN AWFUL LOT OF SCHOOL

2057
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
SHOOTINGS OVER THE YEARS AND THE

2058
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
EARLY INFORMATION ALWAYS SEEMS

2059
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
TO CHANGE.

2060
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

2061
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
TIMELINE OF THE SHOOTINGS AS

01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000

01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
SCHOOL AS BEST WE CAN PIECE IT

2065
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
TOGETHER.
REMEMBER THIS IS JUST A VERY

2066
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
ROUGH APPROXIMATATION.

2067
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
ABOUT 9:30 THIS MORNING, CLASS

2068
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
HAS BEEN UNDER WAY FOR ABOUT A

2069
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
HALF HOUR.

2070
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
MORE THAN 600 STUDENTS, THE

2071
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL AND VICE

2072
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

2073
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND SEVERAL OTHER

2074
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
ADULTS WERE HAVING A MEETING UP

2075
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
HERE IN THIS PART OF THE SCHOOL.

2076
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
THEY GATHERED NEAR THE OFFICE

2077
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
AREA AT THAT TIME.

2078
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
AROUND 9:40 ACCORDING TO WHAT A

2079
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
LOT OF EYEWITNESSS HAVE TO SAY

2080
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
IS WHEN IT APPEARED THE GUNMAN

2081
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
ENTERS THE BUILDING.

2082
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW.

2083
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
WE KNOW THAT LATER TODAY POLICE

2084
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
WERE LOOKING AT A CAR OUT HERE

2085
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
PARKED BY A FIRE LANE.

2086
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
BASED ON WHAT EYEWITNESSS SAID,

2087
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
THERE WAS A GOOD REASON TO THINK

2088
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
HE CAME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

2089
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
INTO THIS AREA.

2090
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
WE DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE, BUT

2091
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT.

2092
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
RIGHT AWAY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT

2093
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
THIS ENTIRE BUILDING STARTED

2094
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
HEARING SHOTS.

2095
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
SOME CASES THEY SAID IT SOUNDED

2096
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
LIKE BANGS OR SOMEONE HAMMERING.

2097
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
PEOPLE STARTED SAYING THEY COULD

2098
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
HEAR SOMETHING.

2099
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
BY 9:41 OR SO, CALLS WERE COMING

2100
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
INTO 911.

2101
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

2102
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
PSYCHOLOGIST ACCORDING TO

2103
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
WITNESSES WERE IN A MEETING IN

2104
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
THIS PART OF THE BUILDING CAME

2105
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
OUT OF THAT MEETING AND THEY GO

2106
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
TOWARDS THE GUNFIRE OUT HERE IN

2107
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
A HALL WAY.

2108
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
HERE OR HERE.

2109
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
THEY GO OUT THERE AND THE PEOPLE

2110
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
IN THE ROOM SAY THEY HEAR MANY,

2111
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
MANY MORE SHOTS AND A LOT OF

2112
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
SHOUTING AND THE VICE PRINCIPAL

2113
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
COMES BACK IN WOUNDED.

2114
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
THE OTHER TWO DO NOT.

2115
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
AUTHORITIES SAY THE SHOOTING

2116
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED IN A

2117
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

2118
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
AND THE GUNMAN DOES NOT ROAM

2119
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
AROUND AND STAYS RIGHT IN THE

2120
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
AREA HERE.

2121
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
YOU HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN

2122
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
FROM THE OFFICER THERE.

2123
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
TWO ROOMS IS WHERE IT ALL

2124
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
HAPPENED.

2125
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
AROUND 9:45 OR SO, TEACHERS IN

2126
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
THE REST OF THE BUILDING FROM

2127
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
ALL WE CAN HEAR FROM STUDENTS

2128
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN
ABOUT IT ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN

2129
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
TO PROTECT THEIR STUDENTS.

2130
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING

2131
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
ON.

2132
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
THEY WERE NEAR THE GYM AND TOLD

2133
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
TO HIDE IN CLOSETS AND THAT SORT

2134
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
OF THING.
OTHERS IT APPEARS THE SCHOOL

2135
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
WENT INTO LOCKDOWN, BUT THEY

2136
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
STARTED LEADING STUDENTS AWAY

2137
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.

2138
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I'M NOT SURE OF THE TIMELINE,

2139
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
BUT WE KNOW THAT BY THE TIME THE

2140
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
OFFICERS SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE,

2141
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
YOU STARTED HAVING A SITUATION

2142
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
WHERE STUDENTS WERE BEING LED

2143
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
AWAY BY OFFICERS AND TEACHERS

2144
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
AND EVERYBODY WHO COULD TRY TO

2145
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
GET THEM OUT TO SAFETY.

2146
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
SOMETIME LATER, WE WILL PUT IT

2147
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
AT 9:50, BUT WE DON'T REALLY

2148
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
KNOW BECAUSE IT'S MURKY AND WE

2149
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
WILL GET CLARITY OVERTIME.

2150
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW OR WHEN THE

2151
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
GUNMAN DIES.

2152
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
WE KNOW OFFICERS SAID NO OFFICER

2153
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
FIRED A GUN THAT LEADS YOU TO

2154
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
BELIEVE HE SHOT HIMSELF.

2155
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.

2156
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
AS OFFICERS ARRIVE ON THE SCENE,

2157
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
THEY IMMEDIATELY TAKE CONTROL OF

2158
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

2159
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
THEY SPREAD OUT AND SECURING

2160
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
ROOMS AND MAKING SURE THEY KNOW

2161
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
THAT IF THEY HAVE THE FUNMAN,

2162
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
IT'S 1 AND THERE IS NOT SOMEONE

2163
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
ELSE.
THEY ARE LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR

2164
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
THE POCKETS OF CHILDREN.

2165
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
THEY KNOW THERE KIDS HIDDEN IN

2166
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
THE BUILDING.

2167
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
IN ALL THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS I

2168
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
HAVE SEEN, THIS IS A COMMON

2169
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
OCCURRENCE AND THE SHOOTING

2170
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
BEGINS WITH MANY TEACHERS

2171
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
HELPING THEM AND GO INTO HIDING.

2172
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
THAT IS A VERY, VERY DANGEROUS

2173
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
SITUATION WHEN THE OFFICERS GO

2174
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
INTO THE BUILDING.
I HAD OFFICERS SAY YOU HAVE

2175
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
PEOPLE POPPING OUT BEHIND YOU

2176
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
WHO WERE IN CLOSETS AND ROOMS

2177
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
AND THE OFFICERS HAVE TO BE
PROFESSIONAL AND CALM TO GET

2178
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
THROUGH THAT AND CONTROL THE

2179
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
SITUATION.
THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT THEY DID

2180
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
AND AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE A

2181
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
SITUATION WHERE YOU WERE ABLE TO

2182
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
SEE THE OF OFFICERS SECURING THE

2183
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
PROPERTY ALL-AROUND AND TRYING

2184
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN SEE THAT

2185
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
THE GUNMAN WAS THERE AND LEADING

2186
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
THE KIDS OUT AS WE HEARD PASSED

2187
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
ACTUAL VICTIMS OF THE SHOOTING.

2188
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
AGAIN, ALL OF THE TIMELINE IS

2189
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
VERY, VERY TENTATIVE RIGHT NOW

2190
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
AND WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT

2191
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
MORE, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT

2192
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
LOOKS LIKE IT TOOK MAYBE 20 OR

2193
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
30 MINUTES AT MOST FROM

2194
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
BEGINNING TO END FROM THE TIME

2195
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
TO SHOOTER WALKED IN TO THE TIME

2196
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
THE POLICE OFFICERS ESSENTIALLY

2197
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
HAD EVERYTHING SECURED AND WERE

2198
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
GOING THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THEY

2199
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
HAD EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF AND

2200
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
THE KIDS CLEARED OUT.

2201
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
THAT'S A LONG PROCESS THAT IS

2202
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
GOING ON ALL DAY.

2203
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
>> DURING THE FEW MINUTES, 26

2204
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
PEOPLE WERE MURDERED.

2205
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
SIX ADULTS AND 20 YOUNG

2206
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
CHILDREN.
WHAT A HORRIFIC STORY.

2207
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.

2208
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
LET'S GO TO THE SCENE RIGHT NOW

2209
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2210
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
SUSAN CANN

2211
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
SUSAN CANNED LOTIY IS THERE.

2212
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
>> I LEARNED THAT THE MOTHER OF

2213
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER WHO HAS

2214
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NANCY LANZA

2215
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
WAS FOUND DEAD.

2216
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT NO

2217
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
PHYSICAL BODY WAS FOUND IN

2218
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
ANOTHER HOME IN HOBOKEN, NEW

2219
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
JERSEY.

2220
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER PUBLISHED

2221
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
REPORTS ABOUT THAT.

2222
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
TWO SOURCES DO TELL US THAT

2223
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
SOMEONE WAS TAKEN AWAY FOR

2224
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
QUESTIONING FROM THAT HOUSE IN

2225
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY AND THAT

2226
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
CONCERN IS BELIEVED TO BE THE

2227
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
SUSPECT'S BROTHER IN THIS CASE.

2228
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
IN OTHER WORDS, THE BROTHER OF

2229
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
THE SUSPECTED DEAD SHOOTER IN

2230
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
THIS SCHOOL SHOOTING.

2231
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
THE SHOOTER HAS BEEN DESCRIBED

2232
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
TO ME AS HAVING WORN OR DRESSED

2233
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
IN BLACK BATTLE FATIGUES AND A

2234
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
MILITARY VEST WHEN HE CAME INTO

2235
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
THE SCHOOL AND BEGAN FIRING

2236
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
AWAY.
I KNOW ACCORDING TO SOURCES THAT

2237
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
AT LEAST THREE WEAPONS HAVE BEEN

2238
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
RECOVERED.
ONE DESCRIBED AS A MODEL 223

2239
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
BUSH WACKER, A MILITARY STYLE

2240
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC GUN.

2241
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
SOME OF THE AMMO IS USED IN

2242
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
AFGHANISTAN BY OUR SOLDIERS

2243
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
THERE.
THAT TWO OTHER GUNS WERE ALSO

2244
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
FOUND THAT ARE DESCRIBED AS HAND

2245
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
GUNS.
ONE A GLOCK.

2246
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE

2247
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
MOTHER WHO WAS A TEACHER AT THAT

2248
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
SCHOOL WAS FOUND DEAD AT HER

2249
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
HOME WHERE MARY SNOW IS OUTSIDE

2250
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
THAT HOME BECAUSE ORIGINALLY WE

2251
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
THOUGHT THE MOTHER WAS ENGINE

2252
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
THE CLASSROOM WHERE THE GUNMAN

2253
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
OPENED FIRE.

2254
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
>> EARLIER WE HAD INFORMATION

2255
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
THAT SHE WAS FOUND IN THE

2256
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
CLASSROOM, HOWEVER NOW I'M TOLD

2257
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
THAT IN FACT HER BODY WAS FOUND

2258
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
AT THE SUSPECT'S RESIDENCE HERE

2259
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA.

2260
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE ALSO

2261
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
LIVED THERE.
WE DON'T KNOW.

2262
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW THE TIMELINE.

2263
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
WHEN WAS SHE KILLED?

2264
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
WAS SHE KILLED BEFORE THE

2265
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
SHOOTING BEGAN AT THE SCHOOL?

2266
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT

2267
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
AUTHORITIES ARE STILL TRYING TO

2268
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
PIECE TOGETHER.

2269
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
ALSO WE HAVE CONFLICTING

2270
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHOOTER'S

2271
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
NAME.
WE HAVE HAD THE NAME FOR QUITE

2272
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
SOMETIME AND THERE IS SOME

2273
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE

2274
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
SHOOTER IS DESCRIBED -- WHICH

2275
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
BROTHER'S NAME IS WHICH.

2276
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
WE HAVE THEIR AGES AND THE

2277
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
NAMES, BUT WE ARE TRYING TO SORT

2278
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
THAT OUT.

2279
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
OFFICIALS HAVE YET TO OFFICIALLY

2280
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
RELEASE THAT YET.

2281
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
>> THIS KIND OF STORY, IT'S NOT

2282
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
UNUSUAL THAT CONFLICTING

2283
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000

2286
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
INITIAL REPORTS PROVE TO BE

2287
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
INACCURATE.

2288
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
WE ARE GETTING CONFLICTED

2289
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
INFORMATION.
WE WILL PIECE IT TOGETHER IN

2290
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
ABOUT 20 OR 25 MINUTES.

2291
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

2292
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
WILL HAVE ANOTHER BRIEFING AND

2293
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
MAYBE WE WILL GET MORE DETAILED

2294
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000

2304
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
>>> I SAW SOME OF THE BULLETS

2305
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
GOING PAST THE HALL THAT I WAS

2306
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
RIGHT NEXT TO AND THEN A TEACHER

2307
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
PULLED ME INTO HER CLASSROOM.

2308
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000

2309
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
>> YES.

2310
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000

>> IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE WAS

2312
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
KICKING A DOOR.

2313
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
>> IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE GUN

2314
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
SHOUTS?
>> NO, IT DIDN'T.

2315
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
>> THAT WAS A YOUNG BOY FROM THE

2316
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2317
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
HIS PARENTS ARE THERE WHEN OUR

2318
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
AFFILIATES ARE THERE AND WHEN WE

2319
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
SPEAK TO THEM, WE ONLY DO IT

WE WENT THROUGH POINT BY POINT

2326
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000

THE TEACHERS WERE OVER THERE AT

2327
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000

KIDS AS WE WATCHED AND MORE

2331
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000

OUR LOCAL AFFILIATE WATCHED WHAT

01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
WAS GOING ON AND CAUGHT UP WITH

2333
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
A MOTHER WHO WAS THANKFUL TO THE

01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
TEACHER WHO SAVED HER SON'S

2335
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
LIFE.

2336
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000

01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
TEACHER.
>> SHE SAVED HIS LIFE?

2338
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
>> SHE DEFINITELY DID.

2339
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
SHE PULLED HIM AND ANOTHER CHILD

2340
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
INTO THE CLASSROOM.

2341
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
>> WHAT ARE COULD HAVE DRIVEN A

2342
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
MAN TO OPEN FIRE ON DEFENSELESS

2343
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
CHILDREN?

2344
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I AM JOINED BY A PSYCHIATRIST

2345
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
AND CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT

2346
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
DR. SANJAY GUPTA.

2347
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
YOU ARE A HIGHLY TRAINED MEDICAL

2348
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
PROFESSIONAL AND WALK THROUGH

2349
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN

2350
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
YOU HEAR THE DETAILS OF A MASS

2351
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
KILLING LIKE THIS IN AN

2352
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2353
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
>> I THINK FOR MOST OF US HERE

2354
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
IN LOS ANGELES, YOU THINK ABOUT

2355
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
YOUR OWN CHILDREN.

2356
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
THESE EVENTS MAKE YOU WANT TO

2357
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
HUG YOUR KIDS A BIT TIGHTER

2358
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
TONIGHT.
I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AS YOU

2359
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
KNOW, WOLF, AND HAVING COVERED

2360
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
SO MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES AS

2361
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
HAVE YOU, IT IS COMMON FOR LOTS

2362
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

2363
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
AROUND THE WORLD WHO WERE NOT

2364
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
INVOLVED WITH THIS TO HAVE

2365
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
SYMPTOMS AND TO REALLY BE

2366
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
AFFECTED BY THIS.

2367
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
IN MANY WAYS.

2368
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH

2369
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
THE SAME THING.

2370
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
YOUR COMMUNITY AND THE PEOPLE

2371
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
AROUND YOU BECOME A REAL SENSE

2372
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
OF SUPPORT.

2373
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
IF PEOPLE DEVELOP THESE SYMPTOMS

2374
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
AND IT CAN LAST FOR DAYS.

2375
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
IF THEY DEVELOP INTO NIGHTMARES

2376
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
OR ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION, IT IS

2377
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
TIME TO SEE SOMEBODY AND GET

2378
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
HELP.
THERE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO

2379
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
NEED THAT AS A RESULT OF WHAT

2380
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
HAPPENED.
WOLF, SOMETHING YOU TALKED

2381
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
ABOUT, WE TALKED ABOUT TOGETHER.

2382
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
S THAT THIS NOTION THAT WE THINK

2383
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
OF MENTAL HEALTH AS BEING VAGUE

2384
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
AND HARDER TO TARGET AND PREDICT

2385
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
AND HARDER TO TREAT.

2386
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY WE THINK OF

2387
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
HEART DISEASE OR CANCER, THEY

2388
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
CAN BE PREDICTED AND CAN BE

2389
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
TREATED.
ONE OF THE THIRST THINGS THAT

2390
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
WENT THROUGH MY MIND IS THIS IS

2391
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
A REMINDER.

2392
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
>> LISA IS HERE.

2393
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
SO MANY EXPERTS SAID AFTER OTHER

2394
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
KILLINGS ALONG THIS LINE OVER

2395
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
THE YEARS, THERE THESE WARNING

2396
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
SIGNS AND A LOT OF FOLKS AND

2397
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T PAY

2398
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
ATTENTION.
>> THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY FAIR.

2399
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

2400
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR

2401
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
25 YEARS.

2402
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
THERE PLENTY OF FAMILIES WHO ARE

2403
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
DISTRAUGHT AND HAVE MEMBERS OF

2404
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
THEIR FAMILY WHO ARE CHILDREN

2405
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
THAT THEY KNOW ARE DANGEROUS AND

2406
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
LIVE WITH THIS ANGUISH OF NOT

2407
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR

2408
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
THEM FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AND

2409
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
YEARS.

2410
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
THE REALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE THE

2411
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
LEGISLATION THAT A LLLOWS THE

2412
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
OFFICIALS TO DO WHAT MUST BE

2413
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
DONE UNTIL THE PERSON COMMITTED

2414
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
A CRIME AND THAT'S WHAT WHEN

2415
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
THEY COME TO THE ATTENTION.

2416
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
IT'S NOT TRUE THAT PEOPLE ARE IN

2417
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
DENIAL.

2418
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
>> WHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS

2419
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO

2420
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
START KILLING KIDS?

2421
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
>> THERE PLENTY OF FAMILIES WHO

2422
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
DO RESPOND TO THE WARNING SIGNS

2423
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
AND WILL CALL THE AUTHORITIES.

2424
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
>> WHAT ARE THEY?

2425
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
>> THEY WILL SEE A CHILD IS

2426
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
ANGRY, ISOLATED, CLEARLY

2427
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
POTENTIALLY RESPONDING TO OUGHT

2428
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
TORI HALLUCINATIONS AND HEAR

2429
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
VOICES AND MAYBE A FASCINATION

2430
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
WITH GUNS AND MAYBE AT A

2431
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
SHOOTING RANGE.

2432
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
THEY KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG.

2433
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
YOU CAN'T CALL AND SAY MY SON IS

2434
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
ACTING WEIRD, HE NEEDS HELP.

2435
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
THEY DON'T HAVE JUSTIFICATION.

2436
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, IT IS

2437
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO INTERVENE

2438
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
IN A WAY THAT CAN PROTECT OUR

2439
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
SOCIETY.
THE LEGISLATION HAS TO BE

2440
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
CHANGED SO WE ACT BEFORE A

2441
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
CRIME.

2442
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
>> SANJAY, YOU STUDY THE BRAIN

2443
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
ALL THE TIME.

2444
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
ARE THERE CHEMICAL IMBALANCES

2445
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
HERE AND CHEMICAL PROBLEMS THAT

2446
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
COULD CREATE A KILLER LIKE THIS?

2447
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
>> I THINK SO AND I AGREE WITH

2448
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
YOUR GUEST AS WELL.

2449
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
THESE THINGS USED TO BE IN THE

2450
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
REALM OF THE ANECDOTAL AND THERE

2451
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
IS EVIDENCE OF WHAT WE CAN SEE

2452
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
HAPPENING IN THE BRAIN.

2453
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

2454
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
PREDISPOSED OR SET UP FOR IT AND

2455
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
SOMETHING PUSHES THEM OVER THE

2456
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
EDGE.

2457
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
IT IS CLEAR AND MOST OF THESE

2458
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
SITUATIONS.

2459
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I THINK THAT TO THINK OF MENTAL

2460
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
ILLNESS AS A DISEASE AND WHEN

2461
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THAT, IT

2462
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
CHANGES EVERYONE'S PERSPECTIVE

2463
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT MORE LIKE

2464
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
YOU WOULD THINK OF SOMEONE WITH

2465
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
HEART PROBLEMS OR CANCER OR

2466
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
DIABETES.
IT CHANGES PERSPECTIVE OF HOW

2467
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
YOU POTENTIALLY THINK ABOUT IT

2468
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
AND GETTING IT DIAGNOSED AND

2469
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
TREATED.
I AGREE WITH THE GUESTS.

2470
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
IT'S HARD TO DO.

2471
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SHOWING

2472
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
UP AND TAKING A FAMILY MEMBER

2473
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
AWAY, BUT SOMEONE BEING ABLE TO

2474
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
TALK ABOUT IT OPENLY AND MAKE

2475
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
SURE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND

2476
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
THEY CAN GO SEE SOMEBODY.

2477
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
IT'S NOT EASY AND NOT EVEN

2478
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
AVAILABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE AROUND

2479
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
THE COUNTRY.

2480
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
>> IF NO ONE COMMITTED A CRIME

2481
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
AND THERE SIGNS OUT THERE,

2482
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
LETTERS AND I WANT TO GO OUT

2483
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
THERE AND KILL PEOPLE AND THEY

2484
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
ARE GOING TO PRACTICE RANGES, IS

2485
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
IT USUALLY AN INDICATION OF A

2486
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEM THAT CAN BE

2487
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
TREATED FOR EXAMPLE WITH
MEDICINE?

2488
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
>> SURE IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO

2489
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
TAKE IT.
USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSON

2490
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
LIKE THAT, THEY WON'T

2491
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS ANYTHING

2492
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
WRONG.
TRY GETTING THEM INTO TREATMENT

2493
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
AND GETTING THEM TO TAKE THE

2494
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
PILL.
THEY WON'T DO IT.

2495
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
NOT EVERYBODY IS OUT THERE DOING

2496
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
THIS, BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO, IT'S

2497
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOST LIKELY

2498
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
REFUSED TREATMENT.
I WILL BET YOU ANYTHING THAT

2499
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE

2500
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
TALKING ABOUT AND THE ONE PERSON

2501
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WAS

2502
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
CLEARLY TO HIS FAMILY A DANGER

2503
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
AND THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

2504
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
TO DO.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE LEGISLATION

2505
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM, TO BACK

2506
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
THEM UP TO TAKE ACTION.

2507
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I WILL AT THIS.

2508
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
A NUMBER OF DECADES AGO, WE WERE

2509
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
FEARFUL THAT PEOPLE BE INTO A

2510
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY WERE
DIFFERENT.

2511
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
WE WANTED TO PROTECT THEM AND WE

2512
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
ENACTED LAWS TO PROTECT PEOPLE.

2513
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
WE HAD GONE TOO FAR IN THAT

2514
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
DIRECTION.

2515
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
NOW WE HAVE TO FACE THE REALITY.

2516
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE TO STEP

2517
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
UP OUR WORK AND GETTING PEOPLE

2518
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
INTO TREATMENT WHEN THEY NEED

2519
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
IT.
LETTING DOCTORS MAKE THE

2520
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
DECISIONS AND NOT JUST LAWYERS

2521
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
AND JUDGES.

2522
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
>> THANKS FOR THAT EXPERTISE.

2523
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
SANJAY, THANKS TO YOU AS WELL.

2524
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
LET'S BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON

2525
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IN THE

2526
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
DEADLY SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

2527
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WE ARE AWAITING A LIVE PRESS

2528
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
CONFERENCE COMING UP BEFORE THE

2529
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
TOP OF THE HOUR.

2530
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

2531
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
27 PEOPLE ARE CONFIRMED DEAD.

2532
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
20 CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS AND

2533
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER.

2534
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
WE JUST LEARNED THAT THE MOTHER

2535
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
OF THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER WAS

2536
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
FOUND DEAD IN HER SON'S HOME

2537
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
NEAR THE SCHOOL.

2538
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
WE ALSO HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A

2539
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
SOURCE THAT NOBODY HAS BEEN

2540
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
FOUND IN A HOUSE SEARCHED BY

2541
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
AUTHORITIES IN HOBOKEN, NEW

2542
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
JERSEY ALTHOUGH THE SEARCH

2543
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
CONTINUES.
A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAID

2544
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
THE GUNMAN WAS DRESSED IN WHAT

2545
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
ARE DESCRIBED AS BLACK BATTLE

2546
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
FATIGUES AND A MILITARY VEST.

2547
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
THE SOURCE SAID THE SEMI

2548
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPON WAS FOUND ALONG

2549
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
WITH TWO HAND GUNS.

2550
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
THE CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR DAN

2551
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
MALLOY HAS BEEN MEETING WITH THE

2552
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN KILLED

2553
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
IN THE HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND

2554
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
SPOKE OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

2555
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

2556
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

2557
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT

2558
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
TRANSPIRED AT THE SCHOOL

2559
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

2560
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

2561
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
IMPACTED.

2562
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I ONLY ASK THAT ALL OF OUR

2563
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
FELLOW CITIZENS IN THE UNITED
STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD WHO

2564
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
HAVE OFFERED THEIR ASSISTANCE

2565
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
REMEMBER ALL OF THE VICTIMS IN

2566
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
THEIR PRAYERS.

01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000

01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000

2570
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
AFTER I'M DONE SPEAKING, A

2571
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE

01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000

GIVE YOU ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

2574
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
EARLIER A NUMBER OF OUR

2575
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
CITIZENS, BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN HAD

2576
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
THEIR LIFE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM

2577
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
AS WELL AS ADULTS WHOSE

2578
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO EDUCATE

2579
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
AND SUPERVISE THOSE CHILDREN.

2580
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
>> CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR DAN

2581
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
MALLOY.
WE ARE AWAITING A PRESS BRIEFING

2582
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
BY THE STATE POLICE THAT IS

2583
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE

2584
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
TOP OF THE HOUR.

2585
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
CNN'S ASHLEIGH BANFIELD IS IN

2586
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT AND JOINS

2587
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
US ONCE AGAIN.

2588
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF

2589
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
THE MOOD OF WHAT YOU ARE FEELING

2590
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
OVER THERE AND SEEING.

2591
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
>> Reporter:

2592
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
>> IT SEEMS EVERY TEN MINUTES

2593
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
THERE IS ANOTHER DOZEN OR SO

2594
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
REPORTERS AND TRUCKS AND GEAR
THAT SHOWS UP.

2595
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN

2596
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF NATIONAL

2597
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
AND INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE AS

2598
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES START TO

2599
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
RESPOND TO THIS.

2600
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
IT'S OBVIOUS FROM THE NUMBER OF

2601
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO REPORT

2602
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
IT HOW HARD HITTING THIS HAS

2603
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
BEEN FOR SO MANY PEOPLE.

2604
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW MECHANICS

2605
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,000
OF HOW THINGS ARE PLAYING OUT.

2606
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
AS NIGHTFALLS OVER THE TOWN, THE

2607
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
FIREHOUSE HAS BEEN A CENTER FOR

2608
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
THE PARENTS AND DAN MALLOY, THE

2609
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
GOVERNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS THE ONE

2610
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
WHO BROKE IT TO MANY OF THE

2611
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
PARENTS WHO WERE STILL WAITING

2612
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
THERE EARLIER THIS EVENING AND

2613
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
HAD NOT BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR

2614
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
CHILDREN.

2615
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
HE BROKE IT TO THE PARENTS THAT

2616
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN REUNITED BY

2617
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
NOW, IT'S OVER.

2618
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
THE PROBLEM IS THEY CAN'T MAKE A

2619
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
POSITIVE AND FORMAL

2620
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
NOTIFICATION.
AS YOU HEARD THE STATE POLICE

2621
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
SAYING EARLIER, THE ID PROCESS

2622
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
IS GOING TO BE AN OVERWHELMING

2623
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
TASK WITH THAT MANY TINY BODIES

2624
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
AND THOSE SIX ADULTS AS WELL.

2625
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
18 LITTLE BODIES THAT HAVE TO BE

2626
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
IDENTIFIED IS A MASSIVE CRIME

2627
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
SCENE AND A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING.

2628
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
IT UNDOUBTEDLY WILL GO ON

2629
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ANOTHER

2630
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
DETAIL.

2631
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
THE PRINCIPAL IS ONE OF THE

2632
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
VICTIMS.
SHE HAD JUST THIS FALL

2633
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
INSTITUTED A BRAND-NEW SECURITY

2634
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
SYSTEM AT THE SCHOOL IN WHICH

2635
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
LIKE IN MANY SCHOOLS IF YOU WANT

2636
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
TO VISIT THE SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO

2637
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
HIT A BUZZER.

2638
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
YOU ARE SEEN BY AN ELECTRONIC

2639
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
SYSTEM AND BE BUZZED IN.

2640
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
THOSE LOCKDOWN BY 9:30.

2641
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
BEFORE 9:30 YOU CAN GO IN AND

2642
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
OUT.
AFTER 9:30, IT'S THE BUZZ IN

2643
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
PROCESS.
POSSIBLY HE GOT IN BEFORE THAT

2644
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
HAPPENED AND WHO KNOWS SINCE HE

2645
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
A CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL

2646
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
ACCORDING TO POLICE THAT IT

2647
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY ACCESS

2648
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
ANYWAY.
A BASKETBALL COACH AT THE SCHOOL

2649
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
TOLD HIM HE HAD TWO CHILDREN IN

2650
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
THE SCHOOL.

2651
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
THEY ARE OKAY, BUT THEY ARE

2652
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
TERRIFIED TONIGHT.

2653
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
COLOR FROM THE PARENTS WHO ARE

2654
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
COMING OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND ARE

2655
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

2656
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT.

2657
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
OF COURSE THIS REPORTING FROM

2658
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
OUR SUSAN CANDIOTTI SAYING THE

2659
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER WAS FOUND

2660
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
IN HER SON'S RESIDENCE.

2661
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES

2662
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
TOGETHER, BUT THE STATE POLICE

2663
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
ANNOUNCED EARLIER THAT THE

2664
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
SHOOTER HAD TARGETED A PERSON

2665
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
THAT HE LIVED WITH.

2666
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
IT WAS A FAMILY MEMBER HE LIVED

2667
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
WITH.
WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS THE

2668
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
MOTHER'S RESIDENCE, THE

2669
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER WHO

2670
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE

2671
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
SHOOTER, WHETHER IT WAS HERS OR

2672
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
HIS RESIDENCE OR THEY SHARED THE

2673
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
RESIDENCE IS UNCLEAR.

2674
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
THAT IS THE SECONDARY CRIME

2675
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
SCENE HERE IN CONNECTICUT THAT

2676
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO.

2677
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
AS FAR AS HOW THIS NIGHT WILL

2678
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
PROGRESS FOR NOT ONLY THE

2679
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
FAMILIES AFFECTED, BUT THIS

2680
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
TOWN.
THERE TWO VIGILS THAT WILL GET

2681
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
UNDER WAY ABOUT 7:00 TONIGHT AT

2682
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
TWO CHURCHES.

2683
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
WE HAVE SEEN SIGNS ELSEWHERE FOR

2684
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
SMALLER VIGILS AS RESTAURANTS

2685
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
AND BUSINESSES.

2686
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
DEFINITELY TWO AT TWO OF THE

2687
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
CHURCHES HERE IN TOWN THAT

2688
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
SHOULD GET UNDER WAY AT 7:00

2689
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
TONIGHT.

2690
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE THE MOOD

2691
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
FOR YOU.

2692
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I'M SORRY.
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

2693
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
THINK WE WILL ALL KNOW WHERE WE

2694
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
WERE WHEN WE HEARD THE NEWS

2695
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
BREAK.
>> WE WILL AND YOU LIVE NOT THAT

2696
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
FAR AWAY IN CONNECTICUT.

2697
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
GIVE US A LITTLE SENSE OF THIS

2698
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
NEWTOWN THAT MAYBE OUR VIEWERS

2699
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND THE

2700
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
WORLD ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS

2701
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
PART OF CONNECTICUT AND THIS

2702
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
TOWN.

2703
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
>> IT IS VERY REMOTE.

2704
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
EARLIER TODAY WHEN THIS WAS

2705
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
BREAKING, I DESCRIBED IT AS OFF

2706
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
THE GRID.

2707
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
VERY REMOTE AND RURAL.

2708
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
GENTLY ROLLING HILLING AND THICK

2709
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
WOODED AREAS AND LARGE

2710
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
PROPERTIES THAT ARE FEW AND FAR

2711
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
BETWEEN THE POUS HOWS AND SPREAD

2712
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
OUT.
DEFINITELY THE KIND OF PLACE YOU

2713
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
WOULD SAY YOU COULD NEVER

2714
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
IMAGINE IT HAPPENING HERE.

2715
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, BUT

2716
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF PLACE

2717
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
YOU WOULD THINK SOMETHING WOULD
HAPPEN LIKE THIS.

2718
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
NOT ONLY THAT, IT'S REMOTE IN

2719
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
THE SENSE THAT YES, SOME PEOPLE

2720
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
WHO LIVE HERE DO COMMUTE TO NEW

2721
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
YORK CITY FOR WORK, BUT IT'S A

2722
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
LONG COMMUTE.

2723
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I COMMUTE AN HOUR EVERY DAY TO

2724
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
WHERE I LIVE AND THIS IS A SOLID

2725
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
HOUR AND A HALF.

2726
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
IT'S A LONGER COMMUTE, BUT THE

2727
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE LIVE HERE

2728
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
FOR THE SAFETY AND THE SECURITY

2729
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
AND THE TERRIFIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

2730
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THIS IS WHAT YOU HEAR OVER AND

2731
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
OVER.

2732
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
WE CAME HERE BECAUSE IT'S THE

2733
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
PLACE TO BE SAVE AND SECURE AND

2734
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
ENSURE OUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO

2735
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
HAVE A GREAT UPBRINGING.

2736
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR OVER AND

2737
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
OVER.

2738
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
THIS IS SO UNBELIEVABLE THAT

2739
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
THIS CAN HAPPEN IN A PLACE THAT

2740
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
IS LIKE A HELL SCENE WHEN YOU

2741
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
DRIVE THROUGH.
>> THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

2742
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
WILL COME ONCE AGAIN AND BRIEF

2743
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
US ON WHAT'S GOING ON.

2744
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
THEY HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE AND

2745
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
NOT PROVIDING NAMES YET.

2746
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
NOT PROVIDING SPECIFIC

2747
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS AN

2748
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
ONGOING INVESTIGATION AND ONLY

2749
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
JUST BEGINNING.

2750
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
>> YEAH.

2751
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
JUST IMAGINE THE BULLETS THAT

2752
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
WERE DESCRIBED TO US EARLIER

2753
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
TODAY FROM A PARENT WHO WAS IN A

2754
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
MEETING WITH SOME OF THE SCHOOL

2755
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
TEACHERS AND PRINCIPAL AND THE

2756
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND SAID IT

2757
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
SOUNDED AS THOUGH THERE WERE AT

2758
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
LEAST A HUNDRED ROUNDS.

2759
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF

2760
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
INVESTIGATION THAT HAS TO GO ON

2761
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
BEFORE THEY CAN REALLY PIECE

2762
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2763
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
THEY HAVE TO DO THIS.

2764
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE REPORTS THAT

2765
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
THE SHOOTER IS DEAD, THAT DOES

2766
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
HELP IN THE MATTER IN TERMS OF

2767
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
NOT TRYING TO AMOUNT TO

2768
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
PROSECUTION AND COLLECT THAT

2769
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
KIND OF EVIDENCE, BUT LET ME

2770
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
TELL YOU, 18 LITTLE CHILDREN'S

2771
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
BODIES ARE IN THAT SCHOOL RIGHT

2772
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
NOW.

2773
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
TWO ADDITIONAL CHILDREN WERE

2774
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,000
RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL THAT DIED

2775
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
IN THE HOSPITAL.

2776
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
ADULT BODIES ARE HERE AND THE

2777
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
SHOOTER HIMSELF.

2778
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
WHAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN

2779
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
INVESTIGATING THE COLUMBINE

2780
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
MASSACRE AS COMPARED TO THIS

2781
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
ONE, POLICE TELL US IT WAS IN A

2782
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
CONCENTRATED AREA.

2783
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
YOU SAW THE REPORT SHOWING THE

2784
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
LAY OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

2785
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
IT'S ESSENTIALLY TWO ROOMS WHERE

2786
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
MOST OF THE KILLINGS TOOK PLACE.

2787
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I

2788
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
KNOW I'M TALKING ABOUT AN

2789
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE UP AGAINST

2790
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
RIGHT NOW.

2791
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF EACH

2792
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
AND EVERY ONE OF OF THE CHILDREN

2793
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
AND ADULTS AND THE GRAND AWAY OF

2794
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
THE BULLETS AND THE FRAGMENTS

2795
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
AND THE BULLETS AND DISASTER AND
TRY TO COME UP WITH A FORENSIC

2796
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
STORY.

2797
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
>> WE WILL STAND BY WITH THE

2798
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
NEXT BRIEFING.

2799
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
STAND BY FOR THAT AS WELL.

2800
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
WE ARE GETTING MORE INFORMATION

2801
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
AND WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK

2802
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
AND RESUME OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE

2803
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
AFTER THIS.

2804
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Sometimes, I can't believe the
things I'm able to do.

2805
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Without Shriners Hospitals,

2806
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
my life would be completely
different.

2807
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
When I was seven,
we found out I had scoliosis.

2808
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Everything changed when
they stepped in.

2809
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
It was like they gave me
my future back.

2810
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Tori's life is one of nearly a
million changed

2811
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
by donations from people
like you.

2812
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Send your love to the rescue.

2813
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Donate today.

2814
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
>> >>> WE WILL CARRY THIS AROUND

2815
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
FOREVER.
THIS TOWN WILL NEVER BE THE

2816
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
SAME, I'M SURE.

2817
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
WHAT I FIND MYSELF TALKING TO

2818
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I

2819
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
AM COMPARING THIS WITH THE WORST

2820
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

2821
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
COLUMBINE AND THE VIRGINIA

2822
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
SHOOTING.
>> 26 PEOPLE GUNNED DOWN BY A

2823
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
SHOOTER.

2824
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
SIX ADULTS AND 20 CHILDREN AGE 5

2825
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
TO 10.

2826
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
IN THE SMALL TOWN IN

2827
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
CONNECTICUT.

2828
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2829
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
RARE IF EVER WE SEE THE

2830
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

2831
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
CRY DURING AN ADDRESS TO THE

2832
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
NATION, BUT WE DID SEE THAT

2833
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
TODAY WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE

2834
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
TO THE COUNTRY NOT JUST AS THE

2835
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
COMMANDER IN CHIEF, BUT ALSO AS

2836
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
A FATHER.

2837
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
>> I KNOW THERE IS NOTE A PARENT

2838
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

2839
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

2840
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
DO.

2841
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

2842
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

2843
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

2844
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

2845
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

2846
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

2847
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

2848
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

2849
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

2850
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
TEACHERS.
MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEIR

2851
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
LIVES TO HELPING OUR CHILDREN

2852
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.

2853
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

2854
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

2855
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

2856
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

2857
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

2858
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
>> THERE IS THE WHITE HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

2859
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE

2860
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
CONVERSATION THE PRESIDENT AND

2861
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
THE FIRST LADY ARE HAVING WITH

2862
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS RIGHT NOW

2863
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
LIKE MILLION OF OTHER PARENTS

2864
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
ARE HAVING WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

2865
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
YOU SAW THE FLAG HALF-STAFF AT

2866
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT ORDERED ALL FLAGS

2867
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
HALF-STAFF BETWEEN NOW AND

2868
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
DECEMBER 18th IN MEMORY OF THOSE

2869
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
KILLED TODAY IN NEWTOWN,

2870
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
CONNECTICUT AT SANDY HOOK

2871
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2872
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
LET'S BRING IN JESSICA YELLIN.

2873
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
YOU COVERED THIS AND HAVE YOU

2874
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
EVER SEEN THE PRESIDENT LIKE

2875
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
THIS BEFORE?
>> NO, WOLF.

2876
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PRESIDENT

2877
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
SO EMOTIONAL.

2878
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
HE WAS CRYING NOT JUST IN THAT

2879
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
CLIP, BUT THROUGHOUT HIS

2880
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
COMMENTS TODAY.
OPENLY WIPING AWAY TEARS THE

2881
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
WHOLE TIME AND SPEAKING IN

2882
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
INCREDIBLY PERSONAL AND

2883
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
EMOTIONAL TERMS.

2884
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
THE PRESIDENT UNFORTUNATELY HAS

2885
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
COME OUT AND ADDRESSED THE

2886
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
NATION REPEATEDLY AFTER MASS

2887
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
SHOOTINGS AND WOLF, USUALLY WHEN

2888
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
HE DOES, HE TRIES TO FIND A

2889
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
SILVER LINING AND TALKS ABOUT AN

2890
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
HEROIC ACT BY SOMEBODY WHO WAS

2891
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
WITH VICTIMS IN THE ROOM OR A

2892
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
MEDICAL MIRACLE THAT HAPPENED AT

2893
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
THE HOSPITAL.

2894
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
A STORY OF AMERICAN RESILIENCE.

2895
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
TODAY THE FACTS WERE TOO GRIM.

2896
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
INSTEAD OF PLAYING CONSOLER IN

2897
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
CHIEF, HE LED THE NATIONS IN

2898
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
GRIEVING AND EXPRESSING OUR OWN

2899
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
SADNESS AND IN MOURNING.

2900
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
YOU CAN SEE THE PRESIDENT ALMOST

2901
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
STRUGGLE FOR HIS OWN COMPOSURE

2902
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
AT ONE POINT.

2903
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
HE TALKED ABOUT HIS GIRLS ARE

2904
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN THESE KIDS,

2905
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
BUT YOU SEE HOW MUCH IT HIT HIM

2906
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND HOW HE

2907
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS SORT OF BEING

2908
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
A MOMENT FOR EVERYBODY TO PUT

2909
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
ASIDE WHATEVER DIFFERENCES WE

2910
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
HAVE AND FOCUS ON YOUR OWN LIVES

2911
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
AND WHAT YOU CAN BE GRATEFUL FOR

2912
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
AND HELP OTHERS.

2913
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT HE DID

2914
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
SAY WHILE THIS IS NOT A TIME TO

2915
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
TALK POLICY AND I WILL QUOTE, WE

2916
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMING TO

2917
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

2918
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

2919
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000

01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
BUT AS SOON AS IT APPEARS IT'S

3098
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
GOING TO BE A DISTURBED

3099
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
INDIVIDUAL, THEN PRETTY MUCH THE

3100
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
POLICE ARE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE

3101
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
OF THIS.

3102
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
ALSO, FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

3103
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
STANDPOINT, IT REALLY IS NOT

3104
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
CRITICAL AT THAT POINT WHOSE

3105
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
CASE IT WILL BE.

3106
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THERE'S GOING

3107
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
TO BE A PROSECUTION IF THE

3108
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
SHOOTER -- THE OFFENDER IS DEAD

3109
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
AND NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS OR

3110
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
CO-CONSPIRATORS ARE IDENTIFIED.

3111
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
IN THIS CASE, THE POLICE, THE

3112
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
FBI, THE ATF, ALL OTHER AGENCIES

3113
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
FROM THE AREA THAT WILL BE

3114
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
WORKING ON THIS WILL BE WORKING

3115
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER BUT IT

3116
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
WILL BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE

3117
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

3118
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
>> BECAUSE CONNECTICUT STATE

3119
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
POLICE SAYS THE SHOOTER IS DEAD,

3120
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
NO ONE SHOT AT THE SHOOTER.

3121
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
WE ASSUME THE SHOOTER WOUND UP

3122
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
KILLING HIMSELF AFTER KILLING

3123
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
ALL THESE KUNG KIDS AND KILLING

3124
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,000
THE ADULTS.

3125
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
BUT IF OTHERS MAY HAVE KNOWN

3126
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
ABOUT THESE PLANS, THERE COULD

3127
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
BE CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS OF

3128
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT

3129
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
IT.
>> THERE COULD BE.

3130
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
BUT OFTEN THERE'S NOT IN THESE

3131
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
CASES.
YOU MAY HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF

3132
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
THE FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR MAYBES

3133
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
WHO SAY, WELL, I KNEW HE WASN'T

3134
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
NORMAL, I KNEW HE HAD SOME

3135
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
PROBLEMS BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE

3136
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
WOULD GO THIS FAR, I DIDN'T KNOW

3137
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
HE HAD GUNS, DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS

3138
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
PLANNING THE EVENT.

3139
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
BUT THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE

3140
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE ALL

3141
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
ABOUT IN THE DAYS AHEAD IS

3142
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
OBTAINING HIS E-MAIL RECORDS AND

3143
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
PHONE RECORDS TO SEE WHO HAS HE

3144
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
BEEN IN CONTACT WITH AND WHAT

3145
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
DID HE TELL THEM?

3146
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
WHAT DO OTHERS THAT KNEW HIM --

3147
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT HIS

3148
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
THOUGHT PROCESS LEADING UP TO

3149
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
THE EVENT.

3150
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
>> YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN LAW

3151
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
ENFORCEMENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

3152
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
ANYTHING WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS

3153
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
AND MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO MAKE

3154
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

3155
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
>> NO.

3156
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
>> IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

3157
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
>> IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

3158
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
WE DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING OF THE

3159
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
BASICS.
WE HAVEN'T MADE THE IMPROVEMENTS

3160
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO

3161
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

3162
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
SEVERELY DISTURBED.

3163
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO

3164
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
PREVENT THE SEVERELY DISTURBED

3165
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
FROM OBTAINING THE WEAPONS THAT

3166
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
ARE SO PREVALENT IN OUR SOCIETY.

3167
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE DISTURBED

3168
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
PEOPLE ABLE TO OBTAIN WEAPONS

3169
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
AND ACT OUT WITH THOSE WEAPO

3170
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
WEAPONS --

3171
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
>> A LOT OF FOLKS WILL SAY THAT

3172
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE TOO

3173
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
AVAILABLE, TOO EASY TO GET.

3174
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
>> WHAT WE SAY NOW IS WE CAN'T

3175
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
TALK ABOUT IT.
EVERYBODY'S IN MOURNING.

3176
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
IT'S TOO SOON, IT'S NOT

3177
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
APPROPRIATE.

3178
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
SO LATER WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE,

3179
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
WE DON'T CARE.

3180
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
AND NOTHING CHANGES.

3181
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
AND I HAD A DAUGHTER AT VIRGINIA

3182
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
TECH DOWN THE HALL FROM THE

3183
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
FIRST SHOOTING, PEOPLE WERE

3184
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
KILLED IN A ROOM TEN ROOMS AWAY.

3185
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
WHAT'S CHANGED IN THE STATE OF

3186
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
VIRGINIA?
NOT ONE THING.

3187
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
>> YOUR DAUGHTER OKAY?
>> YES.

3188
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
>> THANK GOD FOR THAT.

3189
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
TOM, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING

3190
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
IN.
BRIAN TODD IS BRINGING US SOME

3191
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL REACTION

3192
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,000
COMING IN SO FAR TODAY.

3193
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
>> Reporter: THE ACCOUNT OF A

3194
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
YOUNG BOY SAID TO BE DELIVERING

3195
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
AN ATTENDANCE REPORT TO THE

3196
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,000
OFFICE AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

3197
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
SCHOOL WHEN THE SHOOTING TOOK

3198
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
PLACE IS SURREAL.

3199
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
>> I SAW THE BOARDS GOING PAST

3200
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
THE HALL THAT I WAS RIGHT NEXT

3201
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
TO.

3202
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
AND THEN A TEACHER PULLED ME

3203
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
INTO HER CLASSROOM.

3204
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
>> Reporter: HE SAID HE HEARD A

3205
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
SOUND LIKE SOMEONE KICKING A

3206
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
DOOR.
HIS MOTHER, CLINGING TO HIM, HAD

3207
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
WORDS OF THANKS.

3208
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
>> I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL TO THE

3209
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
TEACHER WHO SAVED HIM.

3210
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
>> YOU THINK THE TEACHER SAVED

3211
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
HIS LIFE.

3212
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
>> SHE DEFINITELY DID.

3213
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

3214
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
SHE GRABBED HIM AND ANOTHER

3215
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
CHILD AND PULLED THEM INTO A

3216
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
CLASSROOM.
>> Reporter: BRENDAN MURRAY, A

3217
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
FOURTH-GRADER, DESCRIBED THE

3218
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
CHAOS.
>> I WAS IN THE GYM AT THE TIME.

3219
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
SO THE TEACHERS -- WE HEAR LOTS

3220
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
OF BANGS.

3221
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE

3222
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
CUSTODIAN KNOCKING STUFF DOWN.

3223
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
WE HEARD SCREAMING.

3224
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
AND SO WE WENT TO THE WALL AND

3225
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
WE SAT DOWN AND THEN THE POLICE

3226
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
CAME IN.

3227
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
IT'S LIKE, IS HE IN HERE?

3228
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
THEN HE RAN OUT.

3229
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
AND OUR TEACHER -- SOMEBODY

3230
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,000
YELLED, GET TO A SAFE PLACE.

3231
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
SO WE WENT INTO THE CLOSET IN

3232
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
THE GYM AND WE SAT THERE FOR A

3233
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
LITTLE WHILE.

3234
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
THEN THE POLICE WERE KNOCKING ON

3235
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
THE DOOR AND THEY'RE LIKE, WE'RE

3236
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
EVACUATING PEOPLE.

3237
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
>> Reporter: CNN IS ONLY AIRING

3238
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
SOUND OF CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS

3239
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
GAVE PERMISSION.

3240
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
AS ONE WOMAN WALKED AWAY FROM

3241
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
THE SCHOOL, SHE WAS HEARD

3242
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
CRYING, WHY, WHY?

3243
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
A POLICEMAN WAS HEARD SAYING, IT

3244
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
WAS THE WORST THING HE'D SEEN IN
HIS CAREER.

3245
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
A NURSE FROM NEARBY DANBURY

3246
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
HOSPITAL DESCRIBED THE SCENE

3247
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
THERE AS PARENTS WAITED FOR WORD

3248
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN.

3249
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
>> THESE PARENTS WERE WAITING

3250
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO COME OUT.

3251
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

3252
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
STILL ALIVE.

3253
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

3254
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN
ARE DEAD.

3255
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

3256
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
>> Reporter: THE FATHER OF A

3257
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
YOUNG GIRL WHO SURVIVED WAS JUST

3258
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
TRYING TO PROCESS IT ALL.

3259
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.

3260
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
>> HERE HE IS, THE GOVERNOR OF

3261
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
CONNECTICUT, DAN MALLOY.

3262
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM IN THE

3263
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
ENSUING HOURS SINCE THIS

3264
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
UNSPEAKABLE AND TRAGIC EVENT

3265
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
OCCURRED HERE.

3266
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A NUMBER

3267
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
OF VICTIMS, TEACHERS, SUPPORT

3268
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
PERSONNEL IN THE BUILDING AND

3269
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
CHILDREN, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL

3270
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
CHILDREN WHO HAD SIMPLY COME TO

3271
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
SCHOOL TO LEARN AND THEIR DAY

3272
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
ENDED A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN

3273
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
ANY OF US COULD POSSIBLY HAVE

3274
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
IMAGINED.
AND QUITE FRANKLY AS WE STAND

3275
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
HERE TODAY, STILL CAN'T IMAGINE

3276
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED THERE.

3277
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

3278
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
TODAY.

3279
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
IT'S TOO EARLY TO SPEAK OF

3280
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
RECOVERY.
BUT EACH PARENT, EACH SIBLING,

3281
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
EACH MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAS TO

3282
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
UNDERSTAND THAT CONNECTICUT --

3283
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

3284
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO

3285
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
OVERCOME THIS EVENT.

3286
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH IT.

3287
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
BUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE TIME FOR

3288
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND FOR THESE

3289
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
FAMILIES.

3290
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
OUR POLICE PERSONNEL AND OTHERS

3291
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,000
ARE DOING THE UTMOST TO CLEAR

3292
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
THIS SITUATION AS SOON AS

3293
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
POSSIBLE AND TO RETURN THESE

3294
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS OR

3295
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
THESE LOVED ONES TO THEIR FELLOW

3296
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
LOVED ONES AS QUICKLY AS

3297
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
POSSIBLE.

3298
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
AND WE'LL WORK WITH ALL OF THE

3299
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
RESIDENTS OF THIS COMMUNITY AND

3300
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
CONNECTICUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

3301
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
DO, IN FACT, GET THROUGH THIS.

3302
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I WAS MAYOR OF STAMFORD ON 9/11

3303
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
WHEN OUR STATE LOST MANY OF ITS

3304
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
CITIZENS AND I LOST A NUMBER OF

3305
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
MY FELLOW CITIZENS AND FRIENDS.

3306
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IN A PUBLIC

3307
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
CAREER THAT I WOULD HAVE TO FACE

3308
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
THESE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR

3309
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
THAT THEY WOULD VISIT THEMSELVES

3310
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
UPON THIS COMMUNITY OR THE

3311
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT.

3312
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:59,000
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

3313
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
AND OUR PRAYERS AT THIS TIME

3314
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
HAVE TO GO OUT TO THE FAMILIES.

3315
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
AND SO AS I BEGAN BY THANKING

3316
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
THOSE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR

3317
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
DESIRES TO BE HELPFUL, THE

3318
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
NUMBER ONE WAY TO BE HELPFUL IS

3319
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,000
TO SAY A PRAYER OR SEND A BEST

3320
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
WISH OR TO BE THINKING OF THESE

3321
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO
MIGHTILY TODAY.

3322
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,000
THANK YOU.

3323
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
>> THAT'S THE GOVERNOR OF

3324
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
CONNECTICUT, DAN MALLOY.

3325
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE

3326
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
HEARING FROM LIEUTENANT PAUL

3327
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
VANCE AS WELL FROM THE

3328
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

3329
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
IF HE COMES TO THOSE

3330
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
MICROPHONES, OF COURSE, WE'RE
ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT HE SAYS.

3331
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S NOT SPEAKING

3332
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
OVER THERE.

3333
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

3334
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

3335
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
A HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC DAY IN

3336
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
CONNECTICUT AS WE'RE WATCHING

3337
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
THIS STORY UNFOLD.

3338
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,000
THE BREAKING NEWS CONTINUING TO

3339
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
EXPLODE NOT ONLY HERE IN THE

3340
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
UNITED STATES BUT AROUND THE

3341
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
WORLD.

3342
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
W
WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEWERS

3343
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

3344
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
THE STATE POLICE LIEUTENANT,

3345
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
PAUL VANCE, HE TELLS ME

3346
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
AUTHORITIES ARE INTERVIEWING

3347
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
EVERYONE WHO POSSIBLY HAD ANY

3348
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
CONNECTION TO THE SUSPECTED
GUNMAN.

3349
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
KATE BOLDUAN IS HERE HELPING US
WITH OUR COVERAGE AS WELL.

3350
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
THIS IS A STORY THAT CONTINUES

3351
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
TO RESONATE FOR PARENTS,

3352
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
GRANDPARENTS, LOVED ONES,

3353
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
EVERYONE, THOSE KIDS, AND A

3354
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS UNFOLDS,

3355
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
>> EVERYONE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY

3356
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE
AFFECTED BY THIS.

3357
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
THE GOVERNOR, I THINK, SAID IT

3358
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
WELL AND VERY SIMPLY PUT THAT

3359
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
EVIL HAS VISITED THAT TOWN

3360
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
TODAY.

3361
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AT

3362
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
LEAST ONE THING THAT WE CAN ALL

3363
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
BE SURE OF THAT HAS HAPPENED.

3364
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
THE INVESTIGATION IS UNFOLDING.

3365
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
THE GRIEVING, THOUGH, IS ONLY
BEGINNING.

3366
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
A CHURCH VIGIL, MANY ARE UNDER

3367
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
WAY AND DUE TO START SOON IN

3368
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
NEWTOWN WHERE THIS TRAGEDY HAS
UNFOLDED.

3369
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
LET'S BRING IN OUR JASON

3370
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
CARROLL, WHO IS ON THE GROUND

3371
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
THERE.

3372
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
JASON, ARE YOU AT THE SITE OF

3373
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
THE VIGIL?

3374
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT.

3375
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
THAT VIGIL SET TO TAKE PLACE

3376
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
JUST ABOUT 7:00 HERE AT ST. ROSE
LIMA CHURCH.

3377
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I SPOKE TO THE DEE CAN HERE

3378
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
EARLIER.
IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL DISCUSSION.

3379
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
HE TOLD ME THROUGHOUT THE DAY,

3380
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE HAVE COME

3381
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
THROUGH THE DOORS AT THE CHURCH

3382
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
HERE TRYING TO FIND PEACE,

3383
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS, TRYING TO

3384
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
FIND SOME SORT OF COMFORT.

3385
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
SO HE HAS BEEN DOING THAT

3386
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

3387
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
AND THIS IS PERSONAL TO HIM.
IT'S PERSONAL TO THIS COMMUNITY.

3388
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
HE TOLD ME THAT A NUMBER OF THE

3389
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
VICTIMS WENT TO CHURCH HERE.

3390
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
THIS IS WHERE THESE CHILDREN HAD

3391
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
THEIR FIRST COMMUNION.

3392
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
THIS IS WHERE THEY SAT IN THE

3393
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
PEWS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND

3394
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
LISTENED TO CERTAINLIENS.

3395
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
HE KNEW SOME OF THE VICTIMS AND

3396
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT JUST A

3397
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,000
LITTLE EARLIER.
TAKE A LISTEN.

3398
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
>> THIS IS A VERY TIGHT-KNIT

3399
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
COMMUNITY, IT'S A LARGE AND

3400
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
DYNAMIC PARISH.

3401
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY HERE.

3402
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT I'M

3403
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
SURE THAT QUITE A FEW OF THE

3404
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
KIDS THAT WE LOST TODAY ARE IN

3405
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:10,000
THIS PARISH.

3406
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
>> Reporter: AND I CAN ALSO TELL

3407
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
YOU THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE

3408
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
ARE ASKING IS THERE ARE LOTS OF

3409
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
QUESTIONS.

3410
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS, WHY?

3411
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
WHY DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPEN?

3412
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
AND HE SAID BECAUSE OF THE

3413
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
NEWNESS OF IT ALL, THERE'S NO

3414
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
WAY TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT WITH

3415
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
SOMETHING PROFOUND.

3416
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
BUT HE DID SAY THIS, HE SAID,

3417
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
QUOTE, THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS

3418
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
THAT ARE ONLY MEANT FOR GOD TO

3419
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
ANSWER.
AND HE SAID, THAT IS WHAT HE'S

3420
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
TELLING PEOPLE.

3421
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT MORE IN

3422
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
TERMS OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

3423
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
ABOUT THAT.

3424
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS --

3425
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT.

3426
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
BUT I HEARD THAT ONE OF THE

3427
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
VICTIMS -- RECENTLY SHE -- I

3428
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
THINK IT WAS BIRTHDAY MONEY.

3429
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
SHE GOT HER BIRTHDAY MONEY.

3430
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
SHE DONATED IT TO THE PARISH TO

3431
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
GIVE TO THE HURRICANE SANDY

3432
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
VICTIMS.

3433
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
6 YEARS OLD.

3434
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
SO THAT'S -- THAT MAKES IT VERY,

3435
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:14,000
VERY PERSONAL AND VERY INTIMATE.

3436
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
>> Reporter: AND THAT WAS WHEN
HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT A

3437
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
6-YEAR-OLD GIRL, ONE OF THE

3438
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
VICTIMS, HE SAYS, WHO WENT TO

3439
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
THIS CHURCH.

3440
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
HE USED TO LOOK AT THIS GIRL
EVERY SUNDAY.

3441
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PAINFUL

3442
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
IT IS FOR HIM, HOW PAINFUL IT IS

3443
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

3444
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
ONCE AGAIN, THE VIGIL IS

3445
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE HERE AT

3446
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
JUST ABOUT 7:00.

3447
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
WHEN I ASKED WHAT WILL BE

3448
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
HAPPENING, HE SAID, THIS IS

3449
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
UNLIKE ANY VIGIL OBVIOUSLY

3450
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
THEY'VE EVER HAD IN THE PAST.

3451
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
AND A LOT OF IT'S GOING TO BE

3452
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
OFF THE CUFF.

3453
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
THERE WILL BE A MASS.

3454
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
EXPECTED TO LAST FOR ABOUT AN

3455
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
HOUR.
HE SAID ALL WE CAN CONTINUE TO

3456
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
DO THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT,

3457
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
THROUGHOUT THE COMING DAYS AND

3458
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
THE M COOING WEEKS IS BE THERE

3459
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
AND TRY TO PROVIDE COMFORT TO

3460
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
THESE GRIEVING FAMILIES.

3461
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
>> JASON, IT SEEMS THE DEE CAN

3462
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
HIMSELF IS STRUGGLING FOR WORDS

3463
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
AND HOW TO COPE WITH THIS.

3464
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
HAS HE AT ALL BEEN CONTACTED BY

3465
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
ANY OF THE FAMILIES, ANYONE FROM

3466
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
THE SCHOOL?

3467
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
IT SEEMS IT IS A VERY SMALL

3468
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
COMMUNITY THERE.

3469
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
>> Reporter: HE HAS.

3470
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
HE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE

3471
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
FAMILIES.
SOME OF THE OTHER PRIESTS HERE

3472
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
HAVE BEEN DOWN AT THE FIREHOUSE

3473
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
CONSOLING THE FAMILIES
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

3474
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
AND HE HAS CHILDREN HIMSELF.

3475
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
SO THIS IS PERSONAL FOR HIM.

3476
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
THEY DID NOT GO TO THIS

3477
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT TO ANOTHER

3478
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
ONE.

3479
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
BUT HE KNEW THESE CHILDREN.

3480
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
HE KNEW THE FACULTY AT THE

3481
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
SCHOOL.

3482
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
THE FACULTY SAT IN THESE PEWS AS

3483
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
WELL.

3484
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
AND SO NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE TO

3485
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
PROVIDE COMFORT TO SOME OF THE

3486
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
VICTIMS, THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES,

3487
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
BUT HE ALSO HAS TO TRY AND FIND

3488
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
UNDERSTANDING HIMSELF BECAUSE IN

3489
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
HIS WORDS, HE'S GOT TO BE THEIR
ROCK.

3490
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
HE'S GOT TO BE THE PERSON HERE

3491
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
PROVIDING THE SUPPORT, WHICH IS

3492
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
DIFFICULT FOR HIM.

3493
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
HE SAID WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS

3494
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK, GO

3495
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
HOME, HUG HIS OWN DAUGHTER, GIVE

3496
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
THANKS AND COME BACK AND PROVIDE

3497
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
THE SUPPORT THAT IS SO BADLY

3498
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
NEEDED HERE.

3499
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
>> BEING THAT ROCK, MUCH EASIER

3500
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
SAID THAN DONE AT A TIME LIKE

3501
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
THIS WHEN SUCH UNSPEAKABLE

3502
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
TRAGEDY HAS HIT SUCH A SMALL

3503
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
COMMUNITY.

3504
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
JASON CARROLL LIVE OUTSIDE WHERE

3505
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
A VIGIL WILL BE STARTING IN JUST

3506
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW.

3507
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
JASON CARROLL, THANKS SO MUCH.

3508
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
>> WHAT A POWERFUL, POWERFUL

3509
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
REPORT.

3510
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
LET ME JUST REMIND OUR VIEWERS

3511
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

3512
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
FOR THOSE WHO MAY JUST BE TUNING

3513
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
IN, AROUND 9:30, 9:40 A.M. THIS

3514
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
MORNING, A MAN WENT INTO A SMALL

3515
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

3516
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
CONNECTICUT, AND BEGAN KILLING

3517
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
PEOPLE.
26 PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER.

3518
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
SIX ADULTS AND 20 CHILDREN.

3519
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
THIS IS A SMALL ELEMENTARY

3520
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
SCHOOL.

3521
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

3522
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
SCHOOL.

3523
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
FEWER THAN 600 CHILDREN IN THAT

3524
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
SCHOOL.

3525
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
ONLY GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH

3526
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
FOURTH GRADE INSIDE.

3527
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA THE MOTIVE, WHAT

3528
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
WAS BEHIND WHAT WAS GOING ON.

3529
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
26 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND THEN

3530
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
THE SHOOTER, WE BELIEVE, KILLED

3531
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
HIMSELF.

3532
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
SEPARATELY, THE MOTHER OF THE

3533
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
SHOOTER, WE BELIEVE, WAS KILLED

3534
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
SEPARATELY AT A HOME NOT FAR

3535
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
AWAY FROM THIS SCHOOL.

3536
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES

3537
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
COMING IN FROM NEWTOWN,

3538
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
CONNECTICUT, RIGHT NOW.

3539
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
THE POLICE ARE CONTINUING THEIR

3540
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
INVESTIGATION.
AND I SUSPECT THE CONNECTICUT

3541

STATE POLICE WILL BE BRIEFING US

3542
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000

3543
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
THESE ARE PICTURES COMING IN

3544
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
FROM THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

3545
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
SCHOOL.

3546
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS ON THE SCENE

3547
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
FOR US AS SHE'S BEEN NOW FOR

3548
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
SEVERAL HOURS.

3549
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
UPDATE OUR VIEWERS.

3550
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
WHAT'S THE LATEST, SUSAN?

3551
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
>> Reporter: THE LATEST IS THAT

3552
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO PIECE

3553
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
ALL OF THIS TOGETHER TO FIND OUT

3554
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
THE MOTIVE, MORE ABOUT THE

3555
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
SHOOTER, WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

3556
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
FOR A FEW HOURS NOW, POLICE TOOK

3557
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
INTO CUSTODY OR AT LEAST TOOK

3558
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
SOMEONE IN FOR QUESTIONING

3559
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IDENTIFIED TO

3560
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
US BY SOURCES AS A BROTHER OF

3561
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
THE DEAD SHOOTER HERE INVOLVED

3562
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
IN THIS SCHOOL INCIDENT, THE

3563
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
SXOOL SHOOTING.

3564
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
AND THEY'RE ASKING HIM QUESTIONS

3565
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
ABOUT HIS BROTHER.

3566
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
HE IS NOT BEING CALLED A SUSPECT

3567
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
AT THIS TIME.

3568
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
BUT THEY DO WANT TO TRY TO FIND
OUT AT THE VERY MINIMUM WHAT

3569
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
INFORMATION HE MAY HAVE ABOUT

3570
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
THE DEAD GUNMAN HERE AT THE

3571
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
SCHOOL.

3572
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
ALSO TRYING TO FIND OUT MORE

3573
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
ABOUT THE MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER

3574
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
WHO YOU KNOW HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED

3575
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
AS A SCHOOLTEACHER AND SHE WAS

3576
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
FOUND DEAD, WE ARE TOLD BY

3577
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
SOURCES, AT A RESIDENCE NEARBY

3578
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
THE SCHOOL HERE.

3579
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
SO ALL OF THESE PIECES AND PARTS

3580
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,000
OF THE PUZZLE BEING WORKED OUT

3581
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
AT THIS MOMENT BY INVESTIGATORS

3582
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
TO TRY AND FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT

3583
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
LED INTO THIS AND WHAT THE TIME

3584
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
LINE WAS AS WELL, WOLF.

3585
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
FOR EXAMPLE, WAS THE MOTHER SHOT

3586
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
BEFORE ALL OF THIS BEGAN?

3587
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
WE DON'T KNOW.
WOLF?

3588
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
>> WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF THE

3589
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
SHOOTER, THOUGH, SUSAN, WAS

3590
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
FOUND DEAD AT THE SCENE, NO ONE

3591
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
SHOT HIM, WE ASSUME THE SHOOTER

3592
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

3593
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
AND ALL THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN

3594
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
9:30 AND 10:00 A.M. OR SO,

3595
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES OR HALF

3596
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
AN HOUR.

3597
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
THE ASSUMPTION I HAVE IS THAT

3598
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
THE SHOOTER PRESUMABLY KILLED

3599
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
HIS MOTHER AT THE HOME BEFORE

3600
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
DRIVING OVER TO THE SCHOOL.

3601
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
>> Reporter: THAT SEEMS TO BE,

3602
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
OF COURSE, A FAIR ASSUMPTION

3603
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
HERE.
BUT NO ONE OFFICIALLY IS SAYING

3604
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
THAT.

3605
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
IN FACT, THEY HAVEN'T EVEN

3606
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
OFFICIALLY RELEASED THE NAME OF

3607
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
THE GUNMAN IN THIS CASE.

3608
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
WE DO KNOW FROM SOURCES THEY

3609
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
RECOVERED THE AT LEAST THREE

3610
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
WEAPONS FROM THE SCENE.

3611
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
TWO OF THEM HANDGUNS, INCLUDING

3612
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
A GLOCK AND A SIG SAUER.

3613
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
AND ANOTHER ONE, A SEMIAUTOMATIC

3614
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,000
WEAPON IDENTIFIED AS A .223

3615
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
BUSHMASTER.

3616
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BULLETS

3617
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
WERE FIRED.
A NUMBER OF WITNESSES SAY THERE

3618
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
WERE A LOT OF BULLETS THAT WERE

3619
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
HEARD.
WE ALSO DO NOT KNOW -- TRYING TO

3620
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
FIND OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW MUCH

3621
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
AMMUNITION THE SHOOTER CAME TO

3622
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
THE SCHOOL WITH AND DID HE HAVE

3623
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
ANY EXTRA MAGAZINES WITH HIM,

3624
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
GUN MAGAZINES, AMMO?

3625
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

3626
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO FIND OUT,

3627
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
WOLF.
>> WE'LL BE GETTING MORE

3628
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
INFORMATION IN THE HOURS TO
COME, SUSAN, THANKS VERY MUCH.

3629
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
TOM FOREMAN IS JOINING US NOW.

3630
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE LAYOUT

3631
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
OF THIS L SKOO.

3632
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING, TOM?

3633
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
>> SUSAN WAS RAISING A GOOD

3634
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
POINT AS YOU HAVE.

3635
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
PIECING ALL THIS TOGETHER IS

3636
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
GRIM AND DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT

3637
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
WORK BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

3638
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
MOVING PARTS TO THIS EQUATION.

3639
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATORS

3640
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

3641
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF

3642
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
COVERING MASSACRES AND SCHOOL

3643
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
SHOOTINGS, I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN

3644
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
MANY TIMES.

3645
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
THE EARLY HOURS, IT'S HARD TO

3646
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TIME LINE

3647
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
WAS, EXACTLY HOW THINGS

3648
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
UNFOLDED.

3649
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
WE'RE PIECING IT TOGETHER AS

3650
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
BEST WE CAN AS WELL.

3651
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
SO TAKE THIS TIME LINE AS BEING

3652
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
A BIT LOOSE BUT WE'LL WORK OUR

3653
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
WAY THROUGH IT.

3654
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
ABOUT 9:30 THIS MORNING IN THIS

3655
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
SCHOOL, CLASSES WERE UNDER WAY

3656
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
HERE.
THEY HAD A GOOD CROWD IN THERE,

3657
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
ABOUT 600 STUDENTS IN THE

3658
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
SCHOOL, 50 FACULTY MEMBERS.

3659
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
AND AT THAT TIME, A MEETING HAD

3660
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
JUST BROKEN OUT UP IN THE

3661
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL HERE.

3662
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
A SMALL MEETING WITH THE

3663
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
PRINCIPAL, VICE PRINCIPAL, THE

3664
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND A FEW

3665
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
ADULTS UP HERE IN A ROOM NEAR
THE OFFICE.

3666
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
SCHOOL STARTED AT 9:05.

3667
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
AT 9:30, HALF AN HOUR UNDER WAY,

3668
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
THEY'D BE GOING UP THERE.

3669
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
AT 9:40-ISH, BEST WE CAN TELL,

3670
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHOM

3671
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
YOU TALK TO, SOMEWHERE AROUND

3672
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
9:40 IS WHEN IT WOULD APPEAR

3673
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
THAT THIS GUNMAN ENTERS THE

3674
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
BUILDING.

3675
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
HOW?
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.

3676
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
POLICE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

3677
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
TODAY -- KEEP SEE PG PICTURES OF

3678
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
A BLACK CAR.

3679
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT CAR

3680
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
RIGHT HERE.

3681
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
IF THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE

3682
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
CRIME AS WE THINK AND BASED ON

3683
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
WHAT THE EYEWITNESSES HAVE SAID,

3684
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE GUNMAN

3685
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
CAME IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

3686
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
HERE.

3687
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
THIS LITTLE RED PART HERE IS A

3688
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:38,000
COVERED WALKWAY.

3689
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
HE WOULD HAVE COME IN HERE.

3690
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
AND EVERYTHING TRANSPIRED IN

3691
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
THIS AREA.

3692
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
AS SOON AS HE CAME IN, FROM ALL

3693
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
WE HEAR FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE

3694
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
THERE, PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THIS

3695
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
ENTIRE BUILDING STARTED HEARING

3696
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
SHOTS BEING FIRED.

3697
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
SOME OF THEM THOUGHT IT SOUNDED

3698
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
LIKE HAMMERING.

3699
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
SOME OF THEM HEARD LOUD BANGS.

3700
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
SOME OF THEM ALSO KNEW WHAT IT
WAS.

3701
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,000
BY 9:41, WE HAD CALLS GOING IN

3702
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
TO 911.

3703
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
THE PRINCIPAL, VICE PRINCIPAL

3704
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WERE

3705
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
IN THAT MEETING CAME OUT AND

3706
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
WENT TOWARD THE GUNFIRE,
ACCORDING TO A WITNESS.

3707
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
THEY HEADED TOWARD IT BUT ONLY

3708
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
THE VICE PRINCIPAL RETURNED AND

3709
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
THE VICE PRINCIPAL WAS WOUNDED

3710
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
IN THE LEG OR THE FOOT.

3711
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHICH.

3712
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,000
NONETHELESS, AT THIS POINT,

3713
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
EVERYTHING IS CLEARLY GETTING

3714
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
VERY TENSE BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW

3715
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
SOMETHING IS GOING ON THAT'S

3716
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
VERY BAD THERE.

3717
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
NOW, THE TIME LINE GETS EVEN

3718
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
LOOSER AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE

3719
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
DON'T KNOW HOW THE PROGRESS OF

3720
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
THE GUNFIRE WENT.

3721
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
WE KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

3722
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
IN THIS MEETING AND WITNESSES UP

3723
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
HERE SAID THEY HEARD A

3724
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF SHOTS.

3725
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
WE KNOW THEY HEARD YELLING AND

3726
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
SCREAMING.

3727
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
AUTHORITIES SAY THE ACTUAL

3728
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED OVER A

3729
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

3730
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
FOR ALL THE SHOTS THAT

3731
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
APPARENTLY WERE FIRED.

3732
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
AND THE GUNMAN DID NOT ROAM
AROUND.

3733
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
BUT, AGAIN, GENERALLY FROM ALL

3734
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
ACCOUNTS, STAYED RIGHT IN THIS

3735
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
AREA IN TWO ROOMS IN TERMS OF

3736
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
WHERE ALL THE SHOOTING HAPPENED.

3737
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
AND IN FACT, HE WAS FOUND IN ONE

3738
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
OF THOSE ROOMS.

3739
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
NOW, AT THE SAME TIME THAT ALL

3740
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
THIS IS HAPPENING -- AGAIN, BEAR

3741
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
IN MIND, THIS IS A VERY LOOSE

3742
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
TIME LINE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HERE.

3743
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
THE TEACHERS ARE TRYING TO

3744
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
PROTECT STUDENTS ALL OVER THIS

3745
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
SCHOOL.

3746
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
IN SOME CASES, THEY SEEM TO BE

3747
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
TRYING TO GET SOME OF THEM OUT.

3748
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
IN MANY OTHER CASES, THEY'RE

3749
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
TRYING TO HIDE THEM WITHIN THE
SCHOOL.

3750
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
THEY'RE LOCKING THE DOORS, GOING

3751
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
INTO LOCKDOWN AS PEOPLE

3752
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
DESCRIBED IT AND SAY THEY HAVE
TO STAY THERE AND BE SAFE.

3753
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
THAT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE

3754
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
SOME OF THE STUDENTS ARE TALKING

3755
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
ABOUT BEING EVACUATED AND IT'S

3756
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
NOT CLEAR IF A TEACHER TRIED TO

3757
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
LEAD THEM OUT OR AS, IN THIS

3758
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
CASE, LAW OFFICERS WERE LEADING

3759
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
THEM OUT WHICH HAPPENED A LITTLE

3760
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
BIT LATER.

3761
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THOUGH, AS

3762
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
THIS PROGRESSES, THE GUNFIRE

3763
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED.

3764
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
AT SOME POINT LAW OFFICERS

3765
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE FROM BOTH

3766
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
THE LOCAL POLICE AND THE STATE

3767
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
POLICE, LOCAL POLICE SAID FO THE

3768
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
STATE POLICE, WE KNOW WE HAVE A

3769
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
SERIOUS ISSUE HERE.

3770
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHEN IN THIS

3771
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
PROCESS THE GUNMAN DIES

3772
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
SOMEWHERE UP IN HERE.

3773
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,000
WE KNOW FROM LAWMEN THAT NONE OF

3774
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
THE OFFICERS FIRED A SHOT DURING

3775
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
THIS TIME.

3776
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
AS YOU SUGGESTED A MOMENT AGO,

3777
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
WOLF, THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT

3778
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
SOMEHOW HE SHOT HIMSELF AT THAT

3779
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
POINT.

3780
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WHEN THESE

3781
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
OFFICERS ARRIVE AT THE SCHOOL,

3782
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
THEY QUICKLY SEALED THE ENTIRE

3783
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
SCHOOL OFF AND THEY SPREAD INTO

3784
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
THE SCHOOL RAPIDLY, LOCKING DOWN

3785
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
EVERYTHING.
MAKING SURE THERE'S NO OTHER

3786
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
GUNMAN.
AND FRANKLY LOOKING FOR THOSE

3787
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE HIDING IN

3788
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
THERE.
AND I KNOW FROM PAST SCHOOL

3789
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
SHOOTINGS, THIS CAN BE A VERY,

3790
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
VERY DANGEROUS TIME SIMPLY

3791
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
BECAUSE THESE OFFICERS ARE

3792
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
POSSIBLY LOOKING FOR A GUNMAN

3793
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
BUT THEY'RE SUDDENLY WALKING

3794
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
PAST CLOSETS VERY OPENING AND

3795
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT AND THEY

3796
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
WALK PAST DOORBAYWAYS AND PEOPLE

3797
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
EMERGE BEHIND THEM.

3798
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS, TENSE

3799
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
TIME WHEN OFFICERS HAVE TO BE

3800
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
VERY PROFESSIONAL AND

3801
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
DISCIPLINED AND MAKE SURE

3802
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
SOMETHING AWFUL BEYOND THE

3803
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
HORRID EVENT THAT'S ALREADY

3804
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
HAPPENED DOES NOT OCCUR.

3805
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
BOTTOM LINE, THOSE OFFICERS WENT

3806
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
IN, THEY SECURED THE SCHOOL,

3807
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
THEY STARTED CLEARING THE KIDS
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

3808
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
AND WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE,

3809
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
THIS WHOLE EVENT PROBABLY TOOK

3810
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
20 TO 25 MINUTES, MAYBE 30,

3811
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
WOLF, FROM A NORMAL MORNING AT

3812
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
SCHOOL TO THIS TREMENDOUSLY

3813
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
AWFUL EVENT THAT WILL BE AROUND

3814
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
A LONG TIME.

02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
AND WITH
NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

3992
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
BOB CAN EAT THE HEALTHY FOODS
HE LIKES.

3993
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

3994
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

3995
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

3996
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

3997
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

3998
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

3999
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

4000
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

4001
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

4002
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

4003
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

4004
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

4005
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

4006
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

4007
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

4008
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

4009
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

4010
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

4011
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

4012
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
OR BLEEDING PROBLEMS.

4013
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
READY TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE?

4014
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

4015
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
FOR MORE INFORMATION
INCLUDING COST SUPPORT OPTIONS,

4016
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,000
CALL 1-888-XARELTO
OR VISIT GOXARELTO.COM.

4017
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
>>> WE JUST TOLD A LITTLE BOY
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW.

4018
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
HE SAID, I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY

4019
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
WITH NOW.

4020
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
EXCUSE ME.

4021
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
>> SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

4022
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
MOVED, UNDERSTANDABLY SO.

4023
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN COPE

4024
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
RIGHT NOW.

4025
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
>> WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS.

4026
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
YOU CAN JUST SEE THE SORROW ON

4027
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
EVERYONE'S FACE.

4028
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
YOU CAN SEE THE PAIN EVEN IN THE

4029
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
PRESIDENT'S WORDS TODAY.

4030
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
THIS IS JUST A MOMENT WHEN IT IS

4031
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
DIFFICULT TO WRAP YOUR MIND

4032
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
AROUND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

4033
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

4034
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
STATES HAS TO HOLD BACK TEARS

4035
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
AND STARTS CRYING SPEAKING TO

4036
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

4037
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
>> IT IS A NATIONAL TRAGEDY.

4038
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
>> I SPOKE JUST A LITTLE WHILE

4039
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
AGO WITH A MAN WHOSE 8-YEAR-OLD

4040
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
DAUGHTER ATTENDS THE SANDY HOOK

4041
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
ELEMENTARY ZOOL.

4042
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
TELL US WHERE YOU WERE AND WHAT

4043
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
WAS GOING ON, YOUR CONNECTION TO

4044
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
THE SCHOOL.
>> MY DAUGHTER'S A THIRD-GRADER.

4045
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
AND SHE WAS THERE ACTUALLY IN

4046
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
HER READING CLASS.

4047
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
THEY HEARD BANGS.

4048
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
AND THANK GOD FOR MRS. SUMMERS.

4049
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
HER READING TEACHER GRABBED MY

4050
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
DAUGHTER AND BROUGHT HER INTO A

4051
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

4052
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
ALONG WITH ANOTHER TEACHER.

4053
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
AND IN A SHORT TIME, SOME POLICE

4054
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
SOMEHOW WAS ABLE TO GET THEM OUT

4055
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,000
OF THERE AND ESCORT THEM THROUGH

4056
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
THE HALLWAY.
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A PRETTY

4057
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
MESSY SCENE FOR MY DAUGHTER.

4058
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
>> EARLIER IN THE DAY, I SPOKE

4059
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
WITH YOUR WIFE, LISA.

4060
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
SHE SAYS YOUR DAUGHTER SEEMS TO

4061
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
BE OKAY.

4062
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
YOU ALSO HAVE A 10-YEAR-OLD SON.

4063
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
HOW ARE THE KIDS DOING NOW IS?

4064
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF MY DAUGHTER

4065
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
IS IN SHOCK OR WHAT.

4066
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
SHE'S DOING INCREDIBLY WELL.

4067
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
MY SON IS DOING GREAT, TOO.

4068
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FEARS

4069
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
THAT THIS KIND OF THING --

4070
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
EVERYTHING -- THE GAME'S CHANGED

4071
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
FROM THIS POINT ONWARD.

4072
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHEN YOU

4073
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,000
SAY THE GAME HAS CHANGED --

4074
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
>> I MEAN, MY KIDS ARE ALREADY

4075
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
ASKING WHEN'S THIS GOING TO

4076
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
HAPPEN AGAIN?

4077
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
IT WAS ONLY A WEEK AGO THAT WE

4078
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF

4079
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
SITUATION AND I SAID, THE

4080
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
CHANCES OF IT HAPPENING ARE ONE

4081
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
IN A ZILLION AT SANDY HOOK.

4082
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
AND I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT.

4083
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
>> WE KNOW, DECLAN, YOU KNEW THE

4084
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
PRINCIPAL WELL.

4085
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
SHE WAS KILLED IN THIS MASS

4086
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
MURDER TODAY.

4087
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER.

4088
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
>> SHE JUST -- SHE WAS JUST SO

4089
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
NICE AND SHE LOVED HER JOB.

4090
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:32,000
AND SHE ACTUALLY ON A COUPLE OF

4091
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
OCCASIONS WENT OUT OF HER WAY

4092
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
JUST TO HELP US WITH CERTAIN

4093
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
THINGS THAT WE WERE WORKING ON

4094
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
WITH OUR DAUGHTER.

4095
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
THIS IS ALL SO SURREAL.

4096
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I'M A

4097
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
LITTLE CLOUDY RIGHT NOW.

4098
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
>> NO, BELIEVE ME, WE APPRECIATE

4099
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

4100
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT

4101
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

4102
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
JOHN KING IS WITH US AS WELL.

4103
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
HE'S GOT A QUESTION.

4104
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,000
>> SIR, SADLY IN ANY COMMUNITY

4105
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
WHEN TRAGEDY LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

4106
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
THERE ARE ALWAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT

4107
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
THE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.

4108
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
HOW DID YOU FIRST LEARN?

4109
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
HOW SPECIFIC WAS THAT

4110
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
INFORMATION AND OBVIOUSLY THE
OFFICIALS AT THE SCHOOL WERE

4111
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
DEALING WITH A TRAGEDY ON THE

4112
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
SCENE?
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT PART OF IT

4113
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,000
WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY?

4114
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
>> I THINK IT'S THE BEST THEY

4115
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
COULD DO.

4116
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU REALLY

4117
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
PREPARE FOR SOMETHING THIS
CRAZY.

4118
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
MY WIFE CALLED ME.

4119
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I WORK DOWN IN NEW YORK AND MY

4120
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
WIFE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME THERE

4121
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
HAD BEEN A SHOOTING AND SO I

4122
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
RUSHED HOME.

4123
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
MY WIFE WAS ALREADY IN TOWN AND
SHE RAN THERE.

4124
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
BUT SO FAR, THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL

4125
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
SYSTEM HAS BEEN GREAT IN LEAVING

4126
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
AUTOMATIC PHONE UPDATES WITH ALL

4127
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,000
THE PARENTS.

4128
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:37,000
>> SAD STORY.

4129
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
QUICK QUESTION BEFORE I LET YOU

4130
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
GO, DECLAN.

4131
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO

4132
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

4133
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
LETTING YOUR KIDS GO BACK TO THE

4134
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

4135
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

4136
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,000
>> WELL, I MEAN, THIS IS ALL SO

4137
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
NEW.

4138
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY KIDS AND

4139
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
EXPLAINING, LOOK, THIS IS WHAT

4140
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
HAPPEN

4141
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
HAPPENED.

4142
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:04,000
YOU DO YOUR BEST TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THEM AND YOU DO YOUR BEST

4143
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,000
TO -- IT'S FUNNY, A BOMB HIT,

4144
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AND IT'S

4145
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
STILL HERE.

4146
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,000
I HAVEN'T HAD MY -- ENOUGH TIME

4147
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
TO REALLY PLAN.

4148
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
BUT HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME THEY

4149
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
DO GO BACK TO SCHOOL, I'LL HAVE

4150
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF

4151
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
TALKING TO MY KIDS AND MAKING

4152
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
THEM FEEL AT LEAST THE MOST

4153
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
COMFORTABLE THEY COULD.

4154
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
>> HOW'S YOUR WIFE, LISA, DOING?

4155
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
>> WELL, SHE'S HANGING IN THERE.

4156
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
>> PLEASE GIVE ALL OF THEM OUR

4157
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
LOVE, OUR SYMPATHY, OUR SUPPORT.

4158
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,000
AND WE WISH THEM ONLY THE BEST,

4159
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
DECLAN.

4160
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
A PARENT OF TWO KIDS FROM THAT

4161
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

4162
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
WE'RE FOLLOWING THE BREAKING

4163
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,000
NEWS HERE IN "THE SITUATION

4164
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
ROOM."
ONE OF THE WORST SCHOOL

4165
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
SHOOTINGS IN AMERICAN HISTORY,

4166
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
EVEN MORE HORRIFIC BECAUSE THE

4167
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
CARNAGE WAS AT AN ELEMENTARY

4168
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
SCHOOL.
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

4169
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,000
POLICE SAY A GUNMAN KILLED 20

4170
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS AT THE

4171
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

4172
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
THE SMALL CONNECTICUT TOWN OF
NEWTOWN.

4173
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:10,000
THESE WERE YOUNG KIDS, INCLUDING

4174
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
KYNAINDERGARTENER

4175
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
KINDERGARTENERS.
TERRIFIED CHILDREN WERE LED OUT

4176
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
OF THE SCHOOL AFTER THE SHOOTING

4177
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
THIS MORNING HOLDING ONTO ONE

4178
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
ANOTHER.

4179
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,000
PARENTS RUSHED TO THE SCENE TO

4180
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
FIND OUT IF THEIR CHILDREN WERE

4181
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
DEAD OR ALIVE.

4182
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
>> THESE PARENTS WERE WAITING

4183
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO COME OUT.

4184
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

4185
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
STILL ALIVE.

4186
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

4187
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

4188
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
ARE DEAD.

4189
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:38,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

4190
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
>> POLICE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED

4191
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
THE GUNMAN BUT THEY SAY HE DID

4192
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
DIE AT THE SCENE, APPARENTLY

4193
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,000
KILLING HIMSELF.

4194
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
WE ARE TOLD THE MOTHER OF THE

4195
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER HAS BEEN FOUND

4196
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
DEAD AT HER SON'S HOME IN
NEWTOWN.

4197
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
AN EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT OBAMA

4198
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
WIPED AWAY TEARS AS HE OFFERED

4199
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,000
SUPPORT AND PRAYERS FOR THE

4200
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF THE
SCHOOL TRAGEDY.

4201
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH

4202
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

4203
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,000
MUELLER.

4204
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

4205
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:12,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

4206
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

4207
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT

4208
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:17,000
HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

4209
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

4210
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

4211
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

4212
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

4213
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS,

4214
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT

4215
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD, AS A

4216
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,000
PARENT.

4217
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

4218
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,000
TODAY.

4219
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

4220
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

4221
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:51,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I
DO.

4222
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

4223
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN, BEAUTIFUL

4224
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN THE AGES OF

4225
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,000
5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

4226
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

4227
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

4228
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:22,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

4229
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,000
THEIR OWN.

4230
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

4231
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

4232
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

4233
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

4234
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

4235
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
THOUSAND DOLLAR FOR THE PARENTS

4236
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
AND GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

4237
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

4238
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

4239
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

4240
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

4241
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS
WELL.

4242
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

4243
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

4244
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

4245
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

4246
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

4247
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

4248
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

4249
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES,

4250
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

4251
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

4252
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:19,000
MALL IN OREGON OR A TEMPLE IN

4253
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,000
WISCONSIN OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

4254
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

4255
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

4256
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE

4257
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

4258
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

4259
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

4260
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

4261
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

4262
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:40,000
POLITICS.

4263
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

4264
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

4265
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

4266
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER

4267
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

4268
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
THEM AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER

4269
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

4270
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

4271
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

4272
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
TONIGHT.

4273
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

4274
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
NOW IN THE HARD DAYS TO COME.

4275
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT

4276
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
OUR BEST AS AMERICANS AND I WILL

4277
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

4278
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

4279
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

4280
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

4281
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

4282
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,000
A HAND TO THOSE IN NEED TO

4283
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

4284
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

4285
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

4286
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES

4287
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
NOT JUST IN THEIR MEMORIES BUT

4288
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
ALSO IN OURS.

4289
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

4290
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:44,000
VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF SP

4291
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
RISHGSCZER, HEAL THE BROKEN

4292
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
HEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

4293
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
WOUNDS.

4294
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:56,000
>> YOU SEE A LIVE PICTURE OF THE

4295
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
WHITE HOUSE FLAG FLYING AT HALF

4296
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:02,000
STAFF.

4297
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:11,000
IT'S NOT OFTEN IF EVER YOU SEE A

4298
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
BREAK DOWN LIKE THAT.

4299
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

4300
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:17,000
HE'S KNOWN TO BE VERY STOIC EVEN

4301
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:20,000
GOING AS FAR AS SAYING HE CAN

4302
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
COME OFF AS STANDOFFISH.

4303
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
BUT NOT THE CASE TODAY.

4304
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
HE SAID, OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

4305
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
TODAY.
I THINK EVERYONE WATCHING HOW

4306
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
THIS IS UNFOLDED THROUGHOUT THE

4307
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
DAY -- ALL ASKING THE SAME

4308
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
QUESTION, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN,

4309
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

4310
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
AND EVERYONE'S SEARCHING FOR IF

4311
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
THERE ARE ANY KIND OF WORDS THAT

4312
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
COULD BE SAID TO TRY TO HELP

4313
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,000
THESE FAMILIES BEGIN TO HEAL.

4314
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
WE ALL KNOW THAT THOG CAN FILL

4315
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
THAT VOID RIGHT NOW.

4316
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
>> HE BREAK DOWN THE FIRST TIME

4317
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:49,000
WHEN HE SAID THESE KIDS WERE 5

4318
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
YEARS OLD TO 10 YEARS OLD AND HE

4319
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
SPOKE AS A PARENT.

4320
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
HE'S GOT TWO GIRLS HE SENDS TO

4321
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
SCHOOL EVERY DAY.

4322
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
YOU ASSUME THEY'RE SAFE AND

4323
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
SECURE AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME
HOME EVERY DAY.

4324
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,000
AND WHAT HAPPENS LIKE THIS?

4325
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN, BOOM, IT'S SUCH

4326
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:06,000
A SHOCK.

4327
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
DR. DREW PINSKY IS JOINING US

4328
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
FOR A LITTLE ANALYSIS.

4329
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
DR. DREW, YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT

4330
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
BREAKING DOWN.

4331
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,000
PEOPLE ARE BREAKING DOWN ALL

4332
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
OVER THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW JUST

4333
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT.

4334
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
>> WOLF, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

4335
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
RIGHT.

4336
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,000
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

4337
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
HE DID THERE WAS TO SHOW US,

4338
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
REFLECT FOR US FEELINGS THAT WE

4339
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
ARE ALL FEELING.

4340
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, EVERY

4341
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
FIVE MINUTES, I'M SORT OF TAKEN

4342
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:31,000
OVER BY A WAVE OF A DIFFERENT

4343
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,000
FEELING.

4344
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I'VE GONE FROM HEARTBREAK LIKE

4345
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
HE MENTIONED.

4346
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
THEN I GO TO ANGER AND RAGE AND

4347
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,000
DISGUST.

4348
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
TEN MINUTES AGO, I WAS FEELING

4349
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
NUMB AND FATIGUED AND DEPLETED.

4350
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
NOW I'M BACK TO DISGUSTED AGAIN.

4351
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I'VE COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY

4352
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
DISGUSTED THAT WE ARE HERE

4353
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

4354
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
YET AGAIN ANOTHER UNBELIEVABLY

4355
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
SENSELESS ACT.
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS.

4356
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

4357
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT

4358
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
DID SAY IS THAT WE NEED TO SAY

4359
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
OUR PRAYERS FOR THE FAMILIES

4360
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,000
THAT HAVE LOST SOMEONE IN

4361
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
CONNECTICUT WHICH CATEGORICALLY

4362
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,000
WE DO.

4363
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,000
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, EACH AND

4364
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
EVERY ONE OF US HAVE TO PAY

4365
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,000
ATTENTION TO OUR CHILDREN IN OUR

4366
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
FAMILIES TONIGHT BECAUSE EVERY

4367
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
FAMILY IN AMERICA IS AFFECTED BY

4368
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
THIS EVENT.

4369
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:16,000
THAT AMAZING INTERVIEW YOU

4370
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
PLAYED A FEW MOMENTS AGO FROM

4371
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
DECLAN, THE FATHER OF A YOUNG

4372
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
ONE AT THE SCHOOL, HIS CHILDREN

4373
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,000
WERE ASKING HIM, DADDY, WHEN IS

4374
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
THIS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

4375
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
THAT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN,

4376
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,000
WOLF, WHERE SOME PEOPLE ARE

4377
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,000
BEING PUSHED IN FRONT OF

4378
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,000
SUBWAYS.

4379
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,000
PEOPLE ARE NOT SAFE IN THE MALL.

4380
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
THEY'RE NOT SAFE IN THEIR

4381
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

4382
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN

4383
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
AGAIN?

4384
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US, OUR

4385
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
HOUSEHOLDS, OUR COMMUNITIES, TO

4386
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,000
MAKE SURE NOW IT NEVER HAPPENS

4387
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
AGAIN.

4388
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
>> DR. DREW, HOW DO YOU BEGIN --

4389
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO PARENTS

4390
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
AS THEY'RE WATCHING THIS?

4391
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
KIDS ARE VERY PERCEPTIVE AND CAN

4392
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000
PICK UP SIGNALS FROM THEIR

4393
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
PARENTS AND CAN SEE ALL THIS

4394
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
UNFOLDING ON THE TELEVISION IF
THEY'RE WATCHING IT.

4395
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

4396
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
>> WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO

4397
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
PARENTS AND HOW THEY BEGIN TO

4398
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
EXPLAIN THIS TO CHILDREN?

4399
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVEN

4400
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
US AS ADULTS TO TRY TO BEGIN TO

4401
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND SOMETHING

4402
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
LIKE THIS.

4403
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

4404
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THEM TO

4405
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
TRY TOP IDENTITY THEIR FEELINGS,

4406
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
TO REFLECT BACK TO THEM, THAT

4407
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,000
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE SCARED,

4408
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO BE

4409
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,000
CONFUSED, THAT THIS IS
SENSELESS.

4410
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
BUT IT'S REALLY OUR JOB TO LEAD

4411
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
OUR FAMILIES OUT OF THIS AND

4412
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
MAKE THEM FEEL SECURE.

4413
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,000
THINK ABOUT OUR FAMILY SYSTEMS

4414
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY.

4415
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
NOT EVERY CHILD FEELS SECURE AND

4416
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
SAFE IN THEIR FAMILY.

4417
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE BIG

4418
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,000
PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

4419
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
LITTLE PEOPLE SO THAT HORRIBLE

4420
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN
WHEN THEY GROW UP.

4421
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:39,000
SO REALLY IT'S DOUBLE DOWN, MAKE

4422
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
YOUR KIDS FEEL SAFE.

4423
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
ALLOW THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR

4424
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,000
FEELINGS BUT LET THEM KNOW THAT

4425
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
YOU WILL BE SURE THAT THEY GROW

4426
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
UP AND FLOURISH BECAUSE THAT IS

4427
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
YOUR JOB.
>> AND ONE QUICK FINAL QUESTION,

4428
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
DR. DREW, A LITTLE CHILD SEES

4429
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
MOMMY OR DADDY CRYING RIGHT NOW.

4430
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,000
THEY SAY, MOMMY, DADDY, WHY ARE

4431
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
YOU CRYING?

4432
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

4433
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,000
>> YOU SAY, IT'S GOOD.

4434
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I'M HAVING FEELINGS ABOUT THESE

4435
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,000
POOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOST

4436
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,000
SOMETHING.
I'M HAVING A FEELING.

4437
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,000
DON'T WORRY.

4438
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:10,000
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.

4439
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,000
CHILDREN WILL FEEL THAT

4440
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN HAIR

4441
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,000
LIFE IS BECAUSE OF THEM AND

4442
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN

4443
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
THE WORLD IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO

4444
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
THEM.

4445
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,000
SO THEY FEEL VULNERABLE BECAUSE

4446
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
OTHER KIDS HAVE BEEN HURT AND

4447
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL OUT OF

4448
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
CONTROL WHEN THEY SEE YOU BE

4449
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,000
EMOTIONAL.
BUT JUST EXPRESS IT.

4450
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DID A

4451
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
WONDERFUL JOB TODAY OF REALLY

4452
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
MODELING THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR

4453
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.

4454
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,000
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US

4455
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
TO HEAR FROM OUR LEADERS THAT

4456
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

4457
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT SAID

4458
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
CONNECTICUT WILL GET THROUGH.

4459
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
THOSE ARE MORE THE REASSURING

4460
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
WORDS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO HEAR

4461
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
SO WE CAN EACH INDIVIDUAL LEAD

4462
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
OUR COMMUNITIES, LEAD OUR
HOUSEHOLDS.

4463
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
>> DR. DREW PINSKY FROM OUR

4464
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
SISTER NETWORK, HLN.

4465
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
DR. DREW, THANKS VERY MUCH.

4466
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
POWERFUL, VERY IMPORTANT WORDS.

4467
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER QUICK BREAK,

4468
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,000
RESUME OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF

4469
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000
THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY IN

4470
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
CONNECTICUT RIGHT AFTER THIS.

4471
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Capella University understands
businesses are trying to come

4472
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:13,000
back from rough economic times.

4473
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Employees are being forced to do
more with less.

4474
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
And the need for capable leaders
is greater than ever.

4475
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
When you see these problems do
you take a step back,

4476
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
or do you want to dive right in?

4477
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:29,000
With a degree in business from
Capella University, you'll have

4478
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:33,000
the knowledge to go further in
your career than you ever
thought possible.

4479
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Let's get started at CAPELLA.EDU

4480
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
>>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS ON THE

4481
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
SCENE FOR US IN NEWTOWN,

4482
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
CONNECTICUT.

4483
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
SUSAN, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

4484
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
GETTING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT

4485
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
THE SHOOTER.

4486
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

4487
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
AND CONTRARY TO CONFLICTING

4488
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:13,000
INFORMATION THAT INVESTIGATORS

4489
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
THEMSELVES HAD EARLIER AND HAD

4490
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
PASSED ON, WE CAN NOW TELL YOU

4491
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES

4492
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:22,000
THAT THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER IN

4493
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
THIS CASE IS ADAM LANZA.

4494
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
HE IS 20 YEARS OLD AND HIS

4495
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
BROTHER'S NAME IS RYAN LANZA.

4496
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
IT IS ADAM LANZA, 20 YEARS OLD,

4497
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
WHO IS THE SHOOTER.

4498
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
HIS BROTHER, RYAN, IS THE ONE

4499
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FOR

4500
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
QUESTIONING BY AUTHORITIES IN

4501
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, AND IS

4502
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
EXPECTED THAT HE WILL BE

4503
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
RELEASED.

4504
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED A SUSPECT.

4505
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE WILL BE

4506
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
RELEASED.

4507
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
WE ALSO HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL

4508
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
INFORMATION THAT THE FATHER OF

4509
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:58,000
THE SHOOTER.

4510
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:04,000
THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE

4511
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:05,000
BROTH
FATHER IS A SUSPECT IN THIS

4512
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,000
CASE.
HE IS DIVORCED FROM NANCY LANZA,

4513
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
IDENTIFIED AS A VICTIM IN THIS

4514
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
CASE.

4515
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
HE REMARRIED AND LIVES IN THE

4516
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
SAME AREA WHERE THIS SHOOTING

4517
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
OCCURRED.

4518
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,000
SO THAT IS THE NEW INFORMATION

4519
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
THAT WE HAVE ABOUT NOW.

4520
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
WE HAVE THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER

4521
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
AS ADAM LANZA, 20 YEARS OLD.

4522
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
HIS OLDER BROTHER, RYAN, 24

4523
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
YEARS OLD, IS THE ONE WHO WAS

4524
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,000
QUESTIONED IN HOBOKEN, NEW

4525
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
JERSEY.

4526
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
HE IS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED.

4527
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN.

4528
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
THE FATHER OF BOTH OF THEM ALSO

4529
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
QUESTIONED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT
THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE, HIS

4530
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
SON.

4531
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT

4532
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
THE FATHER IS CONSIDERED A

4533
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
SUSPECT IN ANY WAY.

4534
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
WOLF?
>> JUST TO RECAP, THE VIDEO THAT

4535
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
WE SAW OF SOMEBODY BEING TAKEN

4536
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
AWAY, THIS IS RYAN LANZA, THERE

4537
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
IT IS, COURTESY OF OUR AFFILIATE

4538
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
WCBS IN NEW YORK.

4539
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
THAT IS LINE LANZA.

4540
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
I BELIEVE HE'S 24 YEARS OLD.

4541
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
HE'S THE OLDER BROTHER OF THE

4542
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
MAN NOW SUSPECTED OF BEING THE

4543
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA WHO'S 20

4544
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,000
YEARS OLD.

4545
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
THERE YOU SEE THE POLICE OFFICER

4546
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
TAKING RYAN LANZA AWAY.

4547
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
THEIR MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WAS

4548
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:15,000
FOUND DEAD IN THE HOUSE IN

4549
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
NEWTOWN.
THAT'S RIGHT, SUSAN?

4550
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

4551
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
THAT IS CORRECT.

4552
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:24,000
SHE WAS FOUND DEAD AT THAT
RESIDENCE HERE IN NEWTOWN.

4553
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
AND WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR ALL

4554
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,000
OF THESE NAMES TO BE OFFICIALLY

4555
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,000
RELEASED BY AUTHORITIES.

4556
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO YET.

4557
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

4558
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
THIS THROUGH SEVERAL LAW

4559
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES.

4560
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,000
>> AND THE PARENTS ARE DIVORCED

4561
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,000
AND SO THE FATHER LIVES

4562
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
ELSEWHERE.
AND THERE'S NO INDICATION HE HAD

4563
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING ALONG

4564
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:44,000
THESE LINES, IS THAT RIGHT?

4565
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
>> Reporter: THERE'S NO
INDICATION OF THAT AT ALL, NO

4566
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
INDICATION OF THAT AT ALL, WOLF.

4567
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
>> SUSAN, THANKS FOR CLARIFYING
THAT.

4568
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
I SUSPECT THOSE MICROPHONES

4569
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,000
BEHIND YOU WILL BE USED FAIRLY

4570
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,000
SOON, THE CONNECTICUT STATE

4571
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
POLICE, LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, I

4572
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000

4575
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,000
BUT THERE YOU HAVE IT, KATE.

4576
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,000
THE LATEST INFORMATION FROM

4577
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

4578
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
>> DOING GREAT REPORTING FOR US.

4579
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
LET'S GO TO PRODUCER ADAM REESE.

4580
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
HE'S ON THE GROUND IN HOBOKEN,

4581
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
NEW JERS.

4582
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
HE'S ON THE PHONE WITH US.

4583
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
ADAM, WE WERE JUST SEEING VIDEO

4584
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000

4585
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER'S BROTHER.

4586
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AGAIN HERE.

4587
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,000
THIS IS THE BROTHER OF THE

4588
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER, THIS MAN'S

4589
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,000
NAME THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS

4590
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
VIDEO IS RYAN LANZA, WE ARE

4591
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
TOLD.
AND THE SHOOTER, AS SUSAN

4592
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
CANDIOTTI, IS LEARNING FROM
SOURCES, IS ADAM LANZA.

4593
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
WHAT MORE ARE YOU LEARNING ON

4594
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,000
THE GROUND IN HOBOKEN THIS

4595
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
EVENING?

4596
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
>> Reporter: WELL, THE POLICE

4597
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,000
HERE HAVE JUST OPENED UP THE

4598
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,000
STREETS OUTSIDE HIS APARTMENT,

4599
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,000
1313 GRAND, THE NAME OF THE

4600
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
BUILDING IS CALLED THE

4601
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
METROPOLITAN.

4602
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,000
THE POLICE HAVE JUST DROPPED THE

4603
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
POLICE TAPE, OPENED UP THE
STREETS THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL

4604
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
OFFICES AND AN FBI AGENT IN

4605
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
FRONT OF THE BUILDING MAKING

4606
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
SURE ONLY RESIDENTS GO INTO THE

4607
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
BUILDING.
AS YOU JUST REPORTED, THE

4608
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
SHOOTER'S BROTHER, RYAN LANZA

4609
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,000
WAS TAKEN FROM THIS APARTMENT

4610
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
BUILDING EARLIER TODAY IN

4611
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
HANDCUFFS.
HE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT DAZED

4612
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,000
BASED ON THE VIDEO WE SAW.

4613
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:13,000
THE BUILDING IS A FIVE-STORY

4614
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
BUILDING, ONE, TWO AND
THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENTS.

4615
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
IT'S A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

4616
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
HOBOKEN IS A GROWING COMMUNITY

4617
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
OF PROFESSIONALS.

4618
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
IT'S RIGHT ON THE WATER FACING

4619
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
MANHATTAN.

4620
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
IN ADDITION TO RYAN LANZA, TWO

4621
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
ROOMMATES WERE TAKEN INTO

4622
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
CUSTODY.
THEY WERE TAKEN IN FOR

4623
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
QUESTIONING BUT THEY ARE NOT

4624
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
BELIEVED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH

4625
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
THE SHOOTING, AT LEAST ACCORDING

4626
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,000
TO THE POLICE CHIEF WHO BRIEFED

4627
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
THE MEDIA HERE EARLIER TODAY.

4628
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,000
SO THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF

4629
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,000
MEDIA.

4630
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:46,000
BUT I CAN SAY THIS SCENE HERE

4631
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,000
HAS DIED DOWN QUITE A BIT.

4632
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,000
>> ADAM, YOU SAID THE

4633
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
AUTHORITIES SEEM TO BE OPENING

4634
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
UP THE STREET NEAR THIS
APARTMENT BUILDING WHERE RYAN

4635
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
LANZA LIVES.

4636
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
WE MUST TAKE THAT AS AN

4637
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
INDICATION THAT THEY DON'T THINK

4638
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
THERE'S ANY MORE INVESTIGATION

4639
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,000
THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR THERE WHICH

4640
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
WORKS WITH THE REPORTING FROM

4641
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI THAT HER SOURCES

4642
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
SAY THAT SHE BELIEVES THAT RYAN

4643
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
LANZA WILL BE RELEASED FROM

4644
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,000
POLICE CUSTODY AT SOME POINT,

4645
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHEN.

4646
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S MY

4647
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
UNDERSTANDING AS WELL.

4648
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
THAT HE WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME

4649
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
POINT, THAT HE IS BEING

4650
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
QUESTIONED AND APPARENTLY WE ARE

4651
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
TOLD HE IS BEING COOPERATIVE.

4652
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
AND WE ARE WAITING FOR HIS

4653
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
RETURN HERE AT THE APARTMENT

4654
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:32,000
BUILDING.

4655
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
>> ADAM, MANY THREADS TO FOLLOW

4656
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
IN THIS STILL-DEVELOPING STORY

4657
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
AND THIS TRAGEDY AS WE'RE

4658
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
WATCHING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

4659
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
>> JOE JOHNS IS HERE, OUR CRIME

4660
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT.

4661
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,000
YOU'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION
ON THE WEAPON OR WEAPONS THAT

4662
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
WERE USED TODAY?
>> RIGHT.

4663
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE
DIFFERENT GUNS HERE, A GLOCK, A

4664
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:53,000
SIG SAUER AND A BUSHMASTER .223.

4665
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:54,000
THAT WAS THE KIND OF WEAPON THAT

4666
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,000
WAS USED IN THE BELTWAY SNIPER

4667
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
SHOOTINGS YEARS AND YEARS AGO.

4668
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,000
AN ASSAULT WEAPON.

4669
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
IT TURNS OUT, ACCORDING TO LAW

4670
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES, WHO HAVE

4671
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,000
TALKED TO OUR CAROL KRADDY, THAT

4672
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
ALL THREE OF THESE WEAPONS WERE

4673
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:13,000
REGISTERED TO THE MOTHER OF THE

4674
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
SHOOTER.
>> NANCY LANZA.
>> NANCY LANZA.

4675
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:16,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

4676
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT THAT.

4677
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THE BUREAU OF

4678
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,000
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS

4679
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
DOES LOTS AND LOTS OF TRACING OF

4680
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
THESE WEAPONS WHENEVER YOU HAVE

4681
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

4682
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING

4683
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
TO GO THROUGH ALL THEIR TRAPS.

4684
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS, THESE

4685
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:34,000
WEAPONS WERE APPARENTLY

4686
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
PURCHASED LEGALLY BY NANCY

4687
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,000
LANZA, NOT BY THE SHOOTER, ADAM.

4688
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
AND THAT APPARENTLY IS THE END

4689
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

4690
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
>> ADAM LANZA IS DEAD,

4691
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,000
APPARENTLY TOOK HIS OWN LIFE,

4692
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER.

4693
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
NANCY LANZA IS DEAD, SHE WAS

4694
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
KILLED AT PRESUMABLY AT THE

4695
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,000
HOUSE IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

4696
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
THIS INFORMATION, CAROL, I'M

4697
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
GETTING INFORMATION FROM HER AS

4698
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
WELL, THESE ARE RECORDS THAT

4699
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
COME IN FROM THE CONNECTICUT

4700
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
FIREARMS REGISTRATION SYSTEM

4701
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
WHICH IS A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED

4702
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:06,000
GUN CONTROL OPERATION IN

4703
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> YEAH, IT'S A COMPLICATED

4704
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:10,000
TRACE THAT THE ATF HAS TO GO

4705
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
THROUGH.
THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

4706
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
MANUFACTURER, THEN THEY HAVE TO

4707
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,000
GO TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR,

4708
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

4709
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
FIRST PURCHASER.
AND IF THERE'S ANOTHER

4710
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
PURCHASER, THEN THEY HAVE TO
FOLLOW THE CHAIN ALL THE WAY

4711
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
THROUGH.
THAT'S THE WAY THE LAW WORKS.

4712
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,000
BUT A LOT OF TIMES IN THESE BIG

4713
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
CASES, THEY'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT

4714
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
THE SITUATION, FIND OUT WHO

4715
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
OWNED THE GUNS, WHO PURCHASED

4716
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
THE GUNS, VERY QUICKLY.

4717
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
APPARENTLY THE AUTHORITIES HAVE

4718
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:33,000
BEEN ABLE TO RUN THOSE TRAPS.

4719

4720
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
THE GLOCK AND THE SIG SAUER

4721
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,000
HANDGUNS WERE FOUND INSIDE THE

4722

SCHOOL.
>> RIGHT.

4723
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
AND THE BUSHMASTER OUTSIDE.

4724
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
>> FOUND IN THE CAR.
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS NOT USED.

4725
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

4726
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
>> AT LEAST NOT IN KILLING THESE

4727
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
KIDS, THE TEACHERS, THE

4728
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
PRINCIPAL.

4729
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE QUESTION IS, AT LEAST ONE OF

4730
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
THE MANY QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN

4731
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
ASKING THE AUTHORITIES AND

4732
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO YET,

4733
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
IS WHETHER THE MAGAZINES ON

4734
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:01,000
THOSE WEAPONS WERE -- THE LARGE,

4735
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:02,000
EXTENDED MAGAZINES OR WHETHER

4736
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
THEY WERE THE MAGAZINES THAT

4737
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,000
TYPICALLY COME WITH THE

4738
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,000
FIREARMS.
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.

4739
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL PART OF THE

4740
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
GUN CONTROL DEBATE, WHETHER

4741
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
THOSE MAGAZINES ARE APPROPRIATE

4742
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,000
FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE JUST ON THE

4743
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:14,000
STREETS.
>> WE SAW THE PICTURES OF THOSE

4744
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
GUNS.

4745
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY KILLED A LOT OF

4746
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
PEOPLE.
>> NOW I THINK -- LET'S TAKE YOU

4747
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,000

02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
YOU KNOW, HUMAN MINDS ARE NOT

4883
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
INFINITE.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOW APPEARING

4884
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:34,000
TO BE PROBABLY THE WORST

4885
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:35,000
SCHOOLYARD CATASTROPHE IN

4886
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
HISTORY.
THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE,

4887
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:38,000
LONG-TERM FALLOUT FOR THIS THAT

4888
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:41,000
IS ALSO GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S

4889
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:42,000
EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.

4890
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
AND WE NEED TO GEAR OURSELVES UP

4891
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
FOR THAT FALLOUT BECAUSE IT'S

4892
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:47,000
COMING BECAUSE THIS IS A
HORRIBLE THING.

4893
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
>> Reporter: THE NEWS OUT OF

4894
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
NEWTOWN IS TRAUMATIC FOR PARENTS

4895
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:52,000
AND CHILDREN.
THIS HAPPENED AT A SCHOOL WHERE

4896
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,000
KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAFE.

4897
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
>> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THE

4898
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
CHILDREN?
AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF

4899
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
THE CHILD, BUT I THINK SIMPLE,

4900
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
FORTHRIGHT EXPLANATIONS ARE THE

4901
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:02,000
BEST.

4902
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

4903
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
THAT I TELL CHILDREN IS, THERE

4904
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
ARE SOME BAD PEOPLE IN THE

4905
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
WORLD.

4906
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
AND SOMETIMES BAD PEOPLE DO

4907
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:11,000
REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS.

4908
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
AND A TERRIBLE THING HAS

4909
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
HAPPENED AND THERE HAVE BEEN

4910
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,000
SOME CHILDREN KILLED.

4911
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:16,000
AND THIS IS TERRIBLE.

4912
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:20,000
BUT YOU'RE SAFE.

4913
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:23,000
AND, YOU KNOW -- YOU'RE SAFE,

4914
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,000
AND YOU'RE IN A SITUATION NOW

4915
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE

4916
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
HARMED.

ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OFFERS

4918
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,000
THIS ADVICE.

4919
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AGE OF THE

4920
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
CHILD AND PROVIDE BASIC

4921
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
INFORMATION WITHOUT OFFERING

4922
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
DETAILS THAT MAY ONLY ALARM

4923
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:37,000
THEM.
ASK YOUR CHILDREN WHAT THEY

4924
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
ALREADY KNOW AND ANSWER

4925
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
QUESTIONS.
PARENTS CAN SHARE THEIR OWN

4926
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
FEELINGS IN THE WAYS THEY'RE

COPING AND FIND MEANINGFUL WAYS

4928
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,000
TO HELP OTHERS.

4929
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
>> CHILDREN ARE RESILIENT AND

4930
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW IS HOW

4931
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:51,000
WE HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

4932
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
HAPPENED BUT EVEN I THINK MORE

4933
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
IMPORTANT IS THE SENSE OF

4934
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
PROTECTION AND SAFETY THAT WE

4935
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
