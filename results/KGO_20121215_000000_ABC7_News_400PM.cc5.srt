YOUR KIDS TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED?

INSIDE OF YOURSELF, KIDS MODEL

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
HOW PARENTS ARE REACTING.

IF YOU FEEL ANXIOUS, SCARED,

861
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
THE FIRST STEP IS TO CALM
YOURSELF, WORK THROUGH WHAT

862
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
YOU CAN BEFORE TALKING TO

863
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THEM.
SECOND STEP IS TO BEGIN TO

864
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
LISTEN TO THEM.

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO WHAT IS

872
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
GOING ON FOR THEM.

873
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
AND LAST THING, EXPLAIN WHAT

874
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
IS GOING ON TO THEM IN A WAY

875
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000

AND EXPECT A DELAYED REACTION,

883
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
