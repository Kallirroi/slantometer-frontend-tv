THE WALL.

192
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HE WAS DOING LIKE THAT AND I

193
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WAS STANDING AGAINST THE

194
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
DOOR.
>> Reporter: HOW

195
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
FRIGHTENING.

196
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THOSE INSIDE THE THEATER

197
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
WERE SCARED THAT AN

198
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AURORA-STYLE SHOOTING WAS

199
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TAKES PLACE RIGHT THERE.

200
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
LUCKILY THERE WAS OFF-DUTY

201
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SHERIFF'S DEPUTY WORKING

202
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SECURITY AT THE THEATER THAT

203
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
NIGHT.
SHE HEARD THE SHOTS AND TOOK

204
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
DOWN THE SUSPECT STOPPING

205
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HIS MANHUNT.

206
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
>> WE WERE FORTUNATE WE HAVE

207
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THE OFFICER WAS WELL-TRAINED

208
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
AND TOOK THE ACTION SHE

209
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
NEEDED TO TAKE.

210
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I BELIEVE SHE SAVED AS MANY

211
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
LIVES AS SHE HAD TO SAVE.

212
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> Reporter: THE SUSPECT

213
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SHOT AT ONE MAN AND FIRED AT

214
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A POLICE DEPARTMENT PATROL

215
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
CAR IN THE PARKING LOT.

216
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

217
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ROUNDS HE GOT OFF BEFORE THE

218
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
DEPUTIES STOPPED HIM.

219
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE IN

220
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THE RESTAURANT, THE PARKING

221
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
LOT AND THEATER WERE

222
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.

223
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
JENNA.

224
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
JENNA: MORE ON THAT STORY AS

225
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WE GET IT, HEATHER.

226
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THANK YOU.

227
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
JON: TURNING ATTENTION TO

228
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WASHINGTON.

229
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
NEW INFORMATION BREAKING IN

230
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THE LAST HOUR THAT A BACKUP

231
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
PLAN IS IN THE WORKS FOR

232
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
REPUBLICANS IN CASE THE

233
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS CAN

234
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
NOT REACH A DEAL ON THE

235
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
FISCAL CLIFF BY THE END OF

236
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THE YEAR.

237
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER

238
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SPOKE ABOUT IT A MINUTES

239
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
AGO.
>> OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

240
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE

241
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS

242
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
AND HAVE ALL OF THEIR

243
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
CURRENT RATES EXTENDED.

244
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I CONTINUE TO HAVE HOPE THAT

245
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WE CAN REACH A BROADER

246
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AGREEMENT WITH THE

247
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WHITE HOUSE THAT WOULD

248
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
REDUCE SPENDING AS WELL AS

249
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HAVE REVENUES ON THE TABLE.

250
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
JON: DESPITE THE EXISTENCE

251
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
OF THIS PLAN B NEGOTIATIONS

252
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ARE MOVING FORWARD BETWEEN

253
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SPEAKER

254
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
BOEHNER TO TRY TO AVOID THE

255
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

256
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ED HENRY IS LIVE AT THE

257
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WHITE HOUSE.
SO TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE

258
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ABOUT PLAN B.
WHAT IS IT, ED?

259
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> Reporter: GOOD TO

260
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
JON.
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S

261
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
POSITION ALL ALONG YOU ONLY

262
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE MAKING

263
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OVER $250,000.

264
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
REPUBLICANS SAID LOOK, THAT

265
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WILL END UP NOT JUST HITTING

266
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
INDIVIDUALS BUT A LOT OF

267
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SMALL BUSINESSES.

268
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IT WILL RESULT IN THEM NOT

269
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
CREATING JOBS, ET CETERA.

270
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SO YOU HEAR THE SPEAKER

271
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SAYING LOOK, LET'S HAVE A

272
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HOUSE VOTE NEXT COUPLE DAYS

273
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT WOULD PUT THE CAP AT

274
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BASICALLY A MILLION DOLLARS

275
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OR MORE.

276
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THEN YOUR TAXES GO UP.

277
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BUT PROTECT PEOPLE UNDER

278
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THAT MILLION DOLLAR RANGE.

279
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THAT WOULD, IF IT WERE TO

280
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
PASS, WOULD EXTEND THE BUSH

281
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
TAX RATES ESSENTIALLY FOR

282
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ANYBODY MAKING UNDER A

283
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS.

284
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THEN YOU MOVE FORWARD, GET

285
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR.

286
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YOU SAVE SOME SPENDING

287
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
ISSUES AND WHAT NOT UNTIL

288
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
NEXT YEAR BUT YOU SORT OF

289
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
AVOID THE FISCAL CLIFF IN

290
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THE SHORT TERM AND ERIC

291
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
CANTOR, THE HOUSE MA

292
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AUTHORITY -- MAJORITY LEADER

293
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
SAID THIS MAY BE THE ONLY

294
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OPTION BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

295
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
IS NOT PUTTING ENOUGH

296
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SPENDING CUTS ON THE TABLE.

297
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

298
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT YET

299
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
THERE.
HE HAS NOT COME TO WHERE HE

300
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO FOR

301
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
US TO PUSH THROUGH A BILL

302
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THAT REALLY DOES BEGIN TO

303
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND AS

304
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THE SPEAKER SAID THAT'S WHY

305
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WE'RE DISCUSSING AN

306
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ALTERNATIVE PLAN AND IF THE

307
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
PRESIDENT AND THE

308
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WHITE HOUSE CAN NOT COME OUR

309
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WAY.
>> Reporter: BREAKING LAST

310
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
FEW MOMENTS, HOUSE DEMOCRATS

311
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CAME OUT AFTER CLOSED-DOOR

312
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
MEETING SAYING THEY'RE

313
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
HEARING THAT RANK-AND-FILE

314
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE

315
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ALREADY REJECTED BOEHNER-CANTOR

316
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
PLAN.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO THE

317
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SHORT-TERM PLAN B.

318
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY

319
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
REID SAYS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE

320
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PLAN B WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH

321
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE SENATE CHAMBER.

322
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SO WE'RE STILL BASICALLY

323
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
STUCK, JON.

324
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
JON: THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A

325
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
PLAN B, MAYBE WISHING FOR IT

326
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
BUT HOW MUCH OF A CHANCE IS

327
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THERE THEY GET THE BIGGER

328
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
DEAL DONE?

329
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> Reporter: RIGHT.

330
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SO-CALLED PLAN A WHICH HAS

331
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ALWAYS BEEN ON THE TABLE.

332
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID LINE ON

333
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
RAISING TACK SHOULD BE

334
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
$250,000.

335
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BOEHNER BELIEVES IT SHOULD

336
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
BE A MILLION DOLLARS OR

337
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
MORE.
THE PRESIDENT BEHIND THE

338
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SCENES PRIVATELY AGREED TO

339
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MOVE IT TO 400,000, CLOSER

340
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
TO BOEHNER'S MILLION DOLLAR

341
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
LINE.

342
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
JAY CARNEY SAYS THEY'RE

343
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WILLING TO DO SPENDING CUTS

344
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
BUT THIS DEAL HAS TO INCLUDE

345
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
RAISING TACKS ON THE RICH.

346
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

347
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> HE WOULD VETO ANY

348
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
LEGISLATION GOT TO HIS DEBT

349
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THAT WOULD EXTEND TAX CUTS

350
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
FOR THE TOP 2%.

351
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
ANY DEAL THAT ATTEMPTED TO

352
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
REDUCE OUR DEFICIT BROADLY

353
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
FOR THE LONG TERM, A BIGGER

354
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DEAL, THAT HE HAS BEEN

355
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SEEKING HAS TO BE BALANCED.

356
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> Reporter: BUT NOW ALSO

357
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

358
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DEBT CEILING COMING DUE IN A

359
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

360
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO RAISE

361
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THAT DEBT CEILING FOR TWO

362
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
YEARS.
JOHN BOEHNER WE'RE TOLD PUT

363
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
AN EXTENSION OF ONE YEAR ON

364
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THE TABLE.
I THINK THE VERY BOTTOM LINE

365
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WITH PLAN A AND PLAN B, THEY

366
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
MADE BABY STEPS IN PROGRESS

367
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
MAYBE BUT THEY'RE STILL FAR

368
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
APART FROM A DEAL TO AVERT

369
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THIS FISCAL CLIFF, JON.

370
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
MAYBE IT'S PLAN-C.

371
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
IF A AND B AREN'T GOING TO

372
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WORK, THEY HAVE TO DO

373
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SOMETHING IN THE SHORT TERM

374
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
HERE TO GET THROUGH THIS

375
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
CRISIS, JON.
JON: WHERE YOU'RE STANDING

376
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN CAN

377
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
YOU SEE THE EDGE OF THE

378
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
BLITZKRIEG.

568
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY

569
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
WILL TRY TO STEAL MONEY FROM

570
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS

571
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

572
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
ADAM SHAPIRO FROM THE FOX

573
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
BUSINESS NETWORK WITH ALL OF

574
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THIS.

575
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
QUITE A STORY ADAM.

576
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WHO IS BEING TARGETED HERE

577
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AND ARE WE ALL AT RISK?

578
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
>> ACCORDING TO McAFEE LABS

579
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THEY'RE TAKING THIS AS A

580
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CREDIBLE THREAT.

581
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
PART OF RUSSIAN HACKERS PART

582
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
OF A CRIMINAL UNDERGROUND

583
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
AND TARGETING HIGH NET WORTH

584
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
INDIVDUALS.
THEY HAVE ALREADY ACCORDING

585
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TO McAFEE KIND OF RUN THE

586
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TROJAN THAT IS GETTING INTO

587
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
THE COMPUTER AND ALLOWS THEM

588
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
TO GET INTO YOUR BANK

589
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
ACCOUNT.

590
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THEY HAVE DONE THIS TO 300

591
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TO 500 PEOPLE SINCE ABOUT

592
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
2007.
THE CYBER HACKERS ARE

593
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
CLAIMING TO HAVE TRANSFERRED

594
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
ABOUT $5 MILLION AS THEY DO

595
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THIS.

596
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
ESSENTIALLY IT IS HIGH NET

597
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
WORTH INDIVDUALS AT ROUGHLY

598
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
30 INSTITUTIONS IN THE

599
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
UNITED STATES.

600
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT

601
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
NAMED BUT THEY'RE GOING

602
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
AFTER NATIONAL BANKS,

603
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
INVESTMENT BANKS.

604
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
SO YOU HAVE TO PROTECT

605
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
YOURSELF BUT THEY TAKE THIS

606
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
AS A CREDIBLE THREAT.

607
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
JENNA: A CREDIBLE THREAT.

608
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WE KNOW ABOUT IT, WE'RE TALK

609
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS.

610
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
ARE THE BANKS PREPARED FOR

611
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THIS?
>> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT

612
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
QUESTION.

613
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
FIRST OF ALL THE ATTACK WAS

614
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SUPPOSED TO COME SOMETIME

615
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THIS SPRING.

616
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

617
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THIS FALL.

618
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
McAFEE BELIEVES IT WILL

619
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
HAPPEN THIS SPRING.

620
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
HE SPOKE WITH FREDERICK

621
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
LAYTON, THEY ARE A STRATEGIC

622
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
RISK CONSULTANCY

623
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ORGANIZATION.
THEY SPECIALIZE IN CYBER

624
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
INTELLIGENCE ISSUES.

625
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
HE TELLS ME, THIS IS DIRECT

626
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
QUOTE, THAT THE BANKS ARE

627
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
NOT COMPLETELY READY FOR

628
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THIS ATTACK.

629
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
McAFEE'S REPORT IS A

630
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
THOROUGH EXAMINATION AND THE

631
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
BANKS ARE GETTING READY FOR

632
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THIS EVENT THE BEST THING

633
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
YOU CAN DO IF YOU HAVE ANY

634
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
CONCERN ABOUT THIS, CHECK

635
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
YOUR ACCOUNTS DAILY.

636
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
YOU CAN REPORT ANY BIZARRE

637
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
ACTIVITY TO THE BANK BUT YOU

638
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
HAVE TO CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT

639
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
DALELY.
THAT COMES FROM AN EXPERT.

640
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
JENNA: VERY INTERESTING.
WE HAD A CYBERSECURITY

641
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
EXPERT ON OUR SHOW LAST WEEK

642
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
THAT SAID IF YOU WANT TO USE

643
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
APPS, APPS ON THE iPHONE FOR

644
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
EXAMPLE, THOSE CAN BE MORE

645
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
SAFE THAN GOING ONLINE.

646
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
>> WRONG.
JENNA: REALLY?

647
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD US.

648
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THIS ADVICE FROM THE CIA.

649
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
>> I ASKED FREDERICK LATE

650
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
TON.

651
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'M NOT A CYBER EXPERT.

652
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
LAYTON SPENT MORE THAN TWO

653
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
DECADES IN MILITARY

654
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
INTELLIGENCE, PART OF THE

655
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
NSA.

656
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
HE SAID THERE IS BELIEF THAT

657
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YOU HAVE APPLE DEVICES

658
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
YOU'RE MORE PROTECTED THEN

659
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IF YOU'RE USING IBM BASED

660
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
DEVICE, SUCH AS A PC.

661
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
HE SAYS THAT IS NOT

662
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
ACCURATE.
JENNA: THEY HAVE A

663
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
>> Reporter: THE EXPERTS DO.

664
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
JENNA: GOOD TO CHECK YOUR

665
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
ACCOUNT.
THANK YOU, ADAM.

666
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
JON: MY SOLUTION?

667
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I HAVE TWO KIDS IN COLLEGE

668
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AND DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY IN

669
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THE BANK ACCOUNT.

670
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
JENNA: THAT IS HOW IT WORKS.

671
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
JON: I AM NOT A TARGET OF

672
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
HACKERS.

673
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
JENNA: JON SCOTT, DON'T

674
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
TARGET HIM.
EMPTY POCKETS.

675

INTO PARTS OF THE U.S. WHAT

677
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
IT COULD MEAN FOR HOLIDAY

678

TRAVEL AS MILLIONS GET READY

679

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU WILL

SEE A WHOLE LOT OF IT FROM

747
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THIS NEXT SYSTEM.

748
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SOME OF THAT SNOW MAY STAY

SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL

771
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
ACCUMULATION OF THE SEASON.

772
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WATCHES

773
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS.

774
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
EVERYONE STAY ALERT.

775
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
TRAVEL WILL BE IMPACTS AS WE

776
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HEAD INTO MIDWEEK AND ALSO

777
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THURSDAY.

778
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT AHEAD OF

779
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THE STORM SYSTEM, JENNA,

780
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM UP.

781
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
WE'LL SEE THUNDERSTORMS AND

782
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER

783
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000

788
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
AND EVEN INTO ARKANSAS.

789
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT

790
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WE WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE

791
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ON.

792
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
JENNA: GOOD HEAD'S UP FOR US

793
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000

>> THANK YOU.

796
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
JON: RIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS

797
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, ARE

798
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
POURING OVER EVIDENCE AT TWO

799
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
CRIME SCENES IN A SEARCH FOR

800
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
ANSWERS IN THE DEADLY

801
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

802
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
ELEMENTARY.
SO EXACTLY WHAT ARE THEY

803
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
LOOKING FOR AND HOW LONG

804
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WILL THIS INVESTIGATION

805
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
TAKE?
BILL DALY IS FORMER FBI

806
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000

807
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000

SECURITY CONSULTING.

810
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM

811
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE, HE'S

812
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE

813
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
POLICEMAN WHO HAS BEEN SORT

814
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OF THE FACE OF THIS

815
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
INVESTIGATION, HE SAID WE'RE

816
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
GOING TO GET TO THE HARD

817
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
DRIVE, WE'LL GET ALL THAT

818
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
EVIDENCE OFF HIS COMPUTER

819
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT

820
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WHAT WAS BEHIND THIS RAMPAGE.

821
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
TODAY WE'RE FINDING OUT THAT

822
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THE COMPUTER HARD DRIVE HAS

823
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
BEEN SMASHED APPARENTLY BY

824
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
THE GUNMAN BEFORE HE LEFT.

825
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
SO DOES THAT MEAN IT'S GOING

826
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
TO BE NOT POSSIBLE TO GET

827
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
THE INFORMATION?

828
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
>> THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO,

829
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
JON.
THE AREA OF COMPUTER

830
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
FORENSICS AND EXAMINATION OF

831
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
DAMAGED HARD DRIVES TURNED

832
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
INTO A SCIENCE.
IT IS A KEY TOOL IN THE TOOL

833
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
BOX FOR INVESTIGATORS THESE

834
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
DAYS WITH ALL THE THINGS WE

835
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
TOUCH, CRIMINALS TOUCH,

836
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE

837
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
A COMPUTER IS IMPORTANT.

838
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
WHAT THEY CAN DO THEY MAY BE

839
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
ABLE TO RECREATE PART OF

840
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THAT.
EVEN IF IT IS PHYSICALLY

841
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
DAMAGED THERE ARE WAYS TO

842
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
RECREATE THE DRIVES.

843
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I WORKED ON CASES WHERE THE

844
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
COMPUTERS WERE INVOLVED IN

845
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
FIRES.

846
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
YOU CAN RETRIEVE INFORMATION

847
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THAT IS HELPFUL.

848
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THEY CAN LOOK AT PERIPHERAL

849
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
DEVICES AND BUFFERS AND

850
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
MEMORIES.
LOOK AT SEARCH ENGINES,

851
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT WOULD

852
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
HELP PUT THIS PERSON, THE

853
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
GUNMAN IN FOCUS.

854
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
JON: MAYBE YOUR PRINTER OR

855
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
WEB SEARCHES OR GO TO GOOGLE

856
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
OR ONE OF THESE OTHER SEARCH

857
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
ENGINES AND FIND OUT WHAT HE

858
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WAS UP TO?

859
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
>> EXACTLY.

860
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THEY CAN GO OUT TO THAT.

861
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
ANY ONLINE MAIL SERVICES.

862
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
SEE THOSE TYPE OF ACT

863
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
EVIDENT IT IS.
SO IT'S, FOR INVESTIGATORS

864
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THERE REALLY IS KIND OF

865
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
POTENTIAL TREASURE TROVE,

866
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
POTENTIAL I SAY, FOR THINGS

867
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THAT MAY PUT THIS PERSON,

868
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THIS GUNMAN IN FOCUS.

869
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
NOT TO SAY THAT IT WILL AT

870
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THE END OF THE DAY PROVIDE

871
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
THE CRYSTAL CLEAR, YOU KNOW,

872
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
IMAGE OF WHAT HE WAS UP TO

873
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
OR MAYBE EVEN WHAT LED TO

874
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THE TRAGEDY LAST WEEK BUT IT

875
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE SOME

876
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
BACKGROUND AND SOME EVIDENCE,

877
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I BELIEVE, TOWARDS WHAT HE

878
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
WAS DOING ON AN EVERYDAY

879
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
BASIS.
JON: BUT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT

880
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
WANT TO ASK, WHY BOTHER?

881
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
YOU KNOW THAT THE GUNMAN DID

882
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
THIS.

883
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
PROBABLY HAD SOME MENTAL

884
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ISSUES.

885
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
HE'S DEAD.

886
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM

887
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
PUTTING TOGETHER ALL THE

888
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
STEPS HE TOOK GOING UP TO

889
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THAT MOMENT?

890
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
>> WELL THERE ARE A COUPLE

891
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
OF THINGS.

892
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
ONE FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE

893
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
STANDPOINT YOU WANT TO MAKE
SURE THERE WERE NO OTHER

894
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE AWARE OF

895
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

896
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
JON: THAT HE DIDN'T

897
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
COMMUNICATE HIS PLANS TO

898
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
ANYBODY?
>> COMMUNICATE TO ANYONE.

899
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
ALSO ON THE FORENSIC SIDE

900
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT AS THE

901
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
LIEUTENANT MENTIONED ON THE

902
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
FIREARMS SIDE.

903
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN

904
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HE WENT TO THE RANGE

905
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
ALLEGEDLY TO TO SHOOTING WAS

906
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
HE THERE PROPERLY AND

907
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
PROPERLY LICENSED.

908
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
SOMEWHERE PEOPLE ALONG THE

909
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
LINE MAY HAVE LEGAL EXPOSURE

910
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
PAUSE OF THINGS THEY SHOULD

911
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
HAVE OR SHOULD NOT HAVE

912
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
DO.
HOW FAR FROM THAT STANDPOINT,

913
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE'S

914
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
DOING AND MAN IN FOCUS AS WE

915
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
WOULD SAY, UNDERSTAND HOW WE

916
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREDICT

917
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THESE THINGS IN THE FUTURE.

918
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
YES, WE CAN'T GO BACK AND

919
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
CHANGE THE TRAGEDY OF LAST

920
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
WEEK.

921
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WE WISH WE COULD.

922
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WE MAY BE ABLE TO PREVENT

923
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THE THINGS IN THE FUTURE

924
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
UNDERSTANDING WHAT LED THIS

925
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
PERSON.
WHAT WAS THE BACKGROUND?

926
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
WHAT WAS HIS MENTAL

927
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
CONDITION?

928
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WHAT WAS HIS PHYSICAL

929
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
CONDITION?
WAS HE ON MEDICATION?

930
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
WHO WAS HE COMMUNICATING

931
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
WITH?
WHAT THINGS WAS HE LOOKING

932
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
AT?

933
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THAT MAY HELP PROFILE FUTURE

934
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
CASES.
JON: BILL DALY WITH CONTROL

935
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
RISKS SECURITY.

1117
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
BLACK MARK ON THE WORLD MAP

1118

1119
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
WORLD WAR.
THEY ARE MAKING PLANS FOR A

1120
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000

1121
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
DANGEROUS FOR THE FUTURE OF

1123
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
OF EUROPE ITSELF.

1124
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
IS THAT BLUSTER OR IS THAT A

1125
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SERIOUS THREAT?
>> YOU KNOW I THINK IT COULD

1126
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
BE A SERIOUS THREAT AND IT

1127
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
IS ALSO BLUSTER.

1128
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I THINK IT'S BOTH.

1129
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IRAN

1130
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
INCREASINGLY PANICKING

1131
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
BECAUSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON

1132
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
IN SYRIA.

1133
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
YOU SEE REPORTS TODAY THERE

1134
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
ARE JUST THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

1135
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
POURING OVER THE BORDER INTO

1136
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
LEBANON, INTO TURKEY AS

1137
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
WELL.

1138
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
JENNA: REFUGEES.

1139
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
>> THESE ARE REFUGEES OR

1140
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
OTHERS JUST TRYING TO GET

1141
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
OUT.
SO ONE CLEAR THING IS THAT

1142
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THE IRANIANS HAVE ONE ALLY

1143
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
IN THE REGION WHICH IS

1144
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
SYRIA.

1145
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
IF SYRIA IS NOW IMPLODING

1146
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
AND ASSAD IS GOING TO BE

1147
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
DONE I THINK THAT CHANGES

1148
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE WHOLE MAP.

1149
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WE'RE ENTERING A WHOLE NEW

1150
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
PHASE.
I THINK WE, THE UNITED

1151
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
STATES, WE HAVE TO BE

1152
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
PREPARED FOR THAT NEW PHASE

1153
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
OF IRANIANS PANICKING.

1154
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
JENNA: LET'S TALK A LITTLE

1155
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IN
THE LAST 21 MONTHS, SEEMS

1156
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THE STORY AS WE'VE BEEN

1157
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
TELLING IT WILL END IF AND

1158
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WHEN ASSAD LEAVES OR FALLS.

1159
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT

1160
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
YOU'RE SAYING, THAT IS JUST

1161
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
WHERE THE STORY BEGINS.

1162
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> THAT IS JUST THE

1163
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
BEGINNING.
WE HAVE IRANIAN ELECTIONS

1164
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
COMING UP IN JUNE.

1165
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THAT I THINK IS A BIG MOMENT

1166
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
HERE.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHOULD

1167
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
BE CALLING FOR REGIME

1168
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CHANGE.

1169
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WE'VE HAD THE WORLD TRYING

1170
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH

1171
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
OPPOSITION GROUPS IN SYRIA

1172
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
ARE BEST TO SUPPORT.

1173
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH.

1174
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME.

1175
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
IT HAS TAKEN 18 MONTHS FOR

1176
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THE U.N. TO DECIDE.

1177
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
HOWEVER IN IRAN WE ALREADY

1178
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
HAVE AN OPPOSITION GROUP.

1179
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THE LARGEST OPPOSITION GROUP

1180
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
IS ALREADY ORGANIZED.

1181
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THEY MEET REGULARLY.

1182
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THEY ARTICULATED A POLICY

1183
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
THAT SAYS WE DON'T WANT A

1184
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
SO WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING

1185
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THAT GROUP.

1186
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE

1187
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
UNITED STATES, OUR PRESIDENT,

1188
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
SHOULD SAY, VERY CLEARLY,

1189
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THAT WE WANT REGIME CHANGE

1190
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
IN IRAN.

1191
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
JENNA: HOW DO WE DO THAT?

1192
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
BEYOND JUST THE VERY PUBLIC

1193
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
STATE THAT YOU JUST

1194
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
MENTIONED, WHAT ELSE CAN BE

1195
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
DONE?
HOW DOES THE CHAOS IN SYRIA,

1196
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
MAYBE SET US UP FOR

1197
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAN

1198
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
OTHERWISE IF THAT WASN'T

1199
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
HAPPENING?

1200
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> WELL I THINK WE'VE GOT TO

1201
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
BE PREPARED.

1202
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FINDING

1203
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
OUT IN SYRIA.
WE'RE SEEING THAT WE WEREN'T

1204
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
PREPARED.
GROUPS ARE SCRAMBLING AND

1205
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
AGAIN, WE HAD, YOU KNOW,

1206
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
EUROPEANS, THE FRENCH AND

1207
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
BRITISH IT RECOGNIZING THE

1208
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SYRIAN OPPOSITION BEFORE WE

1209
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
DID.
BEFORE THE UNITED STATES

1210
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
DID.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD

1211
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
FOR THE FUTURE OF SYRIA.

1212
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER

1213
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THAT.
SO I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO

1214
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
IRAN, WE HAVE TO WORK WITH

1215
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THOSE GROUPS NOW, HELP THEM

1216
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
ORGANIZE.

1217
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
AND TRY TO GET THEM TO THE

1218
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
POINT WHERE THEY COULD TAKE

1219
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OVER IMMEDIATELY PEACEFULLY.

1220
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
LET'S TRY TO DO IT WITHOUT A

1221
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
WAR.
JENNA: HOW DO WE DO THAT IN

1222
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
SUCH A CLOSED COUNTRY?

1223
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> WITH THE ELECTIONS IT IS

1224
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

1225
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SIX MONTHS

1226
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW WE

1227
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SUPPORT THE GREEN

1228
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
REVOLUTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT

1229
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
LAST TIME.

1230
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
HE WILL HAVE TO REALLY LOOK

1231
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
FOR SIGNS.

1232
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I THINK THEY'RE ALREADY

1233
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHERE

1234
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THE OPPOSITION IS BEGINNING

1235
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
TO RAISE THEIR HEAD AND SAY,

1236
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WE'D LIKE TO OVERTHROW OUR

1237
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
GOVERNMENT.
CAN YOU HELP?

1238
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THAT'S WHEN WE CAN JUMP IN.

1239
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

1240
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
TWITTER AND THE INTERNET IS

1241
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
NOT BLOCKED SO THAT PEOPLE

1242
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
CAN ORGANIZE.

1243
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM WITH

1244
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
ARMS IF THEY HAVE, IF THEY

1245
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
NEED THEM.

1246
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
JENNA: YOU'RE SAYING BE VERY

1247
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
AGGRESSIVE HERE?

1248
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> BE VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH

1249
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
ORGANIZATION.

1250
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
MUCH LIKE WE'RE DOING IN

1251
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
SYRIA NOW EVEN THOUGH IT

1252
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
TOOK A LONG TIME.

1253
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
JENNA: SOME SAY IF WE TAKE

1254
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
AWAY AHMADINEJAD, WHO IS THE

1255
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
PRESIDENT THERE NOW WE DON'T

1256
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
DO MUCH BECAUSE THE

1257
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
AYATOLLAH.

1258
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> THE SUPREME LEADER

1259
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
CONTROLS FOREIGN POLICY.

1260
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
JENNA: HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE

1261
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THAT?
>> THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS IS

1262
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
FOR AHMADINEJAD'S POSITION.

1263
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1264
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
IS CREATE INSTABILITY OR

1265
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
HELP THE INSTABILITY THAT'S

1266
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
ALREADY THERE AND REALLY

1267
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
PUSH THEM FORWARD BECAUSE IT

1268
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
IS ALREADY THERE.

1269
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WE JUST HAVE TO TAP IN.

1270
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
JENNA: A LITTLE BIT COUNTER

1271
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
INTUITIVE THIS POLICY.

1272
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
COMFORTABLE WITH CHAOS

1273
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
BECAUSE CHAOS COULD LEAD TO

1274
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
ONE OF THE MOST ORGANIZED

1275
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
RESULTS EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY

1276
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.

1277
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> WE DON'T HAVE PEACE RIGHT

1278
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
NOW.
IT MIGHT APPEAR TO BE STABLE

1279
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
BUT IT IS NOT PEACEFUL.

1280
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THESE PEOPLE DON'T

1281
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
EXPERIENCE PEACE INSIDE IRAN.

1282
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
JENNA: NICE TO HAVE YOU ON

1283
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
SET WITH US.

1284
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
PLEASURE ALWAYS TO HAVE YOU

1285
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
ON THE PROGRAM.
>> THANKS.

1286
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
JENNA: JON?

1287
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
JON: JUST IN AN UPDATE ON

1288
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ONE OF THE STRANGER MEDIA

1289
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
EVENTS I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN

1290
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
IN MY CAREER.

1291
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THAT IS THE SCANDAL THAT LED

1292
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TO THE RESIGNATION OF FORMER

1293
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
FOUR-STAR ARMY GENERAL AND

1294
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
CIA DIRECTOR-GENERAL DAVID

1295
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
PETRAEUS.
ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED

1296
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
PRESS PAULA BROAD WELL, THE

1297
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
TAMPA SOCIALITE WILL NOT BE

1298
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
PROSECUTED FOR E-MAILS SHE

1299
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
SENT TO JILL KELLEY.

1300
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

1301
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
LOOKED INTO WHETHER THE

1302
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
E-MAILS THAT BROADWELL SENT

1303
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
TO KELLY WARNINGER HAD TO

1304
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
STAY AWAY FROM THE MARRIED

1305
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
GENERAL.
I SHOULD MENTION BROADWELL

1306
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WAS MARRIED AS WELL AS WAS

1307
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
KELLY.

1308
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THOSE E-MAILS DID NOT AMOUNT

1309
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TO CYBER STALKING.

1310
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000

1312
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

1313
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
SO FOR NOW, PAULA BROADWELL

1314
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
IS OFF THE HOOK AT LEAST IN

1315
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THAT PART OF THIS VERY

1316
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
STRANGE CASE.

1317
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED.

1318
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>>> THERE ARE NEW

1319
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FISCAL

1320
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
CLIFFHANGER WITH THE

1321
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WHITE HOUSE REJECTING HOUSE

1322
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER'S PLAN
B.

1323
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
THAT JUST HAPPENED WITHIN

1324
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THE LAST 40 MINUTES.

1325
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ALL THIS AS REPUBLICAN

1326
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
LAWMAKERS NOW MAKE THE CASE

1327
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
FOR BOOSTING REVENUE THROUGH

1328
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
TAX REFORM.

1329
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
ONE OF THEM WILL BE HERE

1330
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
LIVE TO EXPLAIN WHY HE

1331
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THINKS THAT IS THE FISCALLY

1332
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH.

1333
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
PLUS, REMEMBERING SENATOR

1334
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
INOUYE, THE WAR HERO WHO

1335
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
BECAME ONE OF THE LONGEST

1336
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
SERVING SENATORS IN AMERICAN

1337
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
HISTORY.

1338
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
HOW HIS LEGACY STRETCHED FAR

1339
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
BEYOND HIS HOME STATE OF

1340
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
HAWAII.

1341
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
THAT'S NEXT

1342
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
JENNA: WELL THAT WAS QUICK.

1343
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
WE HEARD FROM JOHN BOEHNER,

1344
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER EARLIER

1345
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
TODAY SAYING HE HAD A PLAN B

1346
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
FOR THE FISCAL CLIFF

1347
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
COMPROMISE.
HE WOULD PUT FORWARD

1348
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
LEGISLATION SO THAT ANYONE

1349
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
EARNING LESS THAN A MILLION

1350
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
DOLLARS WOULD NOT SEE THEIR

1351
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
TAXES GO UP AT THE END OF

1352
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THE YEAR.
WELL THE WHITE HOUSE CAME

1353
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
OUT AND OFFICIALLY SAID NO

1354
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
TO PLAN B.

1355
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WE WERE HERING FROM JAY

1356
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
CARNEY.

1357
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
OF COURSE THE PRESS

1358
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SECRETARY FOR THE PRESIDENT

1359
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
SAYING THE SPEAKER'S PLAN B

1360
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
APPROACH DOESN'T MEET THIS

1361
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
TEST OF A BALANCED APPROACH

1362
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
BECAUSE IT CAN'T PASS THE

1363
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SENATE AND THEREFORE WILL

1364
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
NOT PROTECT THE MIDDLE

1365
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
CLASS.
GOES ON IN THE STATEMENT TO

1366
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
SAY BASICALLY, GAME ON.

1367
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
AS ED HENRY TOLD US COME ON

1368
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
PLAN-C, RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

1369
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
FOR.

1370
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
PLAN A IS NOT WORKING OUT SO

1371
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
WELL BECAUSE NEGOTIATIONS
ARE NOT MAKING A LOT OF

1372
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
PROGRESS, BABY STEPS.

1373
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
PLAN B SPEAKER PUT FORWARD

1374
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
TODAY, REJECTED BY THE

1375
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
WHITE HOUSE.

1376
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SO MAYBE PLAN-C, JON, PLAN-C.

1377
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
JON: AS YOU WELLPOINTED OUT.

1378
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
JENNA: HERE GOING TO TALK A

1379
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT THIS

1380
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
ALL MEANS NOW.
JON: WHAT A WAY TO RUN A

1381
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
COUNTRY, HUH?

1382
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
>>> THERE IS A NEW CALL FOR

1383
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
RAISING TAX REVENUE OR

1384
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
INCREASING REVENUE AND IT

1385
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
COMES AMID EFFORTS TO HAMMER

1386
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
OUT A DEAL ON THE SO-CALLED

1387
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

1388
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN SCOTT

1389
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
REQUIRING GEL, OUTSPOKEN

1390
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
CRITIC OF ANTI-TAX PLEDGE IS

1391
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
LAYING OUT THE CONSERVATIVE

1392
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
CASE BOOSTING TAX REVENUE

1393
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
THROUGH TAX REFORM.

1394
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THE CONGRESSMAN JOINS US

1395
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
NOW.
HE SERVES ON THE HOUSE

1396
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
HOMELAND SECURITIES SERVICES

1397
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
COMMITTEE.

1398
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
CONGRESSMAN RIGEL, YOU WROTE

1399
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
A LETTER TO EVERY SINGLE

1400
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND SAID

1401
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
YOU'RE UP FOR BOOSTING TAX

1402
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
REVENUE?
>> WELL, JON, THANK YOU FOR

1403
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
HAVING ME ON THE SHOW.

1404
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
AMERICA HAS A SPENDING

1405
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
PROBLEM PRINCIPALLY AND MY

1406
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
VOTES REFLECT A DEEP RESOLVE

1407
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
TO CAST A DIFFICULT VOTE TO

1408
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
REDUCE FEDERAL SPENDING BUT

1409
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'M A BUSINESSMAN IN MY

1410
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
FIRST ELECTED OFFICE.

1411
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
A CAREFUL REVIEW OF OUR TAX

1412
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
CODE AND ITS YIELD OVER 12

1413
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
YEARS REALLY MAKES CLEAR TO

1414
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
ME THAT AS REPUBLICANS ARE

1415
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
LOCKING OURSELVES INTO THIS

1416
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
CURRENT TAX CODE THROUGH THE

1417
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM

1418
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
PLEDGE HAVE LOCKED US INTO A

1419
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
LEVEL OF REVENUE THAT WE'VE

1420
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
NOT REDUCED

1421
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
WHAT IT MEANS FOR ME TO BE A

1422
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
CONSERVATIVE, A FISCAL

1423
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
CONSERVATIVE, TO MAKE SURE

1424
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
WE VOTE FOR A LEVEL OF

1425
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
REVENUE THAT AT LEAST

1426
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
MATCHES THE LEVEL OF

1427
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
EXPENDITURES WE OURSELVES

1428
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
HAVE VOTED FOR.

1429
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
JON: YOU HAVE OFFERED OR

1430
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
SUGGESTED RAISING WHAT, $800

1431
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
BILLION THROUGH CLOSING THE

1432
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
LOOPHOLES?

1433
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
ISN'T THAT WHAT CONGRESSMAN

1434
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
BOEHNER, SPEAKER BOEHNER

1435
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
OFFERED TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1436
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
AND WAS REJECTED SO FAR?

1437
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
>> WELL, YES.

1438
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT

1439
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
CAPPING DEDUCTIONS IS THE

1440
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
FIRST PLACE WE'VE GOT TO GO

1441
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
IN REFORMING OUR TAX CODE.

1442
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
PART OF THE APPEAL, JON IS

1443
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THE SIMPLICITY OF IT.

1444
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
YOU CAN JUST IMPLEMENT IT,

1445
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE A $50,000

1446
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
CAP.

1447
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THAT IS HYPOTHETICAL NUMBER

1448
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
BUT IT REALLY DOES GENERATE

1449
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
THE REVENUE THAT WE NEED TO

1450
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
AT LEAST PAY FOR THE LEVEL

1451
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
OF EXPENDITURES THAT WE

1452
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
OURSELVES AS REPUBLICANS

1453
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
HAVE VOTED FOR.

1454
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
AND THAT'S WHY I'M IN

1455
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
SUPPORT OF THE SPEAKER'S

1456
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
EFFORTS TO BOTH REDUCE

1457
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
SPENDING AND ALSO HAVE A

1458
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
MODEST LEVEL OF INCOME

1459
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
INCLUDED IN AN OVERALL

1460
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
AGREEMENT.

1461
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
JON: WILL YOU BE OPEN TO AN

1462
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
INCREASE IN TAX RATES, FOR

1463
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
INSTANCE THE HIGHEST

1464
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
EARNERS?

1465
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS THOSE

1466
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
MAKING MORE THAN $250,000 A

1467
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
YEAR SHOULD PAY MORE.

1468
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
>> WELL WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT

1469
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
NOW IS I AM ADVOCATING FOR

1470
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
AN AGREEMENT THAT IS

1471
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
SIMULTANEOUS.

1472
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
THAT MEANS REDUCING FEDERAL

1473
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
SPENDING AND ALSO HAVING

1474
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
REVENUES RISE A LITTLE BIT.

1475
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO ASKING

1476
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
MY, EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD

1477
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
VOTE ON, I REALLY NEED TO

1478
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THAT

1479
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
BECAUSE I NEED TO SEE WHAT

1480
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THE TOTAL AGREEMENT IS.

1481
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
WHAT ARE WE DOING, FOR

1482
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO THE

1483
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
DEBT LIMIT?
IT WOULD BE A GREAT CONCERN

1484
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
OF MINE IF THE DEBT LIMIT IS

1485
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
INCORPORATED INTO THIS

1486
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
AGREEMENT.
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE

1487
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
SEPARATE.
SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF

1488
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THINGS I'LL BE LOOKING FOR

1489
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
AND IT'S REALLY A DYNAMIC

1490
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
ENVIRONMENT, JON.

1491
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
WE JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING

1492
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
OF COURSE OF THE PLAN B

1493
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
OPTION.

1494

01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PUSHING

1858
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
FORWARD WITH SOME KIND OF GUN

1859
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
CONTROL, BUT HE'S BEEN VERY

1860
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
SHORT ON SPECIFICS THUS FAR.

1861
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, JON.

1862
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
NOT SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS.

1863
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
THE ONLY ONE THAT IS PRETTY

1864
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
SPECIFIC SO FAR UP ON CAPITOL

1865
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
HILL IS FROM SENATOR DIANNE

1866
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
FEINSTEIN WHO HAS THE OUTLINES

1867
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
OF A BILL READY TO GO FOR THE

1868
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
NEW CONGRESS, A BILL THAT WOULD

1869
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
ESSENTIALLY INSTITUTE THE

1870
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN BACK FROM

1871
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
THE MID '90s AND ALSO HAVE

1872
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
SOME VERY STRICT RESTRICTIONS ON

1873
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
THE AMMUNITION, THE ROUNDS, THE

1874
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
CLIPS, THE AMOUNT OF ROUNDS IN A

1875
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
CLIP.

1876
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
AND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC BUT ALSO

1877
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
GRANDFATHERS IN A NUMBER OF

1878
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
WEAPONS.
THAT'S A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

1879
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
THAT FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE'LL PUT

1880
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
UP.
YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THESE

1881
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
LAWMAKERS, DEMOCRATS -- ALL --

1882
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
JOE MANCHIN, MARK WARNER FROM

1883
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
VIRGINIA, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

1884
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
FROM NEW YORK.

1885
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
ALL OF THEM PRO-GUN LAWMAKERS,

1886
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
ALSO WE SHOULD POINT OUT THE

1887
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, HARRY

1888
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
REID, IS BACKED BY THE NRA, HAS

1889
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
A PRO-GUN LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

1890
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
AND HAS ALSO SIGNALED THAT HE,

1891
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
TOO, WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

1892
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
SOMETHING.

1893
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
HOW THIS MOVES FORWARD, I THINK,

1894
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
IS REALLY THE QUESTION.

1895
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
AND THE COMMISSION IS OFTEN A

1896
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
WAY THAT WASHINGTON DEALS WITH

1897
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
BIG, CONTROVERSIAL THINGS.

1898
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE ATTRACTIVE

1899
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
TO SOME FOLKS AND SOME

1900
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
REPUBLICANS WHO REALLY WANT

1901
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
MENTAL HEALTH TO BE CONSIDERED

1902
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
AS WELL AS VIDEO GAMES AND

1903
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
HOLLYWOOD'S IMPACT ON OUR

1904
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
CULTURE.

1905
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
JON: WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY

1906
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
CARNEY HAS BEEN ASKED ABOUT THAT

1907
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
AND WHAT GUN CONTROL PLAYS IN

1908
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
THE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION.

1909
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
LET ME PLAY THAT EXCHANGE FOR

1910
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
YOU, BRET.

1911
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
>> IN THE COMPREHENSIVE

1912
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
SOLUTION, DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR

1913
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
AND ACCURATE TO SAY THAT

1914
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE, GUN

1915
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
CONTROL WOULD HAVE TO BE PART OF

1916
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
IT?
>> I THINK THAT IT'S PART OF IT,

1917
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
BUT IT IS FAR FROM ALL OF IT,

1918
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
AND AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT

1919
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
HAS TAKEN POSITIONS ON COMMON

1920
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
SENSE MEASURES THAT HE BELIEVES

1921
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HELP ADDRESS

1922
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
THIS PROBLEM, BUT HE MADE CLEAR

1923
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE, THAT

1924
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
WE AS A NATION HAVE NOT DONE

1925
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
ENOUGH, CLEARLY, TO FULFILL OUR

1926
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
NUMBER ONE OBLIGATION WHICH IS

1927
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
TO PROTECT OUR CHIRP.

1928
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
OUR CHILDREN.

1929
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
JON: IT SEEMS THAT, YOU KNOW,

1930
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS POLITICAL

1931
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
CAPITAL RIGHT NOW.

1932
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
HE WON RE-ELECTION.

1933
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
IF HE WANTS GUN CONTROL, IT

1934
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
SEEMS LIKE HE SHOULD BE A LITTLE

1935
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
MORE FORCEFUL IN TALKING ABOUT

1936
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
IT.

1937
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
>> WELL, I THINK IN COMING DAYS

1938
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
YOU MAY SEE MORE PUSH FROM THE

1939
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
WHITE HOUSE ON THIS, AND I THINK

1940
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE THE ALLIES

1941
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
IN THE SENATE LIKE SENATOR

1942
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
FEINSTEIN MOVE THIS FORWARD.

1943
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
AND I THINK WHEN YOU'RE STARTING

1944
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
TO HEAR AND SEE SOME OF THESE

1945
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE TRACK RECORDS

1946
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
OF REALLY PUSHING BACK ON ANY

1947
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
EFFORT OF GUN CONTROL IN THE

1948
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
PAST LIKE MANCHIN WHO YOU MAY

1949
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
REMEMBER RAN IN A CAMPAIGN AT

1950
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
ONE POINT RUNNING AN AD IN THAT

1951
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
CAMPAIGN FIRING A RIFLE AT A

1952
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
CLIMATE CHANGE BILL, YOU KNOW, I

1953
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
MEAN, THIS IS A GUY THAT RAN

1954
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
TOUTING HIS GUN-OWNING AND

1955
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
HUNTING SKILLS AS PART OF HIS

1956
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
CAMPAIGN.
WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE

1957
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
NEED FOR CHANGE, YOU START TO

1958
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
SEE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THINGS.

1959
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
AT LEAST IN THE MIDDLE.

1960
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE THE

1961
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
PUSHBACK WHEN THE NRA GETS

1962
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
INVOLVED, AND I THINK THAT

1963
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
YOU'LL SEE THAT --

1964
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
JON: RIGHT.

1965
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
>> -- IN COMING DAYS.

1966
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
JON: THEY HAVE STAYED LARGELY

1967
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
SILENT, ENTIRELY SILENT, BUT

1968
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
THEY SAY THEY ARE APPARENTLY

1969
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
ABOUT TO PUSH BACK.

1970
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
STICK AROUND WITH US, BRET, WE

1971
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
HAVE ANOTHER BIG STORY IN

1972
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
WASHINGTON TODAY, JENNA HAS THAT

1973
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
FOR US.
JENNA: NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE

1974
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
REALLY ONLY EMPHASIZING THE OLD

1975
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
STATUS QUO STANDOFF OVER THE

1976
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
THE WHITE HOUSE JUST MOMENTS AGO

1977
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
REJECTING SPEAKER BOEHNER'S

1978
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
BACK-UP PROPOSAL SAYING IT

1979
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
DOESN'T PUT ENOUGH OF A TAX

1980
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
BURDEN ON THE WEALTHIEST

1981
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
AMERICANS.

1982
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
THE BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND

1983
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
FORTH AND HERE WE GO AGAIN.

1984
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT

1985
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
CARL CAMERON IS LIVE ON CAPITOL

1986
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
HILL.
SO, CARL, WHAT IS EXACTLY

1987
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
HAPPENING OVER THERE?

1988
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
>> Reporter: WELL, MR. BOEHNER

1989
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
HAS COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE

1990
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
PROPOSAL, AND THEY ARE

1991
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
ESSENTIALLY WORRIED THAT THE

1992
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
FISCAL CLIFF -- WHICH IS A

1993
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
TWO-PART THING, MASSIVE, MASSIVE

1994
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
SPENDING CUTS AND HUGE TAX

1995
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
INCREASES.

1996
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
IF THE PRESIDENT WON'T COME TO

1997
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND REDUCE

1998
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
SPENDING MORE AGGRESSIVELY,

1999
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
MR. BOEHNER SAYS THEY WILL

2000
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE, BUT THERE

2001
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
NEEDS TO BE A SO-CALLED PLAN B

2002
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
IN WHICH REPUBLICANS ARE

2003
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
OFFERING TO DEAL WITH TAX CUTS

2004
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
AND RAISE THEM ONLY ON INCOMES

2005
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

2006
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
CURRENT 35% TO THE CLINTON ERA

2007
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
39.6%.

2008
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
SPENDING VERSUS TAX CUTS, AND

2009
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE WHAT

2010
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
THEY'RE HEARING, SO THEY NEED A

2011
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
PLAN B.

2012
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
LISTEN.
>> SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT

2013
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK

2014
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING

2015
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
TO ALSO MOVE PLAN B.

2016
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY

2017
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
INCOME TAX FILER IN AMERICA IS

2018
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
GOING TO PAY HIGHER RATES COME

2019
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
JANUARY THE 1ST UNLESS CONGRESS

2020
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
ACTS.

2021
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
>> WE LOOK TO FIND THE ANSWER TO

2022
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
SOLVE THE PROBLEM ON THE

2023
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
SPENDING ISSUE HERE IN

2024
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
WASHINGTON.

2025
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT YET THERE,

2026
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
HE HAS NOT COME TO WHERE HE

2027
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER FOR US TO

2028
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
PUSH THROUGH A BILL THAT REALLY

2029
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
DOES BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE

2030
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
PROBLEM.

2031
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
AND CAN AS THE SPEAKER SAID --

2032
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
AND AS THE SPEAKER SAID, THAT'S

2033
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
WHY WE ARE NOW DISCUSSING AN

2034
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
ALTERNATIVE PLAN IF THE

2035
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE

2036
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
CANNOT COME OUR WAY.

2037

2100
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000

REJOICING THAT THE REPUBLICANS

2102
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000

SO THE BIG THING, THE BOTTOM

2111
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000

2112
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000

THIS IS SAD STORY.

2542
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
HE WAS VERY OPEN.

2543
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
DECLARED THE GUN ON U.S.

2544
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
SIDE AND WENT IN THERE.

2545
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

2546
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
MORE PRUDENT AND DONE THE

2547
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
SAME SORT OF THING WITH THE

2548
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
MEXICAN EMBASSY HERE BUT AS

2549
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
FAR AS GETTING HIM OUT, THE

2550
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
WAY IT WORKS THERE DECIDEDLY

2551
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
DIFFERENT THAN IN THE U.S.

2552
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
INITIALLY THEY WILL LOOK AT

2553
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
THE EVIDENCE AND IF THE

2554
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
POLICE THINK'S THERE'S A

2555
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
SUFFICIENT BASIS TO CHARGE

2556
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
THEY WILL.

2557
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
HE IS THEN BROUGHT BEFORE

2558
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
THE MINISTER WHICH HAS 48

2559
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
HOURS TO DETERMINE IF THERE

2560
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OR

2561
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
EXTEND THE TIME.

2562
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
THEREAFTER THE JUDGE HAS 72

2563
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
HOURS TO DETERMINE IF THERE

2564
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
IS SUFFICIENT CAUSE.

2565
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
NOW IT APPEARS THIS MUST

2566
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE HE HAS

2567
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
BEEN IN FOR THAT PERIOD OF

2568
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000

2569

FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS.

2570
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
HE DOES HAVE ALTERNATIVES.

2571
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
THERE IS CERTAIN PROPERLY

2572
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
MECHANISMS IN MEXICO.

2573
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
YOU CAN FILE A EMPARO

2574
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR RIGHTS

2575
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
ARE VIOLATED.

2576
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
JENNA: SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

2577
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

2578
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
DO YOU THINK IT IS LIKELY OR

2579
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
UNLIKELY THAT HE GETS OUT OF

2580
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
PRISON IN JANUARY?

2581
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
HE COULD BE, ACCORDING TO

2582
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
THE LATEST THAT WE HAVE,

2583
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
SOME OF HIS OFFENSES COULD

2584
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
BE PUNISHABLE UP TO 15 YEARS

2585
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
IN PRISON.

2586
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
DO YOU THINK THAT IS LIKELY,

2587
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
THAT HE STAYS IN PRISON

2588
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
LONGER THAN THE TIME HE

2589
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
ALREADY HAS SPENT?

2590
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
>> I WOULDN'T WANT TO

2591
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
PREJUDGE THE CASE BUT THERE

2592
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
IS ENOUGH MITIGATING FACTS

2593
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
HERE I THINK IN THE END, YOU

2594
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
KNOW, FAIRNESS WILL PREVAIL.

2595
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
AND I THINK, WHILE HE IS

2596
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
CHARGED WITH THE MOST

2597
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
SERIOUS, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT

2598
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
HAS TO STAY THERE.

2599
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONFLICT

2600
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
IN TYPES OF CHARGES.
HE IS CHARGED WITH AN

2601
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
AGGRAVATED FELONY FOR BEING

2602
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
IN POSSESSION OF A WEAPON

2603
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
THAT THE MILITARY USES.

2604
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
ON THE OTHER HAND IT APPEARS

2605
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
THERE ARE STATUTES IN PLACE

2606
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
THAT PERMIT THE POSSESSION

2607
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
AS LONG AS IT IS NOT SHORTER

2608
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
THAN 20 INCHES.

2609
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
WE UNDERSTAND HIS GUN IS AT

2610
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
LEAST 24.

2611
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
JENNA: AS HE POINTS OUT,

2612
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
VERY CONFUSING EVEN SOME

2613
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
DETAILS WE HAVE WHAT EXACTLY

2614
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
HE IS BEING HELD ON.

2615
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
>> RIGHT.
JENNA: WHAT OTHER KIND OF

2616
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
DETAILS TO THIS CASE HIS

2617
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
PARENTS, AS WELL AS THE

2618
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS WITH HIM,

2619
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
WHO WAS ARRESTED AS WELL BUT

2620
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
NOT KEPT IN PRISON BECAUSE

2621
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
IT WASN'T HIS GUN, SAY WHEN

2622
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
THEY TALKED TO THE U.S.

2623
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
AGENTS THEY TOLD HIM, GO

2624
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
AHEAD, YOU'LL BE FINE.

2625
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
>> YOU'LL BE FINE.

2626
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
THE BARREL OF THE SHOTGUN IS

2627
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
24 INCHES.

2628
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
UNDER, FORGET ABOUT THE U.S.

2629
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
CONSTITUTION I AGREE IT DOES

2630
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
NOT APPLY IN MEXICO

2631
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
OBVIOUSLY BUT, 24 INCH

2632
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
BARREL, RIGHT.
WHAT THEY PROSECUTE IN

2633
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
MEXICO FOR THE MOST HEINOUS

2634
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
CRIMES ARE 20 INCHES AND

2635
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
BELOW.

2636
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
WHY WOULD MEXICO BE GOING

2637
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
OUT OF ITS WAY TO PROSECUTE

2638
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
THIS YOUNG MAN, KEEP HIM IN

2639
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
PRISON FOR UP TO 15 YEARS,

2640
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
JENNA.

2641
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

2642
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I WILL TELL YOU THE PARENT

2643
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
HAVE GONE ON THE RECORD SAID

2644
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE GUN.

2645
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
IT IS ABOUT EXTORTION FROM

2646
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
THE PARENTS.

2647
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
PARENTS ALLEGING THEY HAVE

2648
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
BEEN CALLED AND SAID YOU PAY

2649
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
UP, YOU WIRE US MONEY OR

2650
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
ELSE.
JENNA: THIS PRISON, TED, IS

2651
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
SUPPOSEDLY RUN BY ONE OF THE

2652
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
BIGGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS

2653
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
CARTELS IN THE AREA THE

2654
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
PARENTS HAVE SAID THIS.

2655
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
WHAT LISA SAID ABOUT

2656
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
EXTORTION, HOW DO YOU KEEP A

2657
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
CLIENT LIKE THIS SAFE?

2658
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE

2659
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES WHEN

2660
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
REPRESENTING AN AMERICAN IN

2661
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

2662
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO

2663
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
PROTECT AND TRY TO PREVAIL

2664
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
IN THE CASE YOU HAVE TO BE

2665
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
CONCERNED WITH THEIR VERY

2666
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
SURVIVAL.

2667
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL BE

2668
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN

2669
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
VIOLATIONS, WILL BE ABLE TO

2670
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
WEIGH ON THOSE TYPES OF

2671
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
ISSUES BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE

2672
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
TO WEIGH IN AS AN ADVOCATE.

2673
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
AND I THINK THE PARENT AS

2674
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO

2675
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
REMAIN PERSUASIVE AND NOT

2676
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
INSULTING AND RAISE THIS

2677
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
ISSUE TO THE PUBLIC I THINK

2678
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
IT'S PROBABLY A WORTHWHILE

2679
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
WAY TO ADVANCE HIS CAUSE.

2680
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
AGAIN, ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL

2681
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
WHEN DEALING WITH THE MEDIA

2682
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
IN THESE SORTS OF THINGS.

2683
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
THIS IS THE KIND OF CASE

2684
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
THAT SHOULD WORK ITSELF OUT

2685
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
WITH THE PROPER

2686
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
DOCUMENTATION.
>> CAN'T THE AMERICAN

2687
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
EMBASSY THOUGH, YOU'RE

2688
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
SAYING THEY SHOULD STAY OUT

2689
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
OF IT PRETTY MUCH I DON'T

2690
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
THINK THAT IS CORRECT

2691
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN EMBASSY

2692
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
CAN SAY TO THE MEXICO

2693
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
GOVERNMENT, THE PROSECUTION,

2694
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
HEY, ABIDE BY YOUR OWN

2695
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
GUIDELINES.
YOU DON'T PROSECUTE FOR THE

2696
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
15 YEAR PENALTY UNLESS 20

2697
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
INCHES AND BELOW.

2698
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
JENNA: TED WHAT ABOUT THAT?

2699
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
WHAT IS THE RISK I GUESS,

2700
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
THE POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT?

2701
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
>> SURE, SURE.
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE

2702
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
DANCE THAT GOES ON AND

2703
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
REALLY VARIES FROM CASE TO

2704
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
CASE.

2705
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
ON THE ONE HAND THE AMERICAN

2706
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
GOVERNMENT WILL BE THE FIRST

2707
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
TO SAY THEY ANT BE YOUR

2708
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
ADVOCATE AND CAN'T GET YOUR

2709
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
RELEASE.
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE

2710
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS THAT CAN

2711
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
BE EMPLOYED, HOSTEN EMPLOYED

2712
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
PUBLICLY AND NOT SO

2713
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
PUBLICLY.
THAT IS THE ART OF DEALING

2714
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
WITH THESE SORTS OF CASES.

2715
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL WHAT

2716
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
THEY'RE SAYING PUBLICLY TO

2717
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
INSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE

2718
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
RESULT.
I BELIEVE IN THE END THIS IS

2719
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
THE SORT OF CASE IF PROPERLY

2720
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
HANDLED WILL RESOLVE ITSELF

2721
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
AND HE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO ST.

2722
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
IT'S CLEAR HE HAD NO BAD

2723
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
INTENT.

2724
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
HE DECLARED IT ON THE U.S.

2725
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
SIDE.

2726
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
HE DECLARED IT ON THE

2727
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
MEXICAN SIDE.

2728
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
BUT FOR NOT HAVING THE

2729
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
PROPER PERMIT THIS WOULD IN

2730
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
THE HAVE HAPPENED.

2731
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
AGAIN IT'S A REMINDER FOR

2732
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
EVERYONE LISTENING IF YOU'RE

2733
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
GOING TO TRAVEL TO A FOREIGN

2734
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
COUNTRY, CONSIDER WHAT

2735
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING

2736
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
THERE, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

2737
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
BE BRINGING WHAT YOU'RE

2738
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
GOING TO ACQUIRE AND WHAT

2739
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
YOU WILL BRING BACK.

2740
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
JENNA: GOOD ADVICE FOR

2741
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
SOMEONE WHO REPRESENT AD FEW

2742
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
HIGH-PROFILE CASES OVERSEAS.

2743
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
LIS, QUICK FINAL THOUGHT.

2744
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
>> BOTTOM LINE HE SHOULD

2745
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
HAVE HAD A SMALL FINE AND

2746
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
BEEN RELEASED.

2747
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
CRAZY HE IS IN PRISON FOUR

2748
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000

KEY TO MAKING IT WORK IS

THOUGHT HE WOULD WIN THE

ATTENTION OF JODIE FOSTER,

3051
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
THE ACTRESS BY DOING THAT.

3052
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
ARE THE MEDIA PART OF THE

3053
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
PROBLEM HERE?
>> WELL, I MEAN I'M NOT AN

3054
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
EXPERT BUT AS YOU MENTIONED

3055
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL

PRESUMABLY ARE EXPERTS, THEY

3058
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
SAID EXACTLY THIS.

3059
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
THEY SAID THAT THIS IS A

3060
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
MEDIA COPYCATTING SITUATION

3061
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
AND THEY PLEADED TO NOT

3062
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
PUBLICIZE THE SITUATION AT

3063
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
LEAST OF THE KILLER IN

3064
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
VIRGINIA TECH BACK IN 2007.

3065
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
AND FRANKLY THAT ADVICE OR

3066
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
THAT SUGGESTION WASN'T EVEN

3067
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
HEEDED.

3068
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
IT WAS SO BADLY HEEDED IN

3069
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
FACT THAT THE MEDIA NOT ONLY

3070
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
IDENTIFIED THE KILLER, THEY

3071
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
IDENTIFIED THE WRONG KILLER.

3072
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
THEY GOT THE KILLER'S

3073
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
BROTHER.

3074
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I CAN REMEMBER BACK IN 1999,

3075
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
IN THE COLUMBINE CASE, JON,

3076
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
YOU AND I, ALL THREE OF US

3077
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
WERE AT FOX AT THE TIME,

3078
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT

3079
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
SAID DON'T MENTION THE NAMES

3080
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
OF THE KILLERS.

3081
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
YOU DIDN'T, SHOWED THEIR

3082
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
PICTURES, NOT THEIR NAMES.

3083
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
DON'T GIVE THEM CREDIT.

3084
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
THAT WAS A GOOD POINT.

3085
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
A LOT OF US TRIED TO ADHERE

3086
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
TO THAT.

3087
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
COMPLETELY LOST IN THIS CASE.

3088
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
WE BETTER GET IT BACK.

3089
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
JON: ALAN, WHAT IS YOUR

3090
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
FEELING?
IS THE MEDIA A PART OF THIS

3091
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
CRIMES?
>> IT IS HARD TO SAY.

3092
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
JIM MAKES VERY GOOD POINTS

3093
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
WHETHER PUBLICITY COULD

3094
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
INSPIRE SOMEBODY TO DO SOME

3095
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
HEINOUS ACT.

3096
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
ON THE OTHER HAND WE LIVE IN

3097
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
AN OPEN SOCIETY WITH A MEDIA

3098
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO REPORT

3099
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
THE NEWS.

3100
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE MEDIA

3101
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
CAN DO ITS JOB UNLESS THE

3102
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
MEDIA IS GIVEN THE FREEDOM

3103
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
TO EXPRESS ITSELF AND GIVE

3104
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
THE FULL STORY.

3105
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I THINK THERE'S ALSO A

3106
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
FASCINATION TO WANT TO KNOW

3107
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

3108
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
COMMIT THESE HEINOUS CRIMES.

3109
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?

3110
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
WHAT INSPIRES THEM TO DO IT?

3111
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
WHAT MOTIVATES THEM?

3112
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
WHAT IS THE MIND LIKE.

3113
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
IT GIVES US A ROUNDER

3114
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
PICTURE.

3115
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO IT IS

3116
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
AND WHAT THEY ARE THINKING

3117
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
AND WHAT ISSUES MAY GO INTO

3118
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
THEM COMMITTING THESE

3119
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
TRAGEDIES, WE CAN THEN

3120
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
ADDRESS THEM MORE FULLY.

3121
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
SO I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER

3122
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
SIDE TO THIS AS WELL THAT

3123
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
WOULD INDICATE WE LIVE IN A

3124
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
SOCIETY WHERE WE GET FULL

3125
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
INFORMATION.

3126
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
TRANSPARENCY IS VERY

3127
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
IMPORTANT IN OUR SOCIETY.

3128
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO

3129
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
AVOID THAT.
JON: EARLIER THIS YEAR I WAS

3130
