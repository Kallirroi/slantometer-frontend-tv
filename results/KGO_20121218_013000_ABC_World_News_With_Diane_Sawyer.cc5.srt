SOME VERY POOR CHOICES AND THAT

194
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
IS RARE.

EVERYTHING.

240
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SO, YOU KNOW, I KNEW HE WAS ON

249
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SECONDS.

250
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HE'D ALWAYS LOOK DOWN AT HIS

251
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PAPER, WHATEVER HE WAS DOING.

252
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000

OR TURN YOUR BACK ON HIM AT ANY

258
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000

CLOSE TO ADAM WHEN HE WAS IN THE

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
HAD SEVERAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING

264
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THE INABILITY TO FEEL PAIN.

265
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
>> SO, IF HE HAD CUT HIMSELF OR

266
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HURT HIMSELF, HE WOULD NOT KNOW

267
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
IT OR FEEL IT.

268
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000

CAREFUL WITH HIM.

FROM A GUNSHOT WOUND.

297
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AND CONSIDER THIS.

298
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
AMERICANS ARE 20 TIMES MORE

299
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000

300
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000

SO MOVING IS EASIER.

417

CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH
OR WITHOUT FOOD.

418
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

419
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR

THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

426
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

428
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000

FOR LONG PERIODS.

NSAIDS, INCLUDING CELEBREX,

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS

OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

432

SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

433
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000

AND THE ELDERLY

435
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR
STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
DO NOT TAKE CELEBREX IF YOU'VE
HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,

437

BUT DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THEM

724
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WERE TEACHING US ABOUT STRENGTH.

725
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A GIFT OF WISDOM, NOW, FROM

726
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
TEACHERS, GRIEVING PARENTS AND

727
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
CHILDREN, AS THE PRESIDENT SAID,

728
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
INSPIRING US TO LOOK FOR THE SUN

729
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
TO RISE EVERY DAY.

730
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

731
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
TEACHERS WHO KEPT STEADY THROUGH

732
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
IT ALL.

733
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
AND REASSURED THEIR STUDENTS BY

734
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SAYING, "WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

735
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THEY'RE COMING."

736
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
>> I JUST SAID, WE HAVE TO BE

737
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

738
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I SAID, THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT

739
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THERE NOW, WE NEED TO WAIT FOR

740
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THE GOOD GUYS.

741
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
>> SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

742
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
>> IF THEY STARTED CRYING, I

743
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WOULD, LIKE, TAKE THEIR FACE AND

744
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SAY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SHOW

745
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000

746
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> THE SCHOOL'S STAFF DID NOT
FLINCH.

747
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THEY DID NOT HESITATE.
>> SO, I SAID TO THEM, I SAID, I

748
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

749
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ALL VERY MUCH.

750
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

751
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

752
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
LAST THING THEY WERE EVER GOING

753
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TO HEAR.
>> GIVING THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT

754
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE.

755
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000

STUDENTS AND HUDDLED THEM INTO A

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
CLOSET AND THEN SHIELDED THE

759
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
CHILDREN IN THE CLOSET.

760
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE LOST HER

761
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
LIFE, BUT KNOWING THE WAY SHE

762
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
LOST IT, WE'RE PROUD TO CALL HER

763
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
FAMILY AND THAT SHE WAS A HERO,

764
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE
CHILDREN.

765
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
>> AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE
INSPIRED US, NEWTOWN.

766
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
YOU'VE LOOKED OUT FOR EACH

767

REMEMBERED.

772
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
>> OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

773
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
OUT TO THEM.

774
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

775
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000

LIFE.

780
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
AND WAS GOING TO GET COWGIRL

BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS, ISN'T
COMING HOPE.

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I FOUND A LITTLE JOURNAL, I

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED,

785

787
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
