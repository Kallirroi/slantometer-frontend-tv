YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
IT REALLY DOES NOT FEEL
LIKE CHRISTMAS

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TILL THE TREE IS UP!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
HA HA! LOOK AT THAT.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
YOU KNOW THE ONE THING
IT'S MISSIN'?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND, UH, YOU SEE THIS
A LOT WITH TREES--

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
IS THE COLOR GREEN.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
OH, NOW, CASH, THAT IS
THE GREENEST TREE YOU CAN GET.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
IT'S MADE ENTIRELY
OF POST-CONSUMER RECYCLED WASTE.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
YOU MEAN LIKE SODA BOTTLES
AND PLASTIC BAGS?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
YES, EXACTLY.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
BUT MOSTLY DIAPERS.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
HEY, GUYS, GEOFFREY AND I--
HO HO!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
(door closes)

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK.
WHAT'S THAT?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THAT IS A W.P.W.--

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A WOOD-LESS PINK WONDER.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
YEAH, BUT, MAMA, I WANTED
THE SMELL OF REAL PINE,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
LIKE A TRADITIONAL
CHRISTMAS TREE.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
OH, HONEY, CHANGE IS GOOD.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
A GIRL ON THE FARM,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
MY FAVORITE TRADITION
WAS WHEN UNCLE CHARLES

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
CUT OFF THE GOOSE'S HEAD.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
AND THEN WHOMEVER
THE HEADLESS TORSO RAN TO

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
GOT TO PUT THE STAR
ON THE TREE.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK
TO THAT?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
NO.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
IT'S JUST THAT
THAT TREE'S A LITTLE MUCH.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
IT'S A LITTLE MUCH FOR ME,
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M... LATIN.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
COME ON, GUYS.
REBA, REBA, TELL 'EM.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OH. OKAY.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS
OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SINCE WE MOVED TO MALIBU.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
AY, BORING. COME ON. GET TO
THE MEAT. GET TO THE MEAT.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I WENT DOWN TO THE CHURCH,

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
AND YOU KNOW HOW I ALWAYS DID
THE CHRISTMAS SOLO BACK HOME.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
WELL, IT TURNS OUT--
OKAY, YOUR MOM

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
IS GONNA BE SINGING A SOLO
CHRISTMAS EVE AT CHURCH.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
REBA, TELL 'EM.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WELL, I HOPE I GET TO.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I STILL HAVE TO AUDITION
AFTER CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
AY, PLEASE. WITH YOUR VOICE,
THAT IS JUST A FORMALITY.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS
GONNA BE HUGE FOR HER CAREER.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
THE FIRST CHURCH OF MALIBU
IS RED-HOT.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
IT IS LISTED AS ONE
OF THE TOP TEN POWER CHURCHES.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
YEAH.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000

ARE THE WHO'S WHO OF HOLLYWOOD.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000

I'M DOING IT.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
AY, I KNOW.
IT'S FOR THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000

A HUGE SUPERSTAR SINGING CAREER,

EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T
EXPECTING IT,

583
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
THIS HAS TURNED OUT
TO BE PRETTY COOL.

584
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF Y'ALL--

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000

WHERE HOPEFUL ENTREPRENEURS

606
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
DREAM OF A CHANCE
TO SECURE AN INVESTMENT

607
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
AND GAIN POWERFUL PARTNERS

THEIR BUSINESSES.

IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA,

613
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
THEY'RE READY TO INVEST
USING THEIR OWN MONEY.

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
SO GREEDY ON THIS ONE.

615
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
AND THEY'LL FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION.

616
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
IGNORE EVERYTHING
THEY JUST SAID.

617
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
DID YOU REALLY
JUST SAY THAT?

618
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
BUT FIRST THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST CONVINCE A SHARK

619
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
TO INVEST THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR
