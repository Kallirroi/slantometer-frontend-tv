SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TRAVELING
JUST OUTSIDE OF SAN ANTONIO.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
AND DO YOU GUYS REALIZE
THAT SAN ANTONIO IS KNOWN
AS "MILITARY CITY, U.S.A."?

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WOW.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000

TO SURPRISE THE HARRIS FAMILY.

YAY!
YAY!

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
MY LITTLE BROTHER
IS KIND OF CRAZY.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
HE LIKES TO JUMP.
HE LIKES TRACTORS.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
MY FAVORITE THING IS RIDING

Shilo: WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
A LITTLE OVER 10 YEARS NOW.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SHE BECAME THE PERSON THAT
TOOK CARE OF THIS ENTIRE FAMILY

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
AFTER 9/11, I FELT LIKE
IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO MY PART,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
SO I JOINED
THE UNITED STATES ARMY.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I THOUGHT I HAD A PRETTY GOOD
IDEA OF WHAT THE WORLD WAS,

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
BUT WHEN WE CROSSED IN TO IRAQ,
IT WAS AN EYE-OPENER.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
ON THIS ROUTINE DAY,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
WE WERE CALLED TO INVESTIGATE
A POSSIBLE I.E.D.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
EN ROUTE TO THAT I.E.D.,

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
MY VEHICLE WAS HIT WITH
ABOUT 200 POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
BY A BOMB IN THE ROAD.

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I REMEMBER WAKING UP
IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT,

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
AND I'M TRYING TO OPEN UP
THE DOOR,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND I LOOK AT THIS ARM, AND
MY UNIFORM WAS MELTED TO MY ARM.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I KNEW
MY BELL HAD BEEN RUNG,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
HOW INJURED I WAS.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AS SOON
AS I ANSWERED THE PHONE

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
AND THE GENTLEMAN
INTRODUCED HIMSELF

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
AS THE REAR DETACHMENT
COMMANDER,

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I KNEW THAT WHATEVER
WAS TO FOLLOW THAT

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WAS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE AND
THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY FOREVER.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WE WEREN'T REAL SURE WE'D
GET HIM BACK TO THE STATES,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SO HIS MOM AND DAD AND I FLEW
TO LANDSTUHL IN GERMANY.

AND WONDERING IF HE WOULD

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
HOW MANY SURGERIES I'VE HAD.

IT'S AROUND 50.

THEY'RE WANTING TO FIX THE NOSE
A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
BECAUSE I HAVE A HARD TIME

I GET ENOUGH AIR.

59

THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT
TRYING TO FIX THESE FINGERS

SO, THIS HALLOWEEN,

I HAD A WIG
LIKE THE SPOCK HAIRCUT

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AND HAD A "STAR TREK" SHIRT.

TO DO IT AGAIN,

Evan: ONE OF THE UNIQUE ASPECTS
OF BEING A BURN SURVIVOR

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
IS THAT YOUR SKIN
HAS BEEN MARKEDLY CHANGED

HAS GIVEN TO HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS

NOT ONLY CAN WE BUILD
A NEW HOME FOR THIS FAMILY,

BUT WE CAN REALLY HONOR
A LOT OF THOSE OTHER SOLDIERS,

YOU WERE IN IN LANDSTUHL.

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
GUYS, GET ON BOARD!

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Ty: SHILO HAS A GREAT SENSE
OF HUMOR, BUT HE'S LOST A LOT.

501
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
HE'S STILL IN A LOT OF PAIN.

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
SO, THIS WEEK REALLY IS ABOUT

503
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
TRYING TO GET HIM
IN A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT,

504
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
WHERE HE CAN NOT ONLY BE A
SOLDIER WHO'S FINALLY COME HOME,

505
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
BUT HE CAN FINALLY BE A DAD

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
AND BE ABLE TO, LIKE,
HANG OUT WITH HIS FAMILY

507
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
IN AN ENVIRONMENT
THAT'S NOT GONNA HARM HIM.

508
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE!
LET'S GET THIS HOUSE STARTED!

509

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

510
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SO, IF YOU GUYS WILL
HELP ME, I KNOW YOU
GUYS ARE BOTH MILITARY.

511
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
ARMY, RIGHT?

512
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
SO, WE DEFINITELY WANT
TO SAVE THIS FLAG,

513
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
'CAUSE I KNOW
IT MEANS A LOT TO SHILO.

514
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ty: SHILO HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH
FOR OUR COUNTRY,

515
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
AND IF HE COULD,
HE'D GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN,

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
AND THAT'S
WHAT THIS WEEK IS ABOUT.

517
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
IT'S ABOUT HONORING HIM,

518
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT
FOLLOWING IN HIS MISSION,

519
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
WHICH IS GIVING BACK TO SO MANY
OTHER WOUNDED WARRIORS.

520
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
YO, DESIGN TEAM!
WHAT IS UP?

521
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
SO, HERE'S THE THING --
SHILO NEEDS A HOME

522
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THAT'S GOT STATE-OF-THE-ART
AIR FILTRATION,

523
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
TEMPERATURE CONTROL, INSULATION,

524
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
AND THIS HOUSE
JUST ISN'T CUTTING IT.

525
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
RIGHT.
SO, I GOT AN IDEA.

526
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
INSTEAD OF DEMOLISHING
THIS HOUSE,

527
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I KNOW THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION
HERE IN TEXAS --

528
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
THEY TRY AND RAISE MONEY
SO THEY CAN BUILD

529
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
A.D.A.-ACCESSIBLE HOMES FOR
SOLDIERS THAT REALLY NEED THEM.

530
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
SO, I FIGURE, WHY DON'T WE
TRY AND SELL THIS HOUSE,

531
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
GET AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN,
GIVE IT TO THAT ORGANIZATION

532
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP
OTHER SOLDIERS?

533
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
INSTEAD OF SELLING THE HOUSE,
WHY DON'T WE HAVE AN AUCTION?

534
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I LIKE THAT. PRICE IS GONNA
GO UP WITH AN AUCTION.

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'LL LET THE FAMILY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

536
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
OUR HELICOPTER RIDE WAS AWESOME.

537
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THEY DIDN'T FLY US
ALL THE WAY TO HEIDELBERG,

538
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
BUT I LOVED
BEING ABLE TO GO TO GERMANY.

EVERYBODY HAD SO MUCH FUN.

AND LIFE -- THEY WERE GONE.

I'M RIDING A MONKEY!

543
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
JUST TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A BLAST
WAS REALLY FUN FOR THE FAMILY.

HAVE A GOOD TIME,

GET TO DO THIS.

AND THE DUST OUT HERE,

JUST WASN'T WORKING FOR YOU.

WELL, IT'S TIME FOR IT TO GO.

WE'VE DECIDED TO SAVE IT.

WE'RE GONNA AUCTION IT OFF,

ARE GONNA GO TOWARD

WITH THAT, SO I RANG UP SANTA,

HAVE TO PUT SOME TIRES ON IT.

THIS IS A DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER,

A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

AND THEN I FRACTURED

I'VE FOUND MY NEW LOVE --

ABOUT $100,000 IN CASH.

TO SEE WHERE SHILO
DID HIS RECOVERY

804
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
AND THEN ALSO TALK
TO OTHER WOUNDED WARRIORS

805
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THAT MAYBE ARE GOING THROUGH
THE SAME THING THAT SHILO DID.

806
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
HOW DID YOU SUSTAIN
YOUR INJURY?

807
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
12 JULY, 2010.
WE WERE IN AFGHANISTAN.

808
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I MUST HAVE JUST STEPPED
MAYBE A HALF FOOT OFF THE TRAIL,

809
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
AND I JUST WENT FOR A RIDE.

810
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
WOW. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
STAYING AT RIGHT NOW?

811
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
OFF-POST HOUSING.

812
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
TRYING TO FIND A HOME
THAT IS HANDICAPPED-ACCESSIBLE

813
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
IS PRETTY DIFFICULT.
RIGHT.

814
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Xzibit: IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD
FOR KYLE AND HIS WIFE, ALICIA,

815
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION
BACK INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.

816
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'M A SERGEANT IN THE ARMY,
AND I WAS CLEARING A COMPOUND,

817
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
AND THERE WAS A GUY WATCHING US,
AND HE SET THE I.E.D. OFF ON ME.

818
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THAT IS CRAZY.

819
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
YEAH.
IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE.

820
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
AND HOW DID YOU END UP
HERE IN SAN ANTONIO?

821
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
MY DAD IS IN COLORADO,
AND MY FIANCé IS IN TEXAS.

822
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
MY MOM'S IN GEORGIA, SO TEXAS
