00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THERE ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS

ABOUT FRIDAY'S SHOOTING AT SANDY

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
LIKE THIS TO BE MASSIVE.

617
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
IT'S LIKE A BIG PUZZLE.

618
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
WE HAVE TO PUT PIECES TOGETHER

619
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
TO DRAW A PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
WHY THIS OCCURRED.

621
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000

CLASSROOM APPARENTLY BY HIS OWN

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
HAND.
A FORMER CLASSMATE WHO KNEW

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
LANZA DURING GRAMMAR SCHOOL

632
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SAY

635
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
YOU COULD PREDICT THIS.

636
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
>> MOURNERS AT THE U.S. CAPITAL

637
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
FRIDAY NIGHT AT A VIGIL.

638
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
NOWHERE IS THE SADNESS MORE

>> REALLY STRUGGLE TO FIND THE

642
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
WORDS AS TO WHAT HAPPENED.

643
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
>> EVEN AN EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT

644
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
OBAMA HAD TO FIGHT BACK TEARS.

645
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
>> THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I

646
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

647
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG

648
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER,

649
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
AND WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE

650
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
LOVE THEM AND WE WILL REMIND

651
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
EACH OTHER HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE

652
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
ONE ANOTHER.

653
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

654
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

655
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
TONIGHT.
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

FORMER COLLEAGUES SAY SHE WAS

661
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
KNOWN FOR HER PLAYFUL PASSION.

662
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
JUST A MONTH AGO SHE DRESSED UP

663
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000

LEAVING ONLY ONE WOUNDED

678
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
SURVIVOR AT THE SCHOOL.

679
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HE THEN SHOT

680
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000

RIFLE AND WE ARE JUST NOW

685
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000

WEREN'T REGISTERED TO LANZA'S

688
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
MOTHER.

689
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
A SCHOOL BUS DRIVER WHO KNEW

690
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
LANZA SAID IT WAS TOTALLY

691
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
UNEXPECTED.
>> THEY ARE NICE KIDS.

692
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
POLITE.
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO ME.

693
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK

694
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

695
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT HE DID.

696
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
>>> WHEN ONE TEACHER HEARD GUN

697
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
FIRE SHE RACED TO HERD HER 15

698
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
STUDENTS INTO A TINY BATHROOM.

699
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
A QUICK THINKING FRANTIC EFFORT

700
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
TO SAVE THEIR YOUNG LIVES.

701
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
LISTEN AS SHE DESCRIBES WHAT

702
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
HAPPENED.
>> ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON TOP OF

703
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THE TOILET.
I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN THERE

704
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
AND TELLING THEM IT'S GOING TO

705
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
BE OKAY.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

706
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I HAD PULLED THE BOOK SHELF

707
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR IN

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
FRONT OF IT.
WE WERE COMPLETELY BARRICADED

709
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
IN.
I TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF.

710
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I WAS AFRAID IF HE CAME IN HE

711
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WOULD HEAR US HE WOULD START

712
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SHOOTING THE DOOR.

713
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I SAID WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY

714
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
QUIET.

715
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I SAID THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT

716
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THERE NOW AND WE NEED TO WAIT

717
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

718
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I AM HEARING THE GUN FIRE IN THE

719
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
HALLWAY.

720
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I AM THINKING IN MY MIND I AM

721
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THE FIRST CLASSROOM.

722
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WHY ISN'T HE COMING.

723
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I AM THINKING AS A 6-YEAR-OLD,

724
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
7-YEAR-OLD WHAT ARE YOUR

725
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THOUGHTS, WHAT ARE YOUR -- I AM

726
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THINKING THAT I HAVE TO ALMOST

727
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
BE THE PARENT, LIKE I HAVE TO

728
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TELL THEM, YOU KNOW -- I SAID TO

729
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THEM, I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
LOVE YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

731
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
AND THAT IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

732
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LAST THING

733
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
THEY WERE EVER GOING TO HEAR.

734
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

735
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
DIE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
OKAY -- TEACHERS AND -- I WANTED

737
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEM TO KNOW SOMEONE LOVES THEM

738
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
AND I WANTED THAT TO BE ONE OF

739
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
