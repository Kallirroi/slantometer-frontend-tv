7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hurry in for a Droid Razr M

8

by Motorola for $49.99.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID WE CAN'T

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
HE SAID WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
ANYMORE.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END, AND TO
SEE THEM END WE MUST CHANGE.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
HE SPOKE ABOUT LAWS.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
HE SAID NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
LAWS WILL ELIMINATE EVIL FROM

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THE WORLD BUT IF YOU CAN ACT TO

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
SAVE ONE LIFE TO PREVENT ONE

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
MORE ATTACK LIKE THIS, THAT'S

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SOMETHING THE NATION MUST

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ENGAGE.
SO HE IS SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THAT WANTS TO RECEIVE THE

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
MESSAGE, AND AN AUDIENCE OF

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
PEOPLE NOT JUST IN THE TOWN OF

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
NEWTOWN BUT ALL ACROSS THE

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
NATION THAT ARE HURTING.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
>>Judge Jeanine:  I WAS THERE

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
LAST NIGHT, AND I HAVE TO TELL

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
YOU, WATCHING PEOPLE DOING KIND

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OF MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS AND

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
LIGHTING CANDLES, IT WAS

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
PALPABLE.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
YOU COULD FEEL THE PAIN AND

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
AGONY IN THAT TOWN.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
TODAY NOW THAT WE'RE FINALLY

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
DOING VIGILS AND PRAYER

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
SERVICES, AND TOMORROW THE FIRST

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
CHILD WILL BE BURIED.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> YEAH.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
AND THE ONLY WORD YOU CAN COME

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
UP WITH IS THAT IT'S SO SAD.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THE PEOPLE ARE BUILDING THE

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
MEMORIAL.
THEY'RE WEARING RIBBONS,

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
BRINGING THE TOYS.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THEY CREATED A LITTLE MEMORIAL

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
OF ANGELS, ONE REPRESENTING EACH

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OF THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
IN THIS ACT.
BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CAN DO.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
NO ONE REALLY BELIEVES THEY CAN

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
DO ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE THE

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SITUATION RIGHT.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AS

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OPPOSED TO NOTHING.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HURTING SO

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
BADLY, AND NO ONE HAS THE

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ABILITY TO MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
SIMPLY IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SENSE AT ALL, JUDGE.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>> MIKE TOBIN, THANKS SO MUCH.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
VICTIMS?

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000

A HUGE, HUGE GIANTS FAN.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THE FIRST-GRADER LOVED SPORTS

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000

THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT IS THE

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
FACT IT APPEARS THERE'S A LOT

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
GOING ON IN SOCIAL MEDIA, AND

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
YOU WERE VERY CLEAR AT YOUR LAST

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
PRESS CONFERENCE THERE WILL BE

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SAYING

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THE CASE OR ARE POSING AS PEOPLE

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
WHO EITHER WERE PART OF THE

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SHOOTING OR PART OF THE --

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THREATENING INDIVIDUALS IN THIS

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
CASE.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
>> IT'S VERY CLEAR, AS YOU HAVE

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BEEN REPORTING AND SPEAKING

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
ABOUT, A VERY COMPLEX

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
INVESTIGATION.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
INVESTIGATION.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
INNUENDO AND INCORRECT

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
INFORMATION THAT'S BEING PUT OUT

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THERE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE POSING

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AS OFFICIALS, WHO ARE POSING AS

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE NOT, AND

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THEY ARE SIMPLY CAUSING

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
INTERFERENCE IN THE

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
INVESTIGATION.
WE CERTAINLY ARE FOLLOWING EVERY

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
SINGLE LEAD AND TIDBIT OF

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
INFORMATION WE UNCOVER, LEAVING

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
NO STONE UNTURNED AND THIS IS

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ACTUALLY HINDERING THE

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
INVESTIGATION.
SO I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND THEY'RE

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
RIGHT ONBOARD, AND IN FACT IF

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THERE ARE ANY -- ANYONE POSTS

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ANYTHING THAT IS INCORRECT,

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
INACCURATE OR THREATENING, THEY

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WILL BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
AND PROSECUTED THE FULLEST

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
EXTENT OF THE LAW.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
>> LIEUTENANT, YOU INDICATED
THERE WAS A FOURTH WEAPON THAT

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WAS FOUND IN THE SHOOTER'S CAR,

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THE SUSPECT'S CAR, ADAM LANZA'S

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
CAR -- I HATE SAYING HIS NAME

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
AND I'M GOING TO TRY NOT TO.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
BUT WE KNOW THAT HE TOOK THE

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
LONG GUN, THE BUSHMASTER, AS

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
WELL AS THE GLOCK AND THE SIG

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SAUE.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THE FOURTH GUN THAT YOU

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
INDICATED WAS THERE, WHAT KIND

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
OF A GUN WAS THAT?

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
>> THAT WAS A SHOTGUN THAT WAS

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
LOCATED BY INVESTIGATORS AFTER

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THE SHOOTING, INSIDE OF THE

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
SUSPECT'S CAR.

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> WE BELIEVE THAT WAS SOMETHING

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THAT HIS MOTHER -- THAT WAS

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
ANOTHER GUN THAT BELONGED TO HIS

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
MOTHER?
>> THE OWNERSHIP IS

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
UNDETERMINED.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'M NOT PRIVY TO THAT

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
INFORMATION.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SUFFICE TO SAY ALL OF THE

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WEAPONS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THOROUGHLY BY A TEAM FROM THE

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
DAY THEY WERE BUILT, UP TO THE

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
DAY WE SEIZED THEM, TRYING TO

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
DETERMINE EVERY AVENUE THOSE

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WEAPONS TOOK, WHERE THEY WERE

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
USED, WHO THEY WERE USED BY, AND

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> YOU KNOW, LIEUTENANT, NOW WE

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000

371
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I REALLY I DO BELIEVE THIS COULD

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BE POSSIBLE.

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THE MOM HAD

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
SO MANY GUNS?

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
>> I AM SHOCKED.

376
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I AM SURPRISED SHE HAD THAT MANY

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
GUNS.
CAUSED ME TO REALLY RETHINK

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
KEEPING ME UP AT NIGHT WONDERING

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
WHY I WOULD NOT HAVE ENVISIONED

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
HER NOT ONLY TO HAVE GUNS BUT

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THE TYPE OF GUNS.

382
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
>> WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

383
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
SHARING YOUR INSIGHT ON THE

384
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER.

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS

386
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
EVENING.
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE.

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> COMING UP TOMORROW MORNING

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WILL GO

389
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
BACK TO SCHOOL.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WILL THEY EVEN BE SAFE?

391
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
CAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
AGAIN?
LATER THEY SAY TIME HEALS ALL

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
WOUNDS, BUT HOW LONG WILL IT

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
TAKE TO HEAL AFTER A TRAGEDY

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
LIKE THIS.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
LOTS OF PREPAID CARDS COME
PRE-FILLED WITH PROBLEMS.

397
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
INTRODUCING CHASE LIQUID.

399
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
THE RELOADABLE CARD

400
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000

403
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
GET RID OF PREPAID PROBLEMS.

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
GET CHASE LIQUID.

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
(INAUDIBLE)

406
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> TOMORROW MORNING MILLIONS OF

407
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
CHILDREN ACROSS AMERICA HEAD

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
BACK TO SCHOOL.

409
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
THEIR PARENTS ARE NOW FORCED TO

410
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WONDER, IS MY CHILD SAFE?

411
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
WITH ME IS FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE

412
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
AND SCHOOL SAFETY EXPERT.

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US,

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
HARRY.
WE KNOW THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

415
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
SYSTEM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

416
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
PARTICULAR HAD MEASURES IN PLACE

417
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
FOR SAFETY, AND IT IS OBVIOUS TO

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
STOP THIS CRAZED INDIVIDUAL.

419
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
HE IS EVIL.

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
HE DID THE DEVIL'S WORK.

421
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
WHAT CAN WE DO IN SCHOOLS TO

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN?

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
>> THEY DID HAVE SOME PLAN IN

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THE SCHOOL.

425
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
WE COULD PROBABLY TWEAK THAT,

426
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THOUGH.
>> HOW?

427
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> APPARENTLY THE SHOOTER GOT IN

428
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR.

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS HE SHOT THE

430
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
GLASS DOOR OUT AND WENT INSIDE.

431
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THE CLASS ITSELF WASN'T -- WAS

432
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
VERY EASILY PENETRATED.

433
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THE

434
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
SCHOOL.
SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT

435
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THINGS WE CAN DO.

436
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> WHAT?

437
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
>> SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE PUT THE

438
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
BARS ON THE DOORS.

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
>> PEOPLE SAY, HARRY THAT THAT'S

440
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INTIMIDATING.
YOU DON'T WANT METAL DETECTORS

441
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
YOU DON'T WANT A COP WITH A GUN.

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
NOW YOU ARE TALKING BARS.

443
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
YOU BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING WE

444
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
NEED TO DO?

445
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
>> I THINK THAT THE LOCK DOWN IS

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
PROBABLY THE ANSWER.

447
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
>> DESCRIBE A LOCK DOWN.

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> YOU DO WITH YOUR EMERGENCY

449
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
ACTION PLAN.

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
IT IS BASICALLY LOCKING DOWN THE

451
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SCHOOL WHICH THEY TRIED TO DO.

452
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THEY LOCKED ALL OF THE DOORS.

453
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
>> BUT THE SHOOTER IS IN THE

454
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
SCHOOL.
RIGHT, EXACTLY.

455
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THE SHOOTER GOT INTO THE SCHOOL.

456
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
IF THEY HAD SOME KIND OF BARS ON

457
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT DOOR MAYBE THE SHOOTER

458
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO THE

459
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
SCHOOL.

460
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
>> SO LET'S ACCOUPLE THAT THERE

461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
IS THIS AS YOU CALL SAFETY OR

462
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN.

463
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO TRAIN

464
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THE TEACHERS AND EFSHL ELSE.

465
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
IS THIS EXPENSIVE?

466
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WHO PAYS FOR IT IN A WORLD WHERE

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THE END OF THE FISCAL CLIFF, HOW

468
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
DIFFICULT IS IT?

469
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS AREN'T

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
GOING TO PUT 50,000 DOLLARS INTO

471
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
A SECURITY UPGRADE.

472
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS EASY TO

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DO.

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
IT IS A LITTLE SCHOOLING.

475
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
YOU CAN BASICALLY GET A HANDYMAN

476
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
TO DO SOME OF THE WORK TO THE

477
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
WINDOWS AND TO THE DOORS AND YOU

478
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
WILL HAVE A HE CSECURE SCHOOL.

479
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOME

480
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
TYPE OF AN ALARM WHERE THEY KNOW

481
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
IT IS TIME FOR THE LOCK DOWN.

482
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
>> EVERYBODY HEARD WHAT WAS

483
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
GOING ON.

484
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
>> WHAT SHOULD PARENTS DO

485
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
TOMORROW MORNING SHOULD THEY

486
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
CALL THEIR SCHOOL AND SAY HEY

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WHAT IS THE SAFETY PLAN FOR MY

488
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
CHILD?

489
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THEY SHOULD

490
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
DEFINITELY DO.

491
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I SUGGEST PARENTS CALL THE

492
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SCHOOL AND ASK THEM DO YOU HAVE

493
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN

494
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
EFFECT IN THE SCHOOL?

495
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
IF NOT, WHY?

496
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
AND IF NOT, WHEN?

497
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
GET TOGETHER WITH THE PTA, THEN

498
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
YOU CAN ALL GET TOGETHER TALK

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WITH THE SCHOOL OFF FIFSH SHALLS

500
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
AND POLICE AND PUT AN EMERGENCY

501
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
ACTION PLAN TOGETHER.

502
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
LOCK DOWN IS VERY COST

503
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
EFFECTIVE.

504
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
>> WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN?

505
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

506
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
THE DRILLS THESE CHILDREN

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
BEFORE, I USE TO DO HIDE UNDER

508
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
THE DESK.

509
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
MY KIDS WILL SAY THAT'S WHERE

510
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THEY WERE WRITTEN ON THE SILK

511
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
TABLETS.

512
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TODAY THE DRILL IS WHAT?

513
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
SIMPLY TO GO OUT OF THE SCHOOL?

514
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
HOW DO YOU PREPARE LITTLE KIDS

515
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
WITHOUT SCARING THEM?

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
>> FOR AN ACTIVE SHOOTER YOU

517
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
DON'T WANT THE KIDS RUNNING OUT

518
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OF SCHOOL.

519
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
THEY CAN RUN INTO THE ACTIVE

520
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SHOOTER.
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOCK DOWN

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
THE CLASSROOM.
IF YOU CAN LOCK DOWN THE

522
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
CLASSROOM, GET THE CHILDREN DOWN

523
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ON THE FLOOR, TAKE THEIR DESKS

524
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
LAY THEM OVER GET BEHIND THE

525
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
DESKS LOCK THE DOOR SO THE

526
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
SHOOTER DOESN'T GAIN ACCESS TO

527
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THAT.
THE FIRST TWO OR THREE MINUTES

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENT IS

529
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THE DEADLIEST.

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
SLOW HIM DOWN SO THAT IF WE SLOW

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
HIM DOWN THE POLICE CAN RESPOND

533
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
AND THEN THE POLICE CAN DEAL

534
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
WITH HIM.

535
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
>> VERY QUICKLY, YOU WERE A

536
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
DETECTIVE, HOMICIDE DETECTIVE AT

537
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
NYPD.
THESE GUNS WE WERE HEARING ABOUT

538
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
THE GLOCH THE BUSHMASTER A LOT

539
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OF VIEWERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

540
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
ARE CAPABLE OF.

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
A SEMIAUTOMATIC THEY ARE TALKING

542
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
ABOUT 30 ROUNDS TO A CLIP.

543
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
HOW QUICKLY CAN THAT GO OFF?

544
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
>> YOU HAVE THE BUSHMASTER.

545
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
>> WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE SCREEN

546
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
RIGHT THERE.

547
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
>> YOU HAVE THE 223 OR 2.56

548
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
ROUND MILITARY ROUND.

549
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
YOU CAN EMPTY A 30 ROUND CLIP IN

550
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
LESS THAN 15 SECONDS IF YOU ARE

551
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
REALLY TRAINED TO DO THAT.

552
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
>> THAT IS SCARY.

553
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
>> THEY SAID THERE WERE HUNDREDS

554
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
OF ROUNDS.

YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

668

THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE SOCIAL

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
UPON IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS IT

690

698
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THAT'S ALMOST AN EXCUSE AS WELL.

INSANE.

710
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000

THE CASE.

712
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
HOW THE SHOOTINGS WERE COMMITTED

>> WE DON'T KNOW.

720
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
BUT CLEARLY THERE WAS A

721
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
BE VERY CONFLICTED.

732
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
PERHAPS HER SON GOT WORSE AS

733
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
TIME WENT ON.

734
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

735
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR SOME REASON

736
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEY WERE TOO ISOLATED THAT THE

737
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
MOTHER AND SON HAD TOO MUCH TIME

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000

WHO MIGHT COMMIT A CRIME LIKE

912
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000

AND ADULTS THEY ARE AFRAID OF

IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET PEOPLE

00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
DETAIN THEM.

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
LET ME TELL YOU THERE IS NO PILL

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THERE MIGHT BE A PRAYER BUT

925
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000

US TODAY.

1002
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I GUESS THE QUESTION WE ALL ASK

1003
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
IS AN ALL KNOWING POWERFUL

1004
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
LOVING GOD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

1005
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
>> THE WAY I LOOK AT THE

1006
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
QUESTION IS, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

1007
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE WITHOUT

1008
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
GOD THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.

1009
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THIS MAN TURNED AWAY FROM GOD

1010
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
OBVIOUSLY AND DID SOMETHING

1011
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
TREMENDOUS.

1012
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
KILLING YOUR OWN MOTHER AND

1013
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
KILLING INNOCENT CHILDREN SO

1014
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
AGAINST NATURE COMPLETELY

1015
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
AGAINST THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

1016
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
GOD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

1017
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE FREE

1018
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
CHOICES.

1019
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I NOTICE THAT PUBLIC REACTION IS

1020
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
NOT TO TURN AWAY FROM GOD AND

1021
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
BLAME HIM.

1022
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
IT'S TO GO TO GOD AND PRAY FOR

1023
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
SYMPATHY AND THE VICTIMS AND

1024
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
CONSTELLATION.

1025
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
>> YOU KNOW FATHER CAN YOU

ANGEL AND WILL BE BURYING THESE

1028
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
CHILDREN THIS WEEK CAN TURN AWAY

1029
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
AND SAY, HOW COULD GOD TAKE MY

1030
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
CHILD FROM ME?

1031
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
>>> OO GOD DIDN'T DO IT.

1032
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THE MESSAGE WE SAY IS GOD LOVES

1033
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
THAT CHILD.

1034
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
THAT'S THE HOPE OF CHRISTIANITY.

1035
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
JESUS HAVING HIS LITTLE ONES.

1036
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
THE ANSWER IS MORE COMPLICATED

1037
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THAN SOMEBODY MIGHT LIKE.

1038
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
WE NEVER KNOW WHEN THE CALL IS

1039
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
GOING TO COME.
THIS IS HORRIBLE IT SHOULDN'T

1040
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
HAPPEN.

1041
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A PROOF

1042
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
WE HAVE TO FIGHT EVIL NOT

1043
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
TOLERATE IT.

1044
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
>> I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOLS

1045
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
AND I AM A CATHOLIC.

1046
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I STAUND WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN FREE

1047
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WILL, BUT YOU KNOW THE ABILITY

1048
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

1049
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
STILL -- IT ALLOWS THOSE OTHER

1050
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
PEOPLE TO CHOOSE EVIL.

1051
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN'T STOP.

1052
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
>> WE CAN OFFER ANOTHER LAW, A

1053
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
LAW OF LOVE AND TRAINING IN

1054
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
SYMPATHY.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO READ

1055
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
WHAT PART RELIGION PLAYED IN HIS

1056
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
PLAN'S LIFE, IF ANYTHING.

1057
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000

HE SAID, I AM NOT ANGRY.

1063
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I FOR GIVE.

1064
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000

1065
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT BEFORE?

1066
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
>> I HAVE.

1067
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
AS WE RESPOND TO DISASTERS.

1068
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WE MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

1069
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
FOUNDATION OF FAITH.

1070
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
A FAITH IN CHRIST.

1071
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

1072
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
FOUNDATION OF FAITH AT ALL.

1073
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
IT IS A TESTIMONY OF WHAT GODS

1074
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
HAS DONE IN SOMEONE'S LIFE THAT

1075
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
IS FOUNDATIONAL.

1076
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THEY HAVE A FAITH IN CHRIST.

1077
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
THEY KNOW THAT IS THEIR SOURCE

1078
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
OF HOPE, THEIR SOURCE OF COMFORT

1079
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
AND WHEN THEY DO TURN TO CHRIST

1080
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
AND TO GOD'S WORD THAT OFFERS

1081
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THAT HOPE THEY ARE THE ONES.

1082
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
NOT TO SAY THEY DON'T HURT, THEY

1083
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
DON'T SUFFER, IT'S STILL AN

1084
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
AGONIZING LOSS FOR THEM.

1085
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY ONE ELSE.

1086
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
IT LOOKS LIKE A REALITY WHEN YOU

1087
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
HAVE A FAITH IN CHRIST AND YOU

1088
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
CAN PUT YOUR COMPETENCE IN HIM

1089
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
AND FOCUS HIS FOLKS ON HIS TEAM.

DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

1098
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THEY WILL COME TO GOD AS A

1099
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
RESULT OF THIS?

WE SIMPLY CHOOSE TO DO.

1104
