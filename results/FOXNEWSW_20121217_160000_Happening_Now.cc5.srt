79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS REMARKABLE.

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
>> I DON'T EVEN LIVE IN THIS

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
TOWN, BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000

GRIEF.
>> IN A TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WE ARE ONE, WE ARE ONE NATION.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
JON: MEANTIME INVESTIGATORS ARE

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TRIGGERED ADAM LANZA'S DEADLY

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
RAMPAGE.

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000

HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
YOU'VE AMMO TO TAKEOUT ABOUT

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
EVERY STUDENT IN THERE.

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> HE SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SCHOOL.
THE SCHOOL WAS LOCKED.

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
HE USED A WEAPON TO OPEN UP THE

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
GLASS AND THEN --

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
>> HE BLASTED RIGHT THROUGH IT,

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
RIGHT?

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
>> WITH SEVERAL -- A NUMBER OF

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ROUNDS.
HE DISCHARGED TO MAKE AN OPENING

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AND THEN WENT THROUGH IT, WENT

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
TO THE FIRST CLASSROOM, AS YOU

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
KNOW, WENT TO THE SECOND

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CLASSROOM.

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WE SURMISE THAT IT WAS DURING

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE SECOND CLASSROOM EPISODE

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THAT HE HEARD RESPONDERS COMING

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AND APPARENTLY AT THAT DECIDED

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THERE ARE NOW QUESTIONS ABOUT

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WHETHER THE SCHOOL WILL EVER

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
REOPEN ITS DOORS TO THE

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
INVESTIGATORS AS APPROPRIATE.

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THE INVESTIGATORS WILL DETERMINE

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
HOW, WHEN, WHERE AND WHY WE'LL

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
DO THIS.

158
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
AGAIN UNDERSTANDING WE WILL

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000

JON: AND THE GUNMAN AT SANDY

174
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
HOOK, SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

175
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE MOTIVATION AND THE

176
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
BACKGROUND.
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT HIM.

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000

UP TO A DOZEN PEOPLE THERE ARE

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000

KATE MIDDLETON PRESENTING AWARDS

LONDON.
JENNA: BACK TO OUR TOP STORY NOW

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THE KOPBD CONNECTICUT SCHOOL

390
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
MASSACRE.

391
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AS WE AWAIT THE FUNERALS OF TWO

392
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YOUNG PEOPLE KILLED IN THAT

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
RAMPAGE INVESTIGATORS ARE

394
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
POURING OVERCOME PURSUITERS

395
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ADAM

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
LANZA PLANNED HIS SPREE.

397
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
WHERE DO YOU START THE

398
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
INVESTIGATION?
>> FIRST NEED TO PLEASE

399
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FAMILIES AND

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
SLIMS.
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES.

401
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
SO OUR DIGITAL LIVES ARE A

402
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WINDOW INTO OUR MINDS.

403
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
AND BY DISCOVERING A PERSON'S

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
DIGITAL LIFE YOU ESSENTIALLY CAN

405
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
MAP OUT THEIR LIFE'S PAST AND

406
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
FUTURE INTENTIONS, AND THE POINT

407
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
OF A DIGITAL DISCOVERY

408
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
ESSENTIALLY IS TO FIND OUT WHAT

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
HAPPENED, AND ESSENTIALLY HOW TO

410
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE AS

411
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WELL.
JENNA: SO WHERE DO YOU START

412
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
WITH THE MATERIAL THAT YOU MIGHT

413
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HAVE IN A TYPICAL CASE?

414
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
>> EASILY, VERY SIMPLY AS YOU

415
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WOULD WITH YOUR OWN DEVICE, FROM

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THE DESKTOP IN YOU SCAR THE HARD

417
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DRIVE LOOKING THROUGH ALL

418
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
DIFFERENT DOCUMENT FOLDERS,

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT

420
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
FILES AND FOLDERS, THE NAMES OF

421
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THEM, THE DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS

422
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
WITHIN, AND THEN GOING THROUGH

423
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WEB HISTORIES, WEB HISTORY CAN

424
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
DETERMINE WHAT WEB SITES THEY

425
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
VISITED.

426
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
ALSO BY LOOKING AT ANY FORENSICS

427
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
IN REGARDS TO CHAT LOGS, ANY

428
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
COMMUNICATIONS THAT THERE MIGHT

429
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
BE WITH OTHERS.

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
JENNA: HOW FAR BACK CAN YOU GO,

431
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
ROBERT WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT

432
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SOME OF THOSE HISTORIES THAT YOU

433
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
CAN LOOK THROUGH, FOR SOMEONE

434
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THAT IS 20 20 YEARS OLD, FOR

435
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
EXAMPLE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE AT THE

437
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
MOTHER'S HOUSE BUT AUTHORITIES

438
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
HAVE BEEN VERY TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT

439
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
IT.
HOW FAR BACK WOULD ANY DEVICE, A

440
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
TYPICAL DEVICE IN A FAMILY'S

441
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
HOME PROVIDE YOU?

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
YEARS?
ARE WE TALKING MONTHS, WEEKS?

443
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE.

444
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
>> GREAT QUESTION.

445
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THINK OF YOUR OWN DIGITAL

446
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
DEVICES, FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN MY

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
OWN HOME AND OFFICE I HAVE

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
DEVICE AS OLD AS TEN TO 12 YEARS

449
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
OLD AND ALL OF THOSE HOLD

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
HISTORY OF WEB TRAFFIC, AND

451
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS, AND YOU

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
CAN GO BACK AS LONG AS THE

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
DEVICE IS OLD.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
AND IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY

455
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TRANSFER OF DATA FROM AN EVEN

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OLDER DEVICE THEN ALL THAT

457
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
HISTORY REMAINS.

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
JENNA: INTERESTING.

459
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> AND THEN IF THE PERSON WAS

460
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
PROFICIENT AT CLEARING THEIR

461
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
HISTORY, THEN THERE IS LESS

462
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE FOUND,

463
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
BUT, AGAIN, DEPENDING ON THE

464
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OPERATING SYSTEM, IN DIFFERENT

465
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
PARTITIONS THAT MIGHT BE SET UP

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A LOT OF DATA CAN BE DISCOVERED

467
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WITH THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY.

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
JENNA: THE AUTHORITIES AGAIN

469
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
HAVE BEEN VERY TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT

470
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE.

471
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WE HAVE INITIAL REPORTS, AND

472
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW IF THESE

473
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
REPORTS ARE REAL OR NOT, THAT

474
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE

475
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
DESTROYED SOME OF THE COMPUTER.

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THE INITIAL REPORTS SAID A HARD

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
DRY.
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS

478
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
TRUE.

479
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THE SCENARIO

480
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
YOU'RE DEALING WITH, DOES THAT

481
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
LIMIT YOU IN ANYWAY?

482
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
>> IT CERTAINLY DOES.

483
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
AND THE ABILITY OF THE OFFENDER

484
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
TO ESSENTIALLY DESTROY THAT

485
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DEVICE VERSUS THE ABILITY OF SAY

486
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
A FORENSICS EXPERT TO DISCOVER

487
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
IT MAY VARY.

488
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A GOOD FORENSICS EXPERT WITH THE

489
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY CAN GET DELET

490
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
DELETED OR EVEN DESTROYED DATA,

491
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
AGAIN, IT'S A COUNTY AND MOUS A

492
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
CAT AND MOUSE GAME.

493
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
BASED ON WHAT THEY ARE ALREADY

494
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
FINDING AND WHAT THEY WILL FIND

495
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

496
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WHETHER OR NOT THIS INDIVIDUAL

497
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HAD CONSPIRED WITH OTHERS, AND

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THEY WILL MORE THAN LIKELY FIND

499
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
WHAT HIS TRIGGER POINT MIGHT

500
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
HAVE BEEN IN ORDER TO BASICALLY

501
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
DEVICE THIS PLAN AND WHY.

502
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
JENNA: AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE ON

503
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SATURDAY THE OFFICIALS SEEMED

504
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
HOPEFUL ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THAT

505
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THEY FOUND AT THE MOTHER'S

506
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HOUSE.

507
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WE'LL WAIT TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT

508
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
THAT PRODUCES AND WHAT ANSWERS,

509
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
MAYBE, MAYBE IT PROVIDES IN A

510
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
CASE LIKE THIS.

511
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ROBERT, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPERTISE

513
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU.

514
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
JON: WE ARE GETTING BRAND-NEW

515
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
DETAILS ON THE DEADLY ATTACK ON

516
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
OUR CONSULATE IN LIBYA THAT

517
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
KILLED OUR AMBASSADOR AND THREE

518
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OTHER MEN.

519
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A NEW INDEPENDENT REPORT IS DUE

520
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
OUT.

521
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WHAT IT COULD TELL US AS THE

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
STATE DEPARTMENT PREPARES TO

523
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT

524
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

525
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
PLUS, OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES ON

526
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
THE TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT.

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
COMING UP THE MASSACRE REOPEN

528
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE DEBATE ABOUT WHAT TO DO

529
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS IN THIS

530
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
COUNTRY.

531
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
JON: RIGHT NOW WE ARE AWAITING

532
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
DETAILS OF AN INDEPENDENT REPORT

533
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ON THE DEADLY ASSAULT ON OUR

534
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
CONSULATE IN LIBYA.

535
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THAT REPORT LOOKS INTO WHAT LED

536
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
UP TO THE ATTACK ON

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
SEPTEMBER 11th.

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
IT IS EXPECTED TO BE TURNED OVER

539
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
TO STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS

540
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
TODAY.
AS YOU KNOW FOUR AMERICANS WERE

541
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
KILLED IN OUR CONSULATE WHEN IT

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
CAME UNDER FIRE IN BENGHAZI,

543
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
INCLUDING OUR AMBASSADOR TO

544
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
LIBYA, CHRIS STEVENS.

545
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY

546
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
CLINTON CREATED THE INDEPENDENT

547
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
REVIEW BOARD, HOWEVER, SHE WILL

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
NOT BE ABLE TO TESTIFY AT THE

549
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
BENGHAZI HEARINGS LATER THIS

550
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
WEEK BECAUSE OF A CONCUSSION.

551
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT ALL WITH

552
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
STEVEN YATES A FORMER DEPUTY

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ASSISTANT FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
STEVEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH

557
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
US TODAY.

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
>> GLAD TO BE WITH YOU, JON.

559
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
JON: THIS INDEPENDENT ADVISORY

560
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
REVIEW BOARD WAS APPOINTED BY

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
DOES THAT MEAN IT'S CONTROLLED

562
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR DOES

563
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
IT LIVE UP TO IT'S TITLE OF

564
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
INDEPENDENCE IN.

565
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
>> IT'S INDEPENDENT IN THE SENSE

566
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITHIN THE

567
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
BUREAUCRACY.
IT WILL BE FORMER OFFICIALS THAT

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
GUIDE THE EFFORT.

569
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
IT WILL BE INFORMED VERY MUCH BY

570
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
SOURCES WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY

571
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ITSELF.
I THINK IT'S PART OF AN EFFORT

572
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
TO FOCUS MORE ON LOWER-LEVEL

573
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
BUREAUCRAT PARTICULAR DECISIONS

574
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
AND OPERATIONAL DECISIONS AND

575
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
AWAY FROM POLITICAL AND POLICY

576
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
DECISION HAS FED INTO THE

577
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
CONTROVERSY.
JON: DO YOU EXPECT WHATEVER IS

578
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
IN THE REPORT IS GOING TO END

579
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
THE CONTROVERSY OVER BENGHAZI?

580
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I DOUBT VERY MUCH IT WILL END

581
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THE CONTROVERTS SEE.

582
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IT MAY ADVANCE THE

583
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
CONVERSATION.

584
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

585
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE SECURITY

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
POSTURE WAS WHERE IT WAS IN

587
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
BENGHAZI ON THAT FATEFUL DAY BUT

588
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IT WON'T REALLY I THINK GET AT

589
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THE BROADER QUESTION OF WHY DOES

590
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
THERE SEEM TO BE AN UNDER

591
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
ESTIMATION OF THE NATURE AND

592
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
SCOPE OF THE THREAT WE FACE IN

593
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THAT BROADER REGION AND WHY DID

594
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THE AMBASSADOR FEEL IT WAS

595
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
VISIBLADD VISIBLE TO TRAVEL

596
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
OUTSIDE OF THAT COMPOUND THAT

597
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DAY.
JON: CONGRESS WILL BE TAKING A

598
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
LOCK AT THIS REPORT AS WELL,

599
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
CORRECT?

600
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
>> THEY WILL INDEED.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT

601
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
EVER HEARINGS FEATURING THE

602
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
SECRETARY OF STATE LATER IN THE

603
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WEEK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER

604
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
HEALTH ISSUES.

605
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I PRESUME AT SOME POINT SHE WILL

606
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
STAND BEFORE THE COMMITTEES IN

607
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO

608
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
OFFER HER ACCOUNT.

609
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
BUT EVEN THOSE WILL JUST BE

610
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
PIECES OF INFORMATION.

611
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
ULTIMATELY DECISIONS MADE IN THE

612
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
WHITE HOUSE AND THE EXECUTIVE

613
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
BRANCH IN THEIR INTERNAL

614
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
DELIBERATIONS TEND TO BE SHIELD

615
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
FROM CONGRESS.

616
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ALL CONGRESS CAN DO IS CRY FOUL

617
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
AND CALL FOR MORE INFORMATION.

618
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
JON: EVERYONE IS WONDERING ABOUT

619
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THE TIMING OF SECRETARY

620
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
CLINTON'S UNAVAILABILITY.

621
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
SHE WILL YOU EXPECT TESTIFY AT

622
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
SOME POINT ONCE SHE'SE SHE'S

623
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
RECOVERED FROM HER INJURY.

624
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>> I THINK CONGRESS IS WITHIN

625
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
ITS RIGHTS TO CALL HER AT ANY

626
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
TIME.
I HAVE NO REASON TO SECOND-GUESS

627
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
HER HEALTH STANDING AT THE

628
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
CURRENT MOMENT.

629
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I PRESUME THAT SHE WILL IMPROVE

630
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
IN HER HEALTH.

631
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
EVEN AFTER SHE IS NO LONGER

632
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SECRETARY OF STATE SHE STILL

633
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
WOULD BE A KEY WITNESS WITH REAL

634
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INFORMATION, TESTIFYING THE WAY

635
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
GENERAL PETRAEUS DID ALSO.

636
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
UT WHAT HAPPENED LOT OF

637
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
HERE THAT ARE GOING TO LIVE ON

638
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BEYOND HER HOLDING OF THAT

639
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
OFFICE.

640
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
WOULD YOU EXPT THAT YOU'LL GET

641
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SOME INFORMATION WHEN OTHER

642
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
INCOMING -- SAY IF IT IS SENATOR

643
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
KERRY WHO COMES IN AS SEC OF

644
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
STATE, WILL THERE BE MORE

645
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
INFORMATION FORTHCOMING?

646
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> WELL, I WOULD EXPECT THAT HE

647
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WOULD HAVE EVERY INTEREST

648
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
INLETTING THIS BE YESTERDAY'S

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
BUSINESS AND TO MOVE ONTO

650
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
FOCUSING ON WHAT HE SEES AS THE

651
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
PRIORITY GUIDING HIS NEW TENURE

652
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
AS SEC OF STATE.
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD WANT TO

653
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
DRAW TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.

654
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
BUT HE WOULD WANT TO AT LEAST

655
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
OPERATIONALLY WRAP-UP WHAT

656
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
HAPPENED WITH EMBASSY SECURITY

657
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
AND TPAOEP OTHER FACILITIE KEEP

658
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
OTHER FACILITIES GOING IN THE

659
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
FUTURE.

660
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
JON: WHOEVER SUCCEEDS HILLARY

661
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
CLINTON IS GOING TO FIND THE

662
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SAME OPERATION IN PLACE, RIGHT?

663
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
THERE ARE THINGS THAT CLEARLY

664
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
NEED TO BE FIXED.

665
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
>> OPERATIONAL THINGS THAT NEED

666
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
TO BE FIXED.
THERE ARE THINGS IN CONJUNCTION

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
WITH THE MILITARY TO INSURE

668
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THERE ARE RESCUE OPENINGS

669
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
READILY AVAILABLE SUDDEN CON SIN

670
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
GENT SEES PRESENT THEMSELVES.

671
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THERE ARE POLICY DECISIONS, WHAT

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
IS THIS ENEMY, WHAT IS ITS

673
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
NATURE, HOW MUCH OF A THREAT

674
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
DOES IT POSE.
ARE WE TELLING THE TRUTH TO

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
EMPTY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1119
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
NO ONE IS THERE.

1120
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
NO VICTIMS ARE THERE.

1121
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
YOU'RE WALKING INTO THIS

1122
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
SCENE, PAT.

1123
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WHERE DO YOU EVEN BEGIN AS

1124
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
AN INVESTIGATOR?

1125
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
>> WELL, THIS OBVIOUSLY IS

1126
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
THE HORROR AMONGST HORRORS.

1127
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WE KNOW THAT IS WELL STOOESHED.

1128
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
BUT INORDINANTLY COMPLEX

1129
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
CRIME SCENE WITH MANY MOVING

1130
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
PARTS.
THERE ARE FACTORS BEYOND RYE

1131
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
APPROACH.
WE KNOW HOW MANY SHOTS WERE

1132
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
FIRED AND VICTIMS.

1133
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
HE LEFT HUNDREDS OF BULLETS.

1134
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
EACH ONE HAS A STORY TO

1135
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
TELL.
THEY WANT TO EXAMINE THOSE

1136
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
BULLETS GOING BACK FROM
THEIR BIRTH, ON THE

1137
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
GUNSMITH'S TABLE TO THE

1138
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
DECEMBER 14th AT 9:30 A.M.

1139
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
CRITICAL.
JENNA: LET ME RETURN TO THAT

1140
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
POINT IN A SECOND BECAUSE WE

1141
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
JUST GOT THIS VIDEO IN.

1142
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN,

1143
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THESE ARE HUGE MOVING VANS

1144
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, PAT, TO

1145
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
OUR VIEWERS.

1146
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
YOU THINK SOME OF THESE

1147
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
DESKS AND CHAIRS,

1148
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
POTENTIALLY FURNITURE COMING

1149
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
OUT OF THE CLASSROOM MIGHT

1150
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CONTAIN BULLETS AND THAT IS

1151
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
WHAT THEY WILL LOOK AT.

1152
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
GO BACK TO THE CRITICAL

1153
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
ST BULLET CAN

1154
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
TELL US.

1155
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
WITH SO MUCH MATERIAL WE

1156
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
BELIEVE THAT IS THERE AND

1157
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
OFFICIALS HAVE ALLUDED TO,

1158
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
HOW DO YOU BRING IT TOGETHER

1159
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
AND WHAT REALLY IS A

1160
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
REALISTIC TIMELINE FOR ANY

1161
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SORT OF ANSWERS THAT IT

1162
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
COULD PROVIDE?

1163
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
>> WELL TO START THE LAST

1164
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
QUESTION A TIMELINE IS

1165
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO SPECULATE.

1166
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
INORDINANTLY COMPLEX CASE.

1167
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HE FIRED HUNDREDS OF

1168
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
BULLETS.
THAT ALONE IS VERY UNUSUAL

1169
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
AND COMPOUNDS THE TRAGEDY

1170
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
EXPONENTIALLY.
BUT THE FACT IS EACH ONE OF

1171
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
THOSE BULLETS, EACH AND

1172
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
EVERYONE IS STAND ALONE

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
PIECE OF EVIDENTIARY

1174
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
MATERIAL.

1175
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
HAS TO BE FORSENICALLY

1176
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
ANALYZED.

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
TESTED AGAINST RIVALLING OF

1178
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
BULLETS, RIFLING OF WEAPONS,

1179
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND HAS TO BE RESEARCH WHEN

1180
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
IT CAME TO BIRTH, WHEN THAT

1181
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
BULLET CAME TO LIFE UNTIL

1182
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THE BULLET WAS USED ON THE

1183
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
14th.
THERE MAY BE OTHER

1184
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
SHOOTINGS.

1185
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
JENNA: HOW INTERESTING.
>> YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS PUT

1186
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
THE EYE TOWARD OTHER

1187
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
COLLATERAL SHOOTINGS.

1188
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
>> MIGHT HAVE TO KEEP YOUR

1189
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
MIND OPEN AT A TIME LIKE

1190
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THIS.
>> PRECISELY.

1191
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
SAME WITH WEAPONS TOO,

1192
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
JENNA.

1193
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THOSE WEAPONS HAVE TO BE

1194
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
LOOKED AT VERY CLOSELY WHEN

1195
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
THEY LEFT THE GUNSMITH'S

1196
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TABLE UNTIL THEY --.

1197
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
JENNA: TALKING A LOT ABOUT

1198
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
FRIENDSIC EVIDENCE.

1199
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
ONE OF THE THINGS PAUL VANCE

1200
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
BROUGHT UP AS WELL DURING

1201
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THE NEWS CONFERENCE THE

1202
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
INTERVIEWING OF WITNESSES
AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE

1203
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
SAID THEY WILL BE

1204
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
INTERVIEWING CHILDREN.

1205
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> YES.
JENNA: HOW DO YOU DO THAT,

1206
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
PAT?

1207
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> WITH EXTRAORDINARY

1208
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
DELICACY, EXTREME

1209
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SENSITIVITY.
VERY, VERY, SLOWLY IN THE

1210
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
PRESENCE OF THE PARENTS AND

1211
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WITH HIGHLY, HIGHLY SKILLED,

1212
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATORS

1213
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
WHO HAVE CONDUCTED THOSE

1214
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
LEVELS OF INTERVIEWS BEFORE.

1215
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
JENNA: DO YOU START NOW,

1216
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
WAIT A COUPLE WEEKS, WHEN DO

1217
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
YOU DO IT?
>> I DON'T THINK THEY WILL

1218
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
START NOW.

1219
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
INTERESTINGLY, MY EXPERIENCE

1220
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
WITH INTERVIEWING VERY YOUNG

1221
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
CHILDREN THEY ARE GREAT

1222
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
WITNESSES BOTH EARWITNESSES

1223
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AND EYEWITNESSES.

1224
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
>> REALLY?
>> BECAUSE THEIR RECALL IS

1225
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
NOT INFLUENCED BY BASELINE

1226
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
HISTORY OF OTHER EVENTS.

1227
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
THEY'RE BRAND NEW.

1228
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
THEY'RE YOUNG.
THEY DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT

1229
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
IN THEIR MEMORIES.

1230
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
IT IS VERY SAD WAY TO LOOK

1231
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
AT IT BUT VERY PRAGMATIC WAY

1232
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
TO LOOK AT I.

1233
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
THEY MAKE GREAT WITNESSES.

1234
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
EVERYTHING IS UNVARNISHED

1235
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
EVERYTHING IS TRUE.

1236
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
NO AGENDA WITH THE SMALL

1237
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
FRIES.

1238
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
THEY DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA.

1239
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
WHEN TEASE OUT THE

1240
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
INFORMATION, DELICATELY

1241
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
EXTRACT THE INFORMATION

1242
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
PIECE BY PIECE IT COULD BE

1243
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
VERY VITAL DATA.

1244
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
JENNA: UNDERSCORES THE

1245
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SADNESS WE FEEL ABOUT THEIR

1246
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
LIVES.

1247
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
>> TOTALLY.
JENNA: HOW INNOCENT THEY

1248
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
ARE.

1249
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
>> WORST EVER.
JENNA: PAT, THANK YOU.

1250
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1251
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
JENNA: I APPRECIATE YOU

1252
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
WALKING US THROUGH THIS AS

1253
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WE TRY TO WRAP OUR MIND

1254
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
AROUND IT SOMEHOW AND SEARCH

1255
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
FOR ANSWERS SOMEHOW IN THIS

1256
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
CASE.

1257
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THANK YOU AGAIN.

1258
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1259
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
JENNA: JON?
JON: RIGHT NOW IN EGYPT

1260
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
TENSIONS ARE ON THE RISE AS

1261
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
RIVAL GROUPS OPPOSING THE

1262
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000

GREG?
>> Reporter: HEY, JON, YEAH.

1274
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
FOLKS ARE A LITTLE BIT ON

1275
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
EDGE OFF VOTING OVER THE

WEEKEND ON THE DRAFT

1277
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
CONSTITUTION.
THE RESULTS WERE CLOSER THAN

1278
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
EXPECTED.
THE YES VOTES WERE 57%.

1279
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
NO, 43%.

1280
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THE TURNOUT WAS LOWER THAN

1281
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
USUAL.
ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION

1282
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THE VOTE WAS MARCHED BY

1283
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
MAURED BY WIDESPREAD

1284
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
IRREGULARITIS.

1285
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
OPPOSITION ATTACKING

1286
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
OPPOSITION HEADQUARTERS HERE

1287
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
IN CAIRO.
ALL THAT IS PROMPTING AGAIN

1288
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
BY GOVERNMENT CRITICS WHO

1289
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
CALLED FOR MORE PROTESTS ON

00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
>> THAT IS BIG ISSUE.

1484
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
ASPERGER'S IS ON THE AUTISM

1485
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
SPECTRUM.

1486
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
HE WAS REPORTED EXTREMELY

1487
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
SHY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH

1488
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
ASPERGERS ARE VERY SOCIAL

1489
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
BUT THERE IS QUIRKINESS TO

1490
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THEM WHEN YOU START TO TALK

1491
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
TO THEM.

1492
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
CERTAINLY ASPERGER'S IS NOT

1493
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
PREDISPOSITION TO THAT.

1494
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, A

1495
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PATIENT COMES INTO THE E.R.

1496
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DYING

1497
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
MOST SIS OR ILLNESS, YOU

1498
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
NEED TO DECIDE AT THE TIME

1499
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ARE THEY A RISK TO

1500
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AND YOU

1501
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
CAN NEVER FULLY PREDICT WHEN

1502
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS GOING

1503
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
TO HAPPEN, WHEN SOMEONE IS

1504
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
GOING TO BECOME VIOLENT,

1505
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO SNAP.

1506
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THAT'S A BIG ISSUE, BUT

1507
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
CERTAINLY IF WE DEALT MORE

1508
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
PREVENTATIVELY, MORE

1509
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000

INPATIENT BEDS FOR PATIENTS

1512
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
IN CRISIS, SO THEY DON'T GET

1513
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
TURNED OUT ON THE STREET YOU

1514
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCES OF

1515
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
SOME KIND OF VIOLENT

1516
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
SNAPPING OR SOME KIND OF

1517
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
VIOLENT INCIDENT.

STAGES OF DOING THAT.

OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF DECISIONS

1522
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
NEED TO BE MADE.

1523
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
SIMILAR DISORDER, WITH A

1665
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
SIMILAR -- HE HAS A SON WHO'S

1666
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
AUTISTIC, AND HE SAID HE USED TO

1667
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
BOND WITH NANCY LANZA ABOUT THE

1668
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
DIFFICULTIES OF RAISING A CHILD

1669
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
WITH A DISORDER LIKE THAT.

1670
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
AND HE SAID THAT HE THINKS THAT

1671
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
AS A SINGLE MOTHER SHE WAS NOT

1672
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH HIS

1673
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
ISSUES.
LISTEN TO THIS.

1674
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
>> YEAH.
SHE WAS TRYING TO BOND, FIND

1675
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
WAYS TO BOND WITH HIM, AND, YOU

1676
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
KNOW, SHE TOLD ME THAT THE GUNS,

1677
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD TAKE THEM

1678
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
SHOOTING BECAUSE THAT WAS OF OF

1679
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
A WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, A SINGLE

1680
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
MOM COULD, YOU KNOW, RELATE TO

1681
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
HER SON.

1682
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
AND SO SHE WOULD TAKE HIM, TAKE

1683
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
HIM OUT SHOOTING.

1684
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
>> Reporter: WE'VE BEEN

1685
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION,

1686
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
JON, FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND

1687
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
FROM FRIENDS OF THE, OF EVERYONE

1688
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
INVOLVED X WE DO EXPECT AN

1689
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
UPDATE ANY MINUTE NOW.

1690
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
JON: YEAH.

1691
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
THAT UPDATE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN,

1692
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
AS YOU SAY, ANYTIME NOW.

1693
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
PETER DOOCY IN NEWTOWN, THANK

1694
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
YOU.

1695
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
JENNA: IT'S UNCLEAR IF SANDY

1696
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY WILL EVER REOPEN

1697
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
O.
TOWN OFFICIALS ARE CONSIDERING A

1698
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
PLAN TO SEND STUDENTS TO A

1699
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
FORMER SCHOOL BUILDING JUST

1700
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
MILES AWAY.
WE'VE HEARD THAT.

1701
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
ALSO MAYBE THEY'LL BE SENT TO

1702
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT.

1703
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
IT COULD BE MONTHS BEFORE THE

1704
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
SCHOOL IS RELEASED BACK TO THE

1705
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
DISTRICT.

1706
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
>> WE ARE HOLDING BOTH CRIME

1707
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
SCENES, THE SCHOOL AND THE

1708
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
SECOND DARE CRIME SCENE --

1709
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
SECONDARY CRIME SCENE,

1710
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
INDEFINITELY.

1711
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
WE'VE SEIZED IT UNDER SEARCH

1712
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
WARRANTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO

1713
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
HOLD THOSE UNTIL WE FEEL IT'S

1714
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
APPROPRIATE TO LET THEM GO.

1715
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
SO AS NOT TO READ ANYTHING INTO

1716
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
THAT, IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO

1717
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
DO THAT, TO HOLD ON TO THE CRIME

1718
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
SCENE AS LONG AS IT'S NEEDED FOR

1719
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
INVESTIGATORY PURPOSES.

1720
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
JENNA: BRIAN WAS EL HAS TREATED

1721
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
CHILDREN AFTER TRAUMA WHICH IS,

1722
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'M SURE, AN INCREDIBLE TASK,

1723
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
DR. RUSSELL.
IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION FOR

1724
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
THAT CHILDREN THAT EITHER HAVE

1725
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
WITNESSED THIS EVENT OR WERE AT

1726
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME, WHAT'S

1727
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS?

1728
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
IS IT TO RETURN TO THE BUILDING

1729
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE?

1730
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM?

1731
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, JENNA, WE

1732
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THESE SAME

1733
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
THINGS AFTER KOHL M WINE, AND

1734
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
IT'S REALLY SORT OF PREMATURE TO

1735
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
BE TALKING ABOUT THE LONG-TERM

1736
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
FUTURE OF THAT BUILDING.

1737
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
OBVIOUSLY, IN THE SHORT TERM IT

1738
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
IS A CRIME SCENE, AND IT'S GOING

1739
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
TO NEED TO BE KEPT THAT WAY FOR

1740
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
EVIDENTIARY GATHERING PURPOSES.

1741
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

1742
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
IN MIND THAT LOTS OF KIDS AROUND

1743
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOSE

1744
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE

1745
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
COVERAGE OF THIS, MAY NEED SOME

1746
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
ATTENTION.
BUT IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE THE

1747
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
KIND.
KIDS ARE VERY RESILIENT, THAT'S

1748
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
THE GOOD NEWS, AND IT'S HARD TO

1749
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
SAY EXACTLY HOW EACH INDIVIDUAL

1750
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
KID IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED,

1751
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

1752
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
INDIVIDUALIZED THING.

1753
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
SOME GENERAL TIPS FOR

1754
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE TO LISTEN

1755
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
TO -- FOR PARENTS WOULD BE TO

1756
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
LISTEN TO THEIR KIDS.

1757
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
KIDS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS

1758
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
AFFECTED AS A PARENT MAY ASSUME,

1759
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
AND THEY CAN MINIMIZE THE

1760
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
FURTHER EFFECTS BY NOT HAVING

1761
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
THIS ALL OVER THE TV ON THEIR

1762
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
HOUSE ALL DAY LONG, TO VALIDATE

1763
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
WHATEVER FEELINGS THE KIDS ARE

1764
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
HAVING ABOUT IT AND REASSURE

1765
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
THEM.
THIS THREATENS KIDS' SENSE THAT

1766
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
THEIR WORLD WITH PREDICTABLE AND

1767
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
SAFE AND SECURE AND STABLE.

1768
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
YOU COULD REFOCUS YOUR KIDS OFF

1769
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
OF THE GORY DETAILS AND ON TO

1770
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
THE POSITIVE ASPECTS LIKE THE

1771
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
HEROISM OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS

1772
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
AND SOME OF THE STAFF THERE.

1773
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE SOME

1774
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
ACTION LIKE MAYBE TAKE YOUR KIDS

1775
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
WITH YOU IF YOU GIVE BLOOD, OR

1776
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
MAKE SOME CHRISTMAS COOKIES AND

1777
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
TAKE THEM TO THE FIRST

1778
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
RESPONDERS IN YOUR AREAS THAT

1779
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
THE ADULTS, THE GOOD GUYS ARE

1780
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
BACK IN CHARGE.

1781
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
AND IF NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO BE

1782
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
WORKING, SEEK OUT A MENTAL

1783
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN YOUR

1784
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
COMMUNITY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR.

1785
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
JENNA: SO MANY OF US CARE ABOUT

1786
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
THIS COMMUNITY NOW AND WANT TO

1787
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
HELP IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN.

1788
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
FOR THE CHILDREN THERE, I KNOW

1789
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
WE DON'T WANT TO THINK TOO LONG

1790
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
TERM, BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS IT

1791
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
FOR THEM TO STAY TOGETHER, TO

1792
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
NOT BE SPLIT UP?

1793
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

1794
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
RETURN TO SCHOOL EVENTUALLY, AND

1795
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
PROBABLY IN NOT TOO DISTANT

1796
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
FUTURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

1797
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
HAVE TO RETURN THE TO SCHOOL.

1798
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
SO WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION

1799
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
THERE?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE A

1800
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
GREAT POINT.

1801
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO RUN

1802
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
STRAIGHT TO PSYCHOTHERAPY AFTER

1803
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
A TRAUMA, BUT WHAT VIRTUALLY

1804
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
EVERYBODY NEEDS IS A SOCIAL

1805
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
SUPPORT SYSTEM.

1806
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
AND FOR THESE KIDS, THEIR FELLOW

1807
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
STUDENTS WHO WENT THROUGH THIS

1808
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
WITH THEM, ARE SORT OF NATURAL

1809
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEM.

1810
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
SO I WOULD SAY THAT FIRST AND

1811
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
FOREMOST THE IMPORTANT THING IS

1812
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE

1813
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
KIDS HAS A SOCIAL SUPPORT

1814
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
SYSTEM.

1815
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN

1816
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
INCLUDE EACH OTHER, I THINK THAT

1817
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
THAT'S PROBABLY ON BALANCE MORE

1818
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
OF A BENEFIT.

1819
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
BUT I DON'T THINK IF ONE OF

1820
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
THOSE PARENTS, FOR EXAMPLE,

1821
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
FEELS LIKE THEY NEED TO MOVE OUT

1822
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
OF THAT COMMUNITY, THAT THAT'S

1823
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
SOMEHOW GOING TO, YOU KNOW,

1824
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
PREDISPOSE THEIR CHILD TO BE

1825
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
DAMAGED WORSE IN THE LONG RUN.

1826
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
JENNA: YOU PICK UP ON SOMETHING

1827
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
REALLY IMPORTANT THERE AS WELL

1828
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
BECAUSE SO MANY OF US RIGHT NOW,

1829
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
WE'RE ONLY A FEW DAYS FROM THIS

1830
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
EVENT, AND WE WANT ANSWERS, WE

1831
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
WANT RESOLUTION, YOU WANT

1832
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
JUSTICE WHERE THERE REALLY ISN'T

1833
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
JUSTICE TO BE HAD.

1834
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
TALK TO US ABOUT THAT FEELING

1835
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING

1836
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
IN THE SHORT TERM, MAYBE WHAT WE

1837
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
SHOULD BE EXPECTING IN THE LONG

1838
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
TERM AND HOW TO MAYBE NAVIGATE

1839
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
SOME OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.

1840
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

1841
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS

1842
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
WAS A HORRIFICALLY-EMOTIONAL

1843
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
EVENT.
AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A

1844
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
LOT OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSES.

1845
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
PEOPLE SAYING, OH, WE SHOULD

1846
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
TEAR DOWN THE SCHOOL OR, OH, WE

1847
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
OUGHT TO LIMIT EVERYBODY'S GUN

1848
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
RIGHTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

1849
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
INCLUDING ALL OF THE LAW-ABIDING

1850
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
AMERICANS.
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE EMOTIONAL

1851
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
RESPONSES, THEY'RE

1852
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT WHAT I WOULD

1853
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
SAY TO PEOPLE IS WHAT WE NEED

1854
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
HERE IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THE

1855
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
BEST WE CAN AT SOLVING THESE

1856
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IS REASON.

1857
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
AND EMOTION A LOT OF TIMES IS

1858
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
THE ENEMY OF REASON.

1859
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
SO I WOULD SAY THAT OVER THESE

1860
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
HOLIDAYS SIT WITH THE EMOTION A

1861
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
LITTLE BIT, LET THE EMOTION

1862
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
PASS, AND THEN LET'S TRY TO

1863
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
REALLY REASON THESE THINGS OUT

1864
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
IN THE NEW YEAR.

1865
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
JENNA: MAKES ME HEAR A LITTLE

1866
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
CALM CANNER ALREADY HEARING

1867
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000

1868
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000

IS AND HOW MUCH WE GRIEVE FOR

1870
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
THIS COMMUNITY AS WELL.

1871

WITH NEGOTIATORS REPORTEDLY

1883
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000

AND SPEAKER BOEHNER WRAPPED UP

1893
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
JUST MOMENTS AGO.

1894
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
IT LASTED 45 MINUTES, AND AIDES

1895
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
ARE SAYING WE WILL NOT GET A

1896
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
READOUT, BUT THERE CERTAINLY HAS

1897
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
BEEN A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY ON THE

1898
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
FISCAL CLIFF FRONT.

1899
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
AIDES TO SPEAKER BOEHNER SAY IN

1900
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
A FRIDAY PHONE CALL TO THE

1901
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
PRESIDENT THE SPEAKER OFFERED TO

1902
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
EXTEND THE BUSH TAX CUTS FOR

1903
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
THOSE MAKING UP TO A MILLION

1904
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
DOLLARS SO, THEREFORE, THOSE

1905
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
ABOVE A MILLION DOLLARS WOULD

1906
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
PAY SLIGHTLY HIGHER TAXES IN

1907
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
EXCHANGE FOR SPENDING CUTS AND

1908
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
ENTITLEMENT REFORM.

1909
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

1910
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
FRAMEWORK OF A POSSIBLE FISCAL

1911
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
CLIFF DEAL.

1912
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
IT INCLUDES $1 TRILLION IN CUTS,

1913
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
$1 TRILLION IN NEW REVENUE.

1914
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
THAT WOULD INCLUDE AN IMMEDIATE

1915
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
DOWN PAYMENT AND THEN LAWMAKERS

1916
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
WORKING OUT DETAILS IN THE NEW

1917
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
YEAR.
POSSIBLY INCLUDING RAISING THE

1918
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
NATION'S DEBT LIMIT, SOMETHING

1919
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BADLY

1920
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
WANTED, EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT

1921
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000

PAYROLL TAX CUT AND TAX

1923
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
EXTENDERS.
ANY DEBT LIMIT INCREASE WOULD

1924
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
REQUIRE CUTS B IN REFORMS OF AN

1925
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE

1926
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
INCREASE, FOR THE SPEAKER

1927
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000

OF HIGHER RATES ON THE TABLE ON

1929
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
MILLIONAIRES WAS SEEN AS

1930
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
SIGNIFICANT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PUSHING

1931
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
FOR UPPER INCOME AMERICANS TO

1932
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
PAY HIGHER TAXES.

1933
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
A LEADING HOUSE REPUBLICAN SAYS

1934
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
HE HAS FAITH IN THE SPEAKER.

1935
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000

NIKKI HALEY IS ANNOUNCING THE

1973
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
REPLACEMENT OF OUTGOING

1974
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR JIM DeMINT.

1975
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
>> THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION IS

1976
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
BLESSED.

1977
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
HE WILL LIFT THEM UP TO AN

1978
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
AMAZING NEW LEVEL.

1979
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
IT'S A FOUNDATION I HAVE ALWAYS

1980
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR, AND THEY

1981
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
COULD NOT HAVE MADE A MORE

1982
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
PERFECT PICK.
IN THIS DECISION AND PROCESS

1983
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
THAT WE WENT THROUGH, THERE IS

1984
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
NO REPLACING JIM DeMINT.

1985
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
THERE'S NO REPLACING HIM.

1986
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
THERE'S NO ONE THAT CAN FILL HIS

1987
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
SHOES, THERE'S NO ONE THAT CAN

1988
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
REALLY CARRY ON THAT TORCH.

1989
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
AND I DON'T, I THINK THAT SAYS A

1990
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
LOT ABOUT HIM.

1991
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I THINK IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT HOW

1992
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
HE HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF SOUTH

1993
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
CAROLINA AND THE WAY THAT WE

1994
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF.

1995
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A

1996
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
NEW DAY, AND IT IS, UM, WITH

1997
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
GREAT PLEASURE THAT I AM

1998
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
ANNOUNCING, UM, THAT I AM

1999
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
APPOINTING OUR NEXT U.S. SENATOR

2000
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
TO BE CONGRESSMAN TIM SCOTT.

2001
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
[APPLAUSE]

2002
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WHAT WENT

2003
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
INTO THIS DECISION PROCESS, AND

2004
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE.

2005
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
HE UNDERSTANDS THE STRENGTH THAT

2006
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR BUSINESS

2007
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
COMMUNITY AS WE CONTINUE TO

2008
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
FOCUS ON JOBS.

2009
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
HE HAS SHOWN THAT WITH HIS

2010
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
SUPPORT OF THE PORTS AND KNOWING

2011
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
THAT THE DEEPENING NEEDS TO BE

2012
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
THERE, HE'S SHOWN COURAGE WHEN

2013
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
HE HELPED US WITH THE FIGHT

2014
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
AGAINST NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS

2015
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
BOARD AND THE UNIONS THAT TRIED

2016
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
TO TAKE BOEING DOWN.

2017
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
HE HAS SHOWN IT WITH HIS FISCAL

2018
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
REPRESENTATION AND THE FACT THAT

2019
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
HE KNOWS THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR.

2020
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT EVERY FAMILY

2021
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
AND SMALL BUSINESS GOES THROUGH,

2022
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
AND HE HAS STAYED CONSISTENT TO

2023
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
THAT.

2024
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000

BITLESS OF AN OUTSIDER -- BIT

2142
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000

2160
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
IT'S DOING SOME SOUL SEARCHING

2161
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
AND TRYING TO MAKE INROADS OR

2162
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
LOOKING FOR HOW IT CAN MAKE

2165
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
SO HAVING TIM SCOTT AS A SENATOR

AND ANY HUNDRED OF THESE GUYS

2167
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
CAN MAKE NEWS ON ANY GIVEN DAY

2168
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A SENATOR

2169
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000

2170
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
HELPFUL FOR THE REPUBLICAN

HIM IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

2173
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE TOLD ME

2174
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
THAT I WAS STRUCK WITH IS THAT

2175
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
IT EBB -- THE THINGS WERE A LOT

2176
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
HARDER TO FIX THAN HE IMAGINED,

2177
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
AND I THINK HE ENVISIONSES FOR

2178
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
HIMSELF A VERY LONG POLITICAL

2179
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
CAREER IN WASHINGTON D.C.

2180
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000

OF STATE HE COMES FROM AND HIS

2185
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000

2186
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
LONG AND POSSIBLY BRIGHT FUTURE

2187
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000

2188
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
JON: RIGHT.

2189
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
BECAUSE WE REMEMBER WHEN ROLAND

2191

2193

ABOUT THAT AND, EVENTUALLY, HE

2194
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
SAID, OKAY, I'LL JUST BE A PLACE

2195
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000

2196

2197
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
OUT.

2198
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
GOVERNOR HALEY SAID SHE WAS

2199
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000

2200
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
KEEP THE SEAT, WANTS TO RUN

2201
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000

>> THAT'S CORRECT.

GOVERNOR HALEY IS UP FOR

2203
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
RE-ELECTION IN 2014, I THINK SHE

2204
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO

2205
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
WOULD REFLECT WELL ON HER AND

2206
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
SERVE HER WELL AS A, AS SOMEBODY

2207
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
WHO IS JOINING HER AT THE TOP OF

2208
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
THE TICKET ON THE 2014 BALLOT.

2209
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I ALSO THINK THAT FOR

2210
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
CONSERVATIVES IN SOUTH CAROLINA

2211
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
THIS IS AN APPOINTMENT THAT'S

2212
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
GOING TO SATISFY THEM AND

2213
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
REFLECT WELL ON HER.

2214
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
SHE'S NOT NECESSARILY AT HOME AS

2215
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
WELL LIKED AS SHE IS OUTSIDE

2216
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
SOUTH CAROLINA, SO THIS

2217
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
APPOINTMENT POLITICALLY WAS VERY

2218
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
IMPORTANT FOR HER, AND I THINK

2219
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
SHE DID WHAT SHE NEEDED TO DO,

2220
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
AND I THINK TIM SCOTT SHOULD

2221
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY IN

2222
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
SOUTH CAROLINA AT LEAST AT THIS

2223
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
POINT.
HE COMES FROM CHARLESTON, HE'S

2224
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
GOT STRONG TIES TO THE BUSINESS

2225
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
COMMUNITY THERE, HE'S ALSO

2226
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
STRONG WITH THE TEA PARTY

2227
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
CONSERVATIVE CLASS.

2228
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
AND SO I THINK IT WAS A VERY

2229
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
POLITICALLY WELL-ROUNDED PICK,

2230
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
AND HE'S LIKE BLG.

2231
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
AND SO IF HE DOES HIS JOB, IF HE

2232
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
TRANSITIONS WELL TO THE ROLE OF

2233
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000

2234
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000

2236

2237
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000

WYDEN, CONGRESSMAN ED MARKEY OF

2383
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
MASSACHUSETTS ALL LINING UP IN

2384
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
OPPOSITION ALONG WITH THE DOW

2385
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
CHEMICAL CORPORATION.

2386
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
THESE THREE ARGUING THAT EXPORTS

2387
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
COULD RAISE THE PRICE OF NATURAL

2388
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
GAS DOMESTICALLY AND HURT

2389
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
INDUSTRIES LIKE DOW THAT USE AN

2390
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
AWFUL LOT OF IT.

2391
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
HERE'S WHAT THE CEO SAID ABOUT

2392
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
THAT.
HE SAID, QUOTE: THE REPORT, THE

2393
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY REPORT,

2394
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
OFFERS THE BAF LING CONCLUSION

2395
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
THAT THE U.S. WOULD BE BETTER

2396
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
OFF USING ITS DOMESTIC NATURAL

2397
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
GAS ADVANTAGE TO FUEL GROWTH AND

2398
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
JOBS IN OTHER REGIONS VERSUS

2399
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
STRENGTHENING THE U.S. ECONOMY

2400
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
ASK THROUGH MANUFACTURING AND

2401
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
BENEFITING CONSUMERS WITH LOWER

2402
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
ENERGY COSTS.
THAT BROUGHT THIS REACTION FROM

2403
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.

2404
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
>> WHAT'S GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE

2405
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
GANDER.
IF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY WANTS

2406
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
THE FREE MARKET TO WORK SO THEY

2407
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
CAN PRODUCE PRODUCT AND EXPORT

2408
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
IT, WE SHOULD APPLY THE SAME

2409
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
STANDARD TO THE NATURAL GAS AND

2410
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
OIL INDUSTRY.

2411
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
>> Reporter: SO HOW MUCH

2412
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
NATURAL GAS DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE?

2413
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE INDUSTRY,

2414
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
ABOUT 900 YEARS -- 100 YEARS'

2415
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
WORTH, SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE

2416
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
U.S. COULD BECOME ENERGY

2417
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
SELF-SUFFICIENT WITHIN THE NEXT

2418
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
FEW YEARS.

2419
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
THE CURRENT PRICE OF MATCH ALGAS

2420
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
IS ABOUT $3.43 PER MILLION BTU.

2421
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

2422
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
ENERGY REPORT, EXPORTING NATURAL

2423
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
GAS COULD RAISE THAT PRICE BY

2424
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
MORE THAN A DOLLAR OVER THE NEXT

2425
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
FIVE YEARS WHICH, JENNA,

2426
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
INDUSTRY SAYS IT JUST DOESN'T

2427
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
WANT TO SEE HAPPEN.

2428
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
JENNA: ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT

2429
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
STORY, JOHN.

2430
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
THANK YOU.

2431
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000

TO HELP IN THE RECOVERY EFFORT

2435
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
AFTER SUPERSTORM SANDY.

2436
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
WHY SOME LAWMAKERS ARE CALLING

2437
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
THE $60 BILLION PRICE TAG

2438
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
ABSURDLY HIGH.

2439
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
>>> AND IT SEEMS EVERY DAY WE'RE

2440
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
GETTING REPORTS OF ESCALATING

2441
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
VIOLENCE IN SYRIA, BUT IT'S

2442
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
OFTEN DIFFICULT TO GET FIRSTHAND

2443
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
INFORMATION.
STRAIGHT AHEAD, WE'LL TALK WITH

2444
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
A FREELANCE JOURNALIST WHO JUST

2445

THE STORM.

2488
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE SLAMMING

01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
PET PROJECTS TACKED ONTO THE

PET PROJECTS SAYING THEY

SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING BILL

2501
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000

WITH DEMOCRATS IN CONTROL

2505
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
AND NATURE OF THE HARDSHIP

2506
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY

2507
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
AND PRESSURE PUT ON LAWMAKER

2508
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
BY HOME STATE GOVERNORS

2509
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT OF ITS

2510
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
PASSAGE.

2511
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
>> THIS IS A TREMENDOUS NEED

2512
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
FOR THE STATE.

THE DAMAGE.

2515
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
WHICH IS JUST DEVASTATING.

2516
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
PEOPLE ARE STILL REELING

2517
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
FROM THIS TRAUMA.

2518
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
AND NEW YORK NEEDS HELP AND

2519
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
NEW YORK HAS BEEN THERE FOR

2520
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

2521
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
WHEN THEY HAVE NEEDED HELP

2522
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000

01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
DIFFERENT STORY IN THE HOUSE
WHERE REPUBLICANS INDICATED

2525
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
THAT FEMA HAS ENOUGH MONEY

2526
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
IN RESERVES TO LAST THROUGH

2527
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000

SPENDING CUTS THAT DRAWN THE

01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
IRE OF DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS

2536
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
IN BOTH HOUSES.

2537
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
>> WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

2538
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
ABOUT THE POLITICAL

2539
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING THIS

2540
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
DONE.
WE KNOW IT IS NOT GOING TO

2541
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
BE EASY.
>> Reporter: CRITICS OF THE

WILLY-NILLY AT A PROBLEM

2547
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000

TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICITS

2556
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
THIS IS AN ACT OF WILLFUL

2557
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
FENCE.
THEY WILL NEED SEVEN

01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
REPUBLICAN VOTES IN THE

2559
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
SENATE TO MOVE THIS.

2560
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THEY WILL

2561
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE.

2562
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
JENNA: DOUG, KEEP US

PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP

THERE.

2570
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
THE ATTACK KILLING AT LEAST

2571
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
EIGHT PEOPLE, SPARKING A

2572
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
MASSIVE NEW EXODUS OF

2573
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000

2578
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT

2579
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
REFUGEE CAMP WAS USED BY THE

2580
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
OPPOSITION AND REBELS TO

2581
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
STAGE ATTACKS FROM.

2582
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING

2583
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
INSIDE OF SYRIA RIGHT NOW.

2584
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
THIS IS INSURGENCY CIVIL

2585
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
WAR.
THE REBELS ARE AMONG THE

2586
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
PEOPLE.

2587
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HAVING

2588
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
THESE LARGE-SCALE ARTILLERY

2589
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
ATTACKS AND AIR ATTACKS ON

2590
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
CIVILIAN POPULATION.

2591
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
THE RESULTS OF THOSE COULD

2592
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
BE CATASTROPHIC.

2593
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
AND CAUSED A NUMBER OF

2594
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
CASUALTIES IN THE REFUGEE

2595
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
CAMP AND OTHER PLACES

2596
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
CREATING THIS EXODUS OF

2597
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
SYRIAN CIVILIANS.

2598
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
THE DEATH TOLL IN SYRIA WELL

2599
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
ABOVE 40,000.

2600
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
OVER A MILLION PEOPLE ARE

2601
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
DISPLACED.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE

2602
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
FLED OUTSIDE OF THEIR

2603
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
COUNTRY BUT IT COMES AT AN

2604
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
INTERESTING TIME HERE AS THE

2605
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
SYRIAN REBELS ARE BEGINNING

2606
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
TO GAIN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

2607
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
LITTLE BIT OF THE UPPER HAND

2608
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
IN THIS BATTLE.

2609
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
THE NOOSE IS TIGHTENING

2610
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
AROUND DAMASCUS.

2611
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
THE FIGHTING IS MOVING FROM

2612
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
THE OUTLYING COUNTRY AREAS

2613
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
IN TOWARDS THE CAPITAL AND

2614
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
IN TOWARDS THE LARGER

2615
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
CITIES.
THE REBELS ARE BRINGING THE

2616
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
FIGHT TO THE GOVERNMENT

2617
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
RATHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT
BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER THE

2618
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
REBELS.
THE REBELS ARE BECOMING

2619
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
INCREASINGLY BETTER ARMED.

2620
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
VIDEO OUT OF SYRIA CERTAINLY

2621
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
SHOWS THAT.

2622
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
THEIR ATTACKS ARE BETTER

2623
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
COORDINATED.

2624
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
THEIR ATTACKS ARE MORE

2625
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
SUCCESSFUL.

2626
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE

2627
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
REASONS THE SYRIAN VICE

2628
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
PRESIDENT JUST SAID IN THE

2629
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
PAST COUPLE DAYS HE DOESN'T

2630
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
THINK THEY CAN ACTUALLY BEAT

2631
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
THE SYRIAN REBELS AS THE

2632
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
GOVERNMENT.

2633
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THAT MAY BE THE FIRST SIGN

2634
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME IS WILLING

2635
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
TO NEGOTIATE.

2636
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
JON?
JON: THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

THANK YOU.
JENNA: NORMALLY WHEN WE TALK

2640
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
ABOUT SYRIA WE HAVE TO OFFER

2641
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
A DISCLAIMER TO BE

2642
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
RESPONSIBLE JUNENALISTS WHEN

01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
IS AMATEUR VIDEO AND DON'T

2645
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
HAVE A CLEAR SOURCE.

2646
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
WE TODAY DO.

2647
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
WE HAVE VIDEO FROM A

2648
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
FREELANCE JOURNALIST,

01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
CHRISTIE WILCOX, WHO SPENT

2650
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
THREE MONTHS TRAVELING

2651
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
THROUGH SYRIA TO GET A LOOK

2652
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
AT THE CIVIL WAR.

2653
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000

2654
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
UNITED STATES AND JOINS US

2656
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
CHRISTIE, TELL US WHEN AND

2657
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
HOW YOU DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO

2658
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
SYRIA?

2659
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A

2660
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
LONG PROCESS, A LONG

2661
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
DECISION IN THE MAKING.

2662
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE, I'M A

2663
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
BIG FAN OF TRAVELING

2664
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
INTERNATIONALLY AND

2665
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOT

2666
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
OF CHAOS GOING ON IN SYRIA

2667
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
RIGHT NOW AND I BELIEVED

2668
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
THAT THEIR STORY NEEDED TO
BE TOLD.
SO THAT WAS A MAIN REASON

2669
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
FOR ME GOING OVERCEASE.

2670
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
JENNA: LELAND MENTIONED AN

2671
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
ATTACK ON A REFUGEE CAMP.

2672
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
YOU SPENT TIME VIDEOTAPING

2673
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
REFUGEES IN THE AREA.

2674
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
WE HAVE SOME OF VIDEO.

2675
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT

2676
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
ABOUT THAT?
>> YEAH.

2677
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE

2678
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
REFUGEE CAMP JUST OVER THE

2679
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
SYRIAN BORDER.

2680
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
WHEN I WAS THERE IN AUGUST

2681
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING
THERE.

2682
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
IN THE MOST RECENT MONTHS,

2683
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
YOU'RE SEEING THOUSANDS OF

2684
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
REFUGEES, INTERNALLY

2685
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
DISPLACED PEOPLE COMING FROM

2686
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
INSIDE SYRIA OUT TO THESE

2687
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
REFUGEE CAMPS BECAUSE THEY

2688
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY.

2689
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD.

2690
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
THEY DON'T HAVE WATER.

2691
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET

2692
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
FED.

2693
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND

2694
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
SAFETY.
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

2695
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE

2696
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
REFUGEE CAMP, ESPECIALLY

2697
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
LOOKING AT THE BOMBARDMENTS

2698
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
IS, YOU KNOW, THE, WITH THE

2699
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
NO-FLY ZONE NOT BEING

2700
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
ACCESSIBLE THERE, THEY'RE

2701
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
GOING AND THEY'RE BOMBING

2702
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
SOME OF THESE TENTS.

2703
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
SO WHEN YOU HAVE THOUSANDS

2704
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE

2705
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
REFUGEE CAMP WITH NO PLACE

2706
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
TO STAY, THEY'RE FORCED TO

2707
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
GO BACK INTO THE POPULATION

2708
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
AS WELL.
JENNA: ONE OF THE OTHER

2709
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
VIDEO ITEMS THAT WE HAVE,

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
VIDEO CLIPS THAT YOU SHOT

2711
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
BRINGS US OUTSIDE OF ALEPPO.

2712
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
THAT IS A CITY WE TALKED A

2713
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
LOT ABOUT AND THE BACK AND

2714
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
FORTH WITH REBEL FORCES

2715
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
THERE, WHO WE CALL THE REBEL

2716
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
FORCES, AS WELL AS THE

2717
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
GOVERNMENT.
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

2718
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE AND

2719
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
WHAT YOUR SENSE IS OF THE

2720
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
QUOTE, UNQUOTE REBELS THAT

2721
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
ARE FIGHTING THIS WAR?

2722
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
>> WELL IT WAS A REALLY

2723
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
INTERESTING COMMUNITY.

2724
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
THE COMMUNITY IS ALBAB.

2725
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
IT SITS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF

2726
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
ALEPPO.
WHEN IT WAS LIBERATED IT WAS

2727
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE

2728
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
RAMADAN.

2729
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
THEY BOMBED A HOSPITAL KNOWN

2730
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
FOR KID ANY TRANSPLANTS THAT

2731
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
SITS UP ON THE HILL.

2732
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS

2733
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
CREATE A LITTLE NORMALCY OUT

2734
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
OF LIVING AN ABNORMAL LIFE.

2735
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
THE VIDEO YOU'RE SEEING HERE

2736
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
IS THE HOSPITAL THAT HAS

2737
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
BEEN BOMBED.

2738
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
WHAT THEY DID, THEY TOOK THE

2739
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
PEOPLE IN THIS HOSPITAL AND

2740
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
CREATED KIND OF A MAKESHIFT

2741
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
AREA INSIDE SOME OF THE

2742
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
MOSQUES WHERE THEY WOULD

2743
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
TAKE, YOU KNOW, THE

2744
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
OPPOSITION FIGHTERS.

2745
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
THEY WOULD TAKE CIVILIANS

2746
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED AND

2747
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
THEY WOULD PUT THEM IN THERE

2748
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
AND, YOU KNOW, AT TIMES

2749
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE ENOUGH

2750
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
MEDICAL STAFF, ENOUGH

2751
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
TREATMENT FACILITIES INSIDE

2752
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
THESE, THESE FACILITIES,

2753
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
MAKESHIFT FACILITIES THAT

2754
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

2755
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
DEVELOPED.

2756
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
JENNA: WE'RE SHOWING SOME OF
THAT FOOTAGE AS WELL.

2757
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
FINAL VIDEO YOU BROUGHT US,

2758
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
AGAIN WE'RE SO GRATEFUL TO

2759
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
GET SOME OF YOUR INSIGHTS ON

2760
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
THIS.
JUST ON FRIDAY WE LEARNED

2761
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
THERE WAS A DECISION MADE

2762
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
SOME NATO TROOPS INCLUDING

2763
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
AMERICAN TROOPS WILL BE SENT

2764
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
TO THE BORDER BETWEEN TURKEY

2765
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
AND SYRIA AS WELL AS PATRIOT

2766
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
MISSILES.

2767
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
THAT IS WHERE YOU SPENT A

2768
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
LOT OF YOUR TIME.

2769
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
TELL US ABOUT THE BORDER.

2770
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
HOW VULNERABLE IS IT?

2771
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
WHAT WILL THESE TROOPS

2772
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
CONFRONT?

2773
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, AT THIS

2774
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
POINT I THINK IT'S JUST THE

2775
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
RIGHT THING FOR THE AMERICAN

2776
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
GOVERNMENT TO DO.

2777
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I MEAN WE'VE SEEN SO MUCH

2778
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
BOMBARDMENT.
WHEN I WAS ON THE BORDER,

2779
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
THIS VIDEO YOU'RE SEEING IS

2780
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
WHERE THE ORIGINAL SPILLOVER

2781
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
WAS STARTING TO TAKE PLACE.

2782
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
THIS IN THE PLACE WHERE THE

2783
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
REBELS ARE GEARING UP TO

2784
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
FIGHT AGAINST THE SYRIAN

2785
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE

2786
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
WERE REALLY SCARED, YOU KNOW,

2787
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
THE TOWN IN WHERE THE

2788
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
SPILLOVER WAS HAPPENING, THE

2789
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS

2790
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
HITTING THEM VERY, VERY HARD

2791
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
AND IT WAS LEAKING OVER TO

2792
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
THE TOWN NEXT TO IT IN

2793
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
TURKEY.

2794
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
SO, YOU KNOW, IT IS ONLY

2795
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
RIGHT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

2796
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
DEFEND THEMSELVES.

2797
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I MEAN, I THINK THE ONE

2798
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
THING THAT TURKEY DID REALLY

2799
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
WELL WAS THEY STEPPED UP

2800
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND THEY

2801
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
SAID, THIS IS WHAT IS

2802
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
ACCEPTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT

2803
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, WHICH IS

2804
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
THE REASON WHY THE REGIME

2805
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
BACKED OFF FROM THE GET-GO.

2806
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO

2807
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
CONTINUE TO DO IS TO SUPPORT

2808
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
OUR ALLIES.

2809
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
JENNA: VERY INTERESTING

APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

2816
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
>> THANKS, JENNA, LET'S HOPE

2817
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
THEY GET THAT WAR OVER WITH

2818
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
SOON.

2819
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
AN OVERSEAS COMPANY FACES

2820
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
AMERICAN JUSTICE, FOUND

2821
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
LIABLE FOR CAUSING POLLUTION

2822
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE

2823
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
RAMIFICATIONS AND SHOW YOU

2824
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING.

2825
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
>> STILL AHEAD THE

2826
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
INVESTIGATION INTO THE

2827
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

2828
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
PICKING UP SPEED AS WE LEARN

2829
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE GUNMAN

2830
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
AND HIS FAMILY LIFE.

2831
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
JENNA: OUT TO NEWTOWN,

2832
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
CONNECTICUT, AND THE LATEST

2833
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
PRESS BRIEFING.
LET'S GO AHEAD AND LISTEN

2834
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000

2835
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
OF THAT FACILITY

2836
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
INDEFINITELY.
IN DOING SO WE'RE GOING TO,

2837
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
AT THIS TIME, ALLOW THE

2838
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM TO MOVE THE

2839
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
FURNITURE TO THE NEXT

2840
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
LOCATION, THE BUILDING THAT

2841
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED TO

2842
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
CONTINUE THE EDUCATION OF

2843
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
THE CHILDREN, K-4.

2844
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
THAT INFORMATION WILL COME

2845
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
FROM THE BOARD OF EDUCATION

2846
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
AND THE SCHOOL

2847
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
SUPERINTENDENT AS

2848
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
APPROPRIATE ON THEIR WEBSITE.

2849
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
WE ARE STILL GUARDING AND

2850
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
WE'LL STILL CONTINUE TO

2851
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
GUARD BOTH SCENES AS CRIME

2852
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
SCENES AS WE'VE INDICATED

2853
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
THIS MORNING.

2854
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
AGAIN, THAT WILL, THAT WILL

2855
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
GO ON INDEFINITELY.

2856
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
REGARDING FUNERAL SERVICES,

2857
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
AS YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING

2858
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
PLANNED AND PUBLICIZED BY

2859
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
THE FAMILIES AT FUNERAL

2860
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
HOMES.

2861
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
A COUPLE THINGS WE WANT TO

2862
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
RESTATE.

2863
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
EACH FAMILY HAS LIAISON

2864
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
TROOPER THAT WILL MAINTAIN

2865
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
CONTACT AND BE WITH THEM.

2866
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
IN ADDITION NEWTOWN AND

2867
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
STATE POLICE AND SURROUNDING

2868
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE

2869
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
PLANNING ASSISTANCE TO EACH

2870
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
FUNERAL SERVICE, SO IT GOES

2871
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
UNSCATHED.
I HAVE TO ASK AND PLEAD,

2872
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
LITERALLY THE WORD IS PLEAD,

2873
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING.

2874
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
MANY OF THE FAMILIES HAVE

2875
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
ASKED THAT TO PLEASE AFFORD

2876
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
THEM THEIR PRIVACY AS THEY

2877
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
GO THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE,

2878
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT

2879
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
THEY'RE DEALING WITH.

2880
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I'VE BEEN ASKED, THE

2881
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
LIEUTENANT WITH ME, HAS BEEN

2882
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
ASKED TO PASS THAT ON TO YOU

2883
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
AS CLEARLY AND CONCISELY AS

2884
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
POSSIBLE.

2885
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
THAT IS THE BEST WAY I CAN

2886
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
DO IT.

2887
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
>> AT THIS TIME I CAN TAKE A

2888
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

2889
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN CLEAR UP

2890
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
ANYTHING.
THEN I'M GOING TO SPEAK A

2891
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR FUTURE

2892
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,000
GET-TOGETHERS.

2893
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
>> [INAUDIBLE].

2894
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
>> CORRECT.

2895
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
GOING TO ASK ME A HARD

2896
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
QUESTION AND I'M TRYING TO

2897
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
RECALL.

2898
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
THERE WERE TWO PHONE CALLS.

2899
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
THE QUESTION WAS, ABOUT THE,

2900
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
THERE WERE TWO THREATS OF

2901
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
VIOLENCE.

2902
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
WE CAN SIMPLY SAY THEY CAME

2903
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
IN TWO SEPARATE PHONE CALLS

2904
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
AGAINST THE SAME FACILITY

2905
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
WHICH WAS THE CHURCH, THE

2906
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN TOWN.

2907
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
TWO TELEPHONE CALLS

2908
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
RECEIVED.

2909
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
AGAIN, AS I STATED BEFORE,

2910
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
THOSE ARE CRIMINAL ACTS.

2911
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
THOSE ARE ACTS BEING

2912
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY

2913
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
INVESTIGATED AND FOLLOW-UP

2914
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
WILL BE DONE BY EITHER STATE

2915
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
AND OR FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

2916
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
RELATIVE TO ANY THREATS OF

2917
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
THAT NATURE THAT SOMEONE SET

2918
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
FORTH.

2919
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
THOSE ARE THE, WHAT I MEANT

2920
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
BY THE THREATS, OKAY?

2921
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
NEXT PLEASE.

2922
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
>> HOW MUCH TRAINING DO YOU

2923
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
THINK THE SUSPECT HAD?

2924
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
ARE YOU AWARE OR ANY

2925
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
INDICATION OR WHERE HE WAS

2926
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
PRACTICING?

2927
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
>> CERTAINLY, I CAN'T EVEN

2928
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
BEGIN TO SPECULATE.

2929
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THAT

2930
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO

2931

01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
THAT IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT

2950
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
TO RECOVER ANYTHING?

2951
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000

IT IS A VERY PAINSTAKING

2961
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
PROCESS IN FORENSIC SCIENCE.

2962
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000

AS I SAID, THIS MORNING,

WAS BUILT TO THE DAY WE

3037
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000

EVEN REMOTELY APPEARS TO BE

3116
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
A LACK OF SECURITY OR BREACH

3117
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
OF SECURITY, ANY EDUCATIONAL

3118
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
INSTITUTION IN CONNECTICUT

3119
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
AND I'M SURE IN SURROUNDING

3120
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
STATES AND ACROSS THE

3121
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
COUNTRY WILL BE TREATED,

3122
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY.

3123
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
THERE WAS A REPORT THIS

3124
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
MORNING WHERE THERE WAS

3125
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL IN

3126
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE OF

3127
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
THE SCHOOLS.

3128
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT

3129
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND

3130
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
CLEARED THE MATTER.

3131
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
IT WAS NOT A THREAT, BUT IN

3132
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
DOING SO THEY DID PUT NEARBY

3133
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
SCHOOLS IN LOCKDOWN, SIMPLY

3134
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
AS A PRECAUTION.

3135
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I DO KNOW ACROSS THE STATE,

3136
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
THE GOVERNOR AND EDUCATION

3137
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
COMMISSIONER AND LOCAL

3138
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL

3139
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
OFFICIALS ARE PUTTING A

3140
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA

3141
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
SECURITY.
WE'RE SUPPORTING THE

3142
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

3143
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF
CONNECTICUT.

3144
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
WE'RE CERTAINLY, AS YOU WELL

3145
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000

3146
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
WELL-TRAINED.

THE FACULTY ARE WELL-TRAINED,

3148
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
ALL THE PERSONNEL IN THE

3149
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
SCHOOL ARE WELL-TRAINED.

3150
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
THEY PRACTICE FOR FIRE

3151
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
DRILLS, FOR EMERGENCIES AND

3152
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
BELIEF ME THE BLANKET OF

3153
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
PUBLIC SECURITY WILL BE

3154
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
STRICT IN THE STATE OF

3155
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
CONNECTICUT.

NEEDED TO HOLD A PRESS

3178
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
CONFERENCE AND IT WOULD HAVE

3179
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000

3193
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
BE SMARTEST AND BEST WAY.

3194
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000

3196
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
>> SINCE MIGHT BE A LONG

3197
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
TIME TO GET A CHANCE TO TALK

3198
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
TO YOU.

3199
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
>> YES, SIR.

01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
KEY QUESTION WE ASK YOU ALL

01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
THE TIME.

3202
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
YOU KEEP REFERRING TO, CAN

3203
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
YOU GIVE PEOPLE GUIDANCE AND

3204
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE

3205
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
WONDERING HOW LONG IT MIGHT

3206
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
TAKE AND WHY IT TAKES SO

3207
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
LONG AND HOW LONG WILL WE

3208
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE YOU COME

3209
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
UP AND TELL JUST SO WE HAVE

3210
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
SOME IDEA?

3211
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
HUNDREDS OF INTERVIEWS,

3212
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
FILING EACH PIECE OF

3213
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
EVIDENCE ON EVERY TRAIL THAT

3214
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
IT GUESS IT WILL TAKE

3215
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME,

3216
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I KNOW, WE KNOW AS

3217
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
INVESTIGATORS, THAT THE

3218
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
PEOPLE, CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE

3219
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
OF THIS TOWN OF NEWTOWN,

3220
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

3221
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT.

3222
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THEM

3223
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
ANY INFORMATION AT ALL

3224
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
INFORMATION.

3225
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
WE'LL PAINT A CRYSTAL CLEAR

3226
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
PICTURE AS MUCH AS WE

3227
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
POSSIBLY CAN.
BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS.

3228
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
IT IS NOT SOMETHING JUST

3229
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
DONE IN 60 MINUTES AS YOU

3230
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
SEE ON TV.

3231
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
WE'LL KEEP THE PUBLIC

3232
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
INFORMED.

3233
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THERE

3234
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
IS ANYTHING THAT IS EMERGENT,

3235
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
THAT WE GET IT OUT

3236
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
IMMEDIATELY AND IT'S THROUGH

3237
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
YOU FOLKS.

3238
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE.

3240
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN VERY

3241
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
PROFESSIONAL AND WE DO

3242
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

3243
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
THANK YOU

3244
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
JENNA: A FEW THINGS WE

3245
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
SHOULD REVIEW WITH YOU, THAT

3246
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
CAME TO LIGHT BASED ON WHAT

3247
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
HE TOLD US.

3248
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
THERE SHOULD BE A VIDEO HOUR

3249
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
AGO OF LARGE MOVING TRUCKS

3250
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
THAT CAME TO THE ELEMENTARY

3251
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
SCHOOL.

3252
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
WE WEREN'T SURE WHY THEY

3253
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
WERE THERE.

3254
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
WERE THEY COLLECTING

3255
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
EVIDENCE, WAS SOMETHING ELSE

3256
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
GOING ON?

3257
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
THE LIEUTENANT TELLING US

3258
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
SOME OF THAT FURNITURE IS

3259
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
BEING MOVED.

3260
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
POTENTIALLY SOME OF THESE
STUDENTS FROM SANDY HOOK,

3261
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

3262
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
GRADERS MAY YOU WERE RETURN

3263
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
TO A BUILDING SOMEWHERE IN

3264
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
THE AREA.
THEY WILL SET UP A MAKESHIFT

3265
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
SCHOOL, IF YOU WILL, AND

3266
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
PERHAPS THAT IS WHERE SOME

3267
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
OF THE FURNITURE IS GOING.

3268
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
JON: HARD TO IMAGINE THEY

3269
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
WOULD REOPEN THAT SCHOOL.

3270
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
CERTAINLY NOT IN ITS CURRENT

3271
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
CONFIGURATION.

3272
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
THAT IS DECISION TO BE LEFT

3273
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
DOWN THE ROAD AFTER

3274
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
COLUMBINE.

3275
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
THEY MADE SOME CHANGES IN

3276
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
THE PHYSICAL FACILITIES

3277
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
THERE.
DID A LOT OF REMODELING BUT

3278
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

3279
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
WHERE SUCH HORRORS HAVE

3280
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
TAKEN PLACE, THERE ARE MANY

3281
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
BIG DECISIONS AHEAD.

3282
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
JENNA: WE SHOULD MENTION
THERE WILL BE ARMED GUARDS

3283
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
ON THAT PROPERTY.
IT IS A CRIME SCENE
