00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AS WE SETTLED DOWN FOR LUNCH, I

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
REALIZED THERE WERE PREDATORS

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
OUT THERE THAT MIGHT WANT TO

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
TAKE A BIG BITE OUT OF US.

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
ARE WE SAFE FROM POLAR BEARS IN

191
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HERE?

192
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
>> SOMETIMES YOU ARE, BUT THEY

193
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
CAN BREAK THROUGH. THEY'RE

194
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
LOOKING FOR SEALS, SO THIS IS '

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
MUCH LIKE A SEAL'S DEN.

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> THEY CAN BREAK THROUGH HERE?

197
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> OH, YES.

198

STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR
THE NIGHT.

200
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
BEGAN--BRAVING THE ELEMENTS AND

202
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000

A TURTLE WORLD.

SO I TOOK CONTROL
AND STEERED US THROUGH IT.

APPROACHED, AND AS OUR EYES MET

FATTEN THEMSELVES UP. AND SO

326
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE BABIES.

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000

AWAITS. INSTEAD OF PUTTING ON MY

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000

It just wouldn't go away.

393
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000

widespread pain.

396

Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

397
