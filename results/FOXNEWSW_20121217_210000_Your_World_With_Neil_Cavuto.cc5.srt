THE INVESTIGATORS WILL DETERMINE

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
HOW, WHEN, WHERE AND WHY WE WILL

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
DO THIS.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000

SECRET SERVICE AGENT SAYS COULD

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SAVE LIVES.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
MANY ARE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THIS.
EASEEASIER SAID THAN DONE.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
>> WOULD YOU RATHER A SITUATION

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
YOUR CHILD IS IN SCHOOL AND AN

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
AMENDED GUNMAN CONFRONTS SOMEONE

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
UNARMED OR ARMED.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT TURNING

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THE SCHOOLS INTO ARMED CAMPS BUT

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THERE IS A REASON WE HAVE ARMED

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SECURITY GUARDS AT BANKS, THEY

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
ATTRACT AN ELEMENT THAT THE

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BANGS DO NOT WANT.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SCHOOLS HAVE NOW

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
BECOME A MAGNET FOR THIS TYPE OF

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ACTIVITY.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
>>Neil: I WONDER ABOUT OTHER

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SCHOOLS WHERE THEY DID HAVE

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
PROCEDURES IN PLACE, INCLUDING

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THIS ONE, BUZZING THE GUESTS IN,

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND ALL SORTS SAFETY SYSTEMS

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THAT WOULD AT LEAST DETER BAD

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
GUYS FROM DOING SOMETHING.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IF YOU ARE LOADED FOR BEAR AND

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
YOU HAVE WEAPONS, THOSE SYSTEMS

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
ARE A MOOT POINT UNLESS YOU DO

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ARM SOMEONE.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>>Guest: RIGHT, AND I DON'T

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WANT TO OPEN UP A WOUND THAT IT

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
COULD BE SLOWLY STARTING TO HEAL

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THIS IS DEVASTATING, BUT ARE WE

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY?

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WHAT IS A BUZZING SYSTEM REALLY

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DOING IF MOST OF THE

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
PERPETRATORS WHO COMMIT THE

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
CRIMES ARE PEOPLE KNOWN TO THE

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SCHOOL THIS I PUT OUT A RELEASE

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
TODAY REGARDING A SERVICE, A

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SECRET SERVICE STUDY IN

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OF EDUCATION AND OVER

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WOMENNINGLY THEY ARE --

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OVERWHELMINGLY THEY ARE PEOPLE

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
NONE BY THE SCHOOLS.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THE SECRET SERVICE DOES THIS ALL

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THE TIME, DISCREET SECURITY.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
PRESIDENT WITH ARMED GUARDS.

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
BUT HE IS OUT OF THERE SAFE.

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THIS.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
>>Neil: WHAT ABOUT A SYSTEM IN

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
PLACE THAT TRIES TO MAKE SURE

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE,

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
YOU ARE SCREENING PEOPLE.

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
IN OTHER WORDS, WHETHER METAL

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DETECTORS OR THE LIKE,

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AUTHORITIES AT THE SCHOOL KNEW

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THIS BOY, HE WAS A FORMER

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
STUDENT, AND, OF COURSE, FROM

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
EVERY INDICATION HE SHOT HIS WAY

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
IN THERE AND WHAT WE ARE TOLD

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
HAD HIS WAY, BUT, HOW DO YOU

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MAKE SURE THAT EVEN THOSE WITH

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
WHOM YOU ARE FAMILIAR ARE

161
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SCREENED?
>>Guest: WELL THE PROBLEM WITH

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE SCHOOL UNLIKE AN AIRPORT,

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THE GOAL IN AN AIRPORT IS TO GET

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TO A PLANE, THE GOAL OF THE

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SCHOOL IS JUST TO GET IN THE

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SCHOOL.

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
YOU WILL NOT SHOOT THE OPERATOR

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OF THE EQUIPMENT AT THE AIRPORT,

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
BUT SOMEONE AT THE SCHOOL WILL

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
NOT GO THROUGH THE METAL

171
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
DETECTOR.

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
YOUR POINT IS VALID BUT WITH WE

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
HAVE TO LOOK AT IS WHAT WE CALL

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AT THE SECRET SERVICE, HOW DO WE

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
HARDEN THEM UP?

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
WHEN SOMEONE IS COMMITTED AND

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
STOPPED, THEY ARE BUZZED IN,

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THEY HAVE ELIMINATED ANYONE IN

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THEIR WAY AND THEY ARE THE

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HALLWAY, WHAT DO WE DO TO HARDEN

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE CLASSROOM AND HOW DO WE MAKE

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE BIG SCHOOL, OR A BIG BOX A

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SMALL BOX?

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A LOT OF SECURE SMALL BOXES SO

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THEY CAN HARDEN UP THE

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000

NOT.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I HAVE BEEN ASKED THAT QUESTION

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
BEFORE AND THE ENTIRE TIME THAT

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000

HIGH SCHOOL, I CAN ASSURE YOU HE

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
WASN'T.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
HE COULD HAVE BECOME A VICTIM

279
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND THAT IS WHY HE HAD SO MUCH

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
CARE GIVEN TO HIM.

281
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000

>>Guest: VIDEO PRODUCTION.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
WE RAN A LOCAL ACCESS NETWORK,

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
EDUCATIONAL NETWORK.

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WE REPUBLICAN A RADIO STATION

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THROUGH THAT SAME NETWORK.

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
WE WENT TO THE TOWN PEOPLE IN

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THE DIRECT AND THROUGH CABLE

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
NETWORK SO WE DID VIDEO

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
PRODUCTION ON A LARGE SCALE, NOT

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
AS BIG AS HERE BUT IT WAS A LOT

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
OF FUN AND IT DREW IN A LOT OF

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
CHILDREN THAT LOVED TECHNOLOGY

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SO TECHNOLOGY, TODAY, INCLUDES

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
VIDEO PRODUCTION ON COMPUTER

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
SOFTWARE AND ED SITTING -- ED

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SITTING BOARDS AND CABLE WIRING

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
AND LIGHTING ISSUES.

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
HE WAS INVOLVED IN ALL OF THAT.

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
>>Neil: WAS HE GOOD AT IT?

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
>>Guest: HE WAS GOOD AT IT.

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HE WAS ENCOURAGED TO COME UP TO

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THE HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH A

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
PROGRAM THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
WHERE WE WOULD GO TO THE MIDDLE

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
SCHOOL LOOKING FOR RECRUITS THAT

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
WOULD BE COMING TO THE HIGH

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
SCHOOL AND THAT IS MY FIRST

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000

ADAM.
>>Neil: YOU KNEW HIS MOTHER.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>>Guest: I DID.

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
>>Imus: HE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
CONCERN, YOURS AND OTHERS,

315
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
EXPRESSED ABOUT NOT HIS BEHAVIOR

316
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
BUT HIS RECLUSIVENESS, AND THE

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
MOTHER WOULD COME TO THE SCHOOL

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
TO ADDRESS THEM WITH THE SCHOOL

319
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
AUTHORITIES, OR WHAT, EXACT

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
HAPPEN?

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
>>Guest: YES, I HAVE SAID MORE

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
LIKE AN EPISODE WHERE HIS

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
CONDITION WORSENED AND HE

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
WITHDREW INTO HIMSELF.

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IN OTHER WORDS, HIS INABILITY TO

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
COMMUNICATE WOULD GET WORSE OR

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
TO SHARE WHAT HE WAS FEELING

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WOULD BE WORSE.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
MRS. LANZA WAS A WONDERFUL

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
PARENT WHO OFTEN WAS ON CAMPUS

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FOR HER SON.

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
>>Neil: NOW THE PARENT WOULD

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
HAVE BEEN DIVORCED AT THIS TIME.

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SO HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS MOM AT

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THIS TIME, IS THAT CORRECT?

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
>>Guest: WHICH TIME?

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>>Neil: WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH

338
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
SCHOOL?

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>>Guest: NO, HIS FAMILY WAS

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TOGETHER.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>>Neil: THEY WERE TOGETHER AT

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THAT TIME.
>>Guest: MY BELIEVE IS THEY

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WERE, YES.

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN GOING, THEY

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF FAMILY

346
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
DYSFUNCTION AS FAR AS BETWEEN

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
THE HUSBAND AND WIFE THAT THE

348
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000

349
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
SCHOOL SETTING AND SOME MAY SAY

350
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
THEY ARE NOT DOING THE MATH OR

351
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
ENGLISH AND WHY YOUR GRADES GO

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
FROM 90'S TO F AND A LOT OF KIDS

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
SHOW THAT WITH A DIVORCE OR

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
DIFFICULTY IN THE HOME.

355
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THERE WAS SOME TALK AND YOU CAN

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
SENSE IF YOU ARE THAT CLOSE TO

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THE KIDS, WHAT IS GOING ON, IT

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
COULD BE RELATED TO HOME.

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
OUT THAT BEING AT THE HIGH

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
SCHOOL THAT MANY HOURS INVOLVED

362
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
IN A TECHNOLOGY CLUB IS THEIR

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
SAFETY ZONE.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THEY CAN BE AWAY FROM HOME WHERE

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THE PROBLEMS ARE, THEY NOT ON

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
THE STREETS.

367
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THEY ARE IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
WITH WONDERFUL ADMINISTRATOR AND

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
SUPPORT GROUPS AND SECURITY AT

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THEIR SIDE, RUNNING AROUND DOING

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ALL KINDS OF FUN ACTIVISTS SO IT

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
WOULD BE A PLACE WHERE ADAM

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
WOULD HAVE FOUND A RELEASE FROM

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ANYTHING THAT WAS DISTURBING

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
HIM.
>>Neil: REMAIN OTHER STUDENTS

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
SCARED OF HIM?

377
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>>Guest: NO ONE WAS SCARED OF

378
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
HIM.
HE WAS THE TYPE THAT WE HAD TO

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
WORRY ABOUT BEING VICTIMIZED.

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
THE TECH CLUB ENVIRONMENT WHICH

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
HE WAS OFTEN INVOLVED IN, WHERE

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WE SPENT OUR TIME TOGETHER, WAS

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
AN ENVIRONMENT COMPRISED OF VERY

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
INTELLECTUAL-MINED KIDS HIGH ON

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
THE BELL CURVE, LOVING, WELL

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
RAISED, WELL RESPECTED, A LOST

387
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
RESPECT FOR ADULTS AND PEERS THE

388
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
GEEKY TYPE.

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I AM SMILING BECAUSE I THINK

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THAT IS A WONDERFUL THING.

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THEY ADOPTED HIM NAUGHTON LIKE

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
YOU WOULD ADOPT ANY NEW FRESHMAN

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
COMING IN BUT WE UNDERSTOOD HE

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
NEEDED A LITTLE BIT EXTRA

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OBSERVATION.

396
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>>Neil: WHAT YOU KNEW OF THE

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
MOM, DOES SHE EVERY LAY TO YOU

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
CONCERN OR A CHILD THAT DOES NOT

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
SEEM TO BE CONNECTING BEING

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL?

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
>>Guest: I CAN MAKE IT CLEAR

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THAT IF MY POSITION AS A

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
DIRECTOR OF SECURITY, THE TYPE

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
OF PERSON IN THIS CASE THAT

405
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
DECIDED TO BE ON THE GROUND EACH

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
DAY RATHER THAN SITTING IN AN

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
OFFICE, AS WELL AS A PERSON WHO

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WOULD BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ON HER SON IN ACTIVITY

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
ON-AND-OFF CAMPUS AND ON THE

411
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
FOOTBALL FIELDS, MRS. LANZA AND

412
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I DID DISCUSS ADAM'S CONDITIONS

413
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AND SPECIAL NEEDS.

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I, TOO, REACHED OUT AND FOUND

415
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OUT MORE AND WE HAD MEETINGS

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
USED EARLY WHEN ADAM CAME TO

417
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SCHOOL WITH PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

418
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AIDES AND GUIDANCE COUNSELORS.

419
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
HE WAS AFFORDED TALENTED AND

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
GOOD SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT TO

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
SOME TOGETHER HE WOULD BE MORE

422
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
SUCCESSFUL EACH DAY HE WAS THIS.

423
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
>>Neil: THANK YOU, RICHARD, WE

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
APPRECIATE THAT.

425
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THIS WERE WARNING SIGNS, DID

426
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
LEGAL LIMITS PREVENT SCHOOL

427
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
AUTHORITIES FROM PURSUING THEM?

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
IT'S KIND OF LIKE DRINKING
A FOOD THAT'S A DRINK,

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
OR A DRINK THAT'S A FOOD,
WOOOOOH!

430
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
[ Male Announcer ] TASTE IT
AND DESCRIBE THE INDESCRIBABLE.

431
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
COULD'VE HAD A V8.

432
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
>> IT WAS EVER ACCIDENT TO ME

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
THERE WAS RELUCTANCE TO TELL

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
PARENTS AND LOVED ONES THAT THE

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
PERSON THEY WERE WAITING FOR WAS

436
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
NOT GOING TO RETURN.

437
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
THAT HAD GONE ON FOR A PERIOD OF

438
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TIME WELL AFTER THERE WAS ANY

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
EXPECTANCY THAT FAMILIES WOULD

440
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
BE REUNITED.

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
>>Neil: REMARKS FROM GOVERNOR

442
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
MALLOY OF CONNECTICUT WHAT HAD
TO BE UNBEARABLE GRIEF FOR

443
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
PARENT WHOSE ARRIVED AT THE

444
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
SCHOOL ON FRIDAY ONLY TO FIND

445
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
OUT THEIR CHILD WAS NOT AMONG

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
THOSE COMING OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

447
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
HOW MUCH COULD WE HAVE KNOWN?

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
HOW MUCH COULD WE HAVE DONE?

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
HOW MUCH COULD BE TELEGRAPHED TO

450
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
AVOID THIS?

451
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
WE HAVE A PSYCHO THERAPIST AND

452
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
ATTORNEY AND SECURITY EXPERT.

453
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
AS A SECURITY GUY WHAT DO YOU DO

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
WHEN YOU KNOW THERE IS CONCERN

455
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
ABOUT A PARTICULAR YOUNG MAN WHO

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
SEEMED EVEN IN THE LAST SEGMENT

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
AS A YOUNG STUDENT, TO HAVE

458
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
RELAYED ODD BEHAVIOR, BUT

459
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
NOTHING MORE, JUST ODD BEHAVIOR.

460
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
>>Guest: I HATE TO SAY THIS

461
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
BUT WE HAVE BAD PEOPLE IN THIS

462
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WORLD AND EVIL PEOPLE IN THIS

463
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WORLD WHO WILL DO BAD THINGS AT

464
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
TIMES NO MATTER WHAT THE WARNING

465
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
SIGNS ARE AND IN THIS CASE THERE

466
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
WASN'T MUCH OH THAN HE DID NOT

467
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
FIT IN, IN THE CLASS ROOM, HE

468
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
SEEMED A LITTLE BIT ODD.

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
BUT THERE IS NOTHING THERE THAT

470
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD HAVE DONE

471
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
OR WOULD HAVE PROBABLY FORESEEN

472
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT SO FAR.

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
>>Neil: WE COULD GO THE OTHER

474
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WAY IN AN ENVIRONMENT AND YOU

475
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
COULD LOOK AT IT AND SAY, WELL,

476
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
WE DON'T WANT TO GO ON A WITCH

477
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
HUNT, DO WE?

478
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
>>Guest: YOU CANNOT GO ON A

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
WITCH HUNT FOR ODD KIDS.

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
EVEN IN ORDER TO GET HIM IN

481
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
VOLUNTARY OUTPAINT TREATMENT

482
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
WHICH HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, YOU

483
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
WOULD HAVE TO GO TO COURT AND

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
GET A COURT ORDER AND GET A

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
JUDGE DO SAY, YES, YOU WILL NOW

486
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
FORCE THIS PERSON TO TAKE

487
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
MEDICATION AND TO SEE A

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THERAPIST BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
CASE, WHO WOULD HAVE DONE THAT?

490
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IT ISN'T THAT HE THREATENED

491
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
ANYONE IN ADVANCE OR THAT HE WAS

492
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AN ACTIVE STUDENT IN A SCHOOL

493
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
WHERE HIS TEACHER COULD HAVE

494
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
SAID, OKAY, THIS CHILD IS VERY

495
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
STUBBED AND HE IS MAKING THREATS

496
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
AND WE ARE AFRAID OF HIM.

497
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
>>Neil: HE DID NOT MAKE ANY

498
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THREATS HE WAS MORE A POTENTIAL

499
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SUBJECT OF BULLYING, SO, DOCTOR,

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WHAT ARE WE OBLIGATED TO DO?

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SYSTEM THERE

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
DID AS MUCH AS IT COULD BE

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
REQUIRED TO DO FROM PSYCHOLOGIST

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
TO BRINGING THIS INTROVERTED

505
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
NATURE TO THE MOM'S ATTENTION.

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
>>Guest: IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN

507
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
HE WAS IN SCHOOL SOMETHING ABOUT

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THE SCHOOL STRUCTURE WAS HEALING

509
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
AND KEEPING HIM TOGETHER AND NOW

510
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
HE IS A KID WHO IS IN HIS 20'S

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
LIVING IF HIS MOTHER'S HOME AND

512
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
HE IS NOT WORKING SO THERE IS A

513
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DISABILITY THERE, YOU HAVE AN

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
INTELLECT CHILD WHO IS ISOLATED.

515
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO LIFT

516
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH

517
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
ISSUES AND ENCOURAGE FAMILIES

518
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR

519
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY ARE ADULTS

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AND DIRECT THEM TO THE

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
APPROPRIATE PLACES TO GET HELP.

522
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
WE CANNOT ALWAYS PREDICT VIOLENT

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
BEHAVIOR.
WE DO LIVE IN AN UNPREDICTABLE

524
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WORLD.

525
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
IF WE DO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO

526
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
NOT HANDLE THINGS ALONE AND TO

527
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
REACH OUT TO PEOPLE IN THE

528
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
COMMUNITY WHO CAN HELP, PERHAPS

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THINGS LIKE THIS WOULD BE LESS

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

531
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
>>Neil: YOU THINK ABOUT IT HE

532
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
WAS OUT SCHOOL A WHILE AT 20

533
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
YEARS OLD AND NEVERTHELESS, A

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
LOT OF PEOPLED THINK THEY SHOULD

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
HAVE NOTICED MORE THE HOW DO YOU

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
HANDLE IT IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND

537
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
YOU KNOW THEIR FRIENDS AND YOU

538
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ARE NOT SURE ABOUT IT, WHERE DO

539
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YOU DRAW THE LINE?

540
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
>>Guest: YOU DRAW THE BEHIND

541
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
AT WHAT IS LEGAL.

542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
YOU HAVE TO ACT IN THE LAW, FROM

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT.

544
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
CAN YOU NOT EXCEED THAT.

545
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>>Neil: WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY

546
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
IF YOU HAVE NO PRIOR HISTORY OF

547
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
VIOLENCE OR BAD BEHAVIOR, ACTING

548
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
VIOLENTLY DOES NOT CUT IT.

549
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
>>Guest: THIS IS A NATIONAL

550
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
DISCUSSION AND WE HAVE TO LOOK

551
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TO THAT, OF HOW WE WILL TELL

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FALLING

553
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IN OUR SOCIETY.

554
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

555
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WHAT CAN LAW ENFORCEMENT DO?

556
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
WHAT AND CAN PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

557
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
LAWYERS DO DO MAKE THE

558
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
DISCUSSION COME TO FRUITION TO

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
MONITOR THE PEOPLE WITH WE HAVE

560
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000

YEAR COME FORWARD AND CAUSE

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
VIOLENT ACTS AS WELL AS TRAGEDY.

563
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>>Neil: WHAT IF THEY GET

564
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL JUST FINE,

565
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
OR COLLEGE, AND HE DROPPED OUT

566
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
AND THEY ARE OUT IN SOCIETY AND

567
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THEN WHAT?
>>Guest: SOMEONE PRESENTS

568
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THEMSELVES AS A DANGER.

569
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
>>Neil: BUT NOTHING

570
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
TELEGRAPHED THAT.

571
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
>>Guest: NO, READING BETWEEN

572
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THE LINES CAN YOU NOT GO TO THE

573
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
JUDGE AND SAID, THIS GUY IS

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
WEIRD WE WANT HIM TO TAKE

575
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
MEDICATION.

576
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> YOU ARE READING BETWEEN THE

577
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
LINES.

578
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERSON

579
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THAT WILL DO THAT.

580
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
IN THIS CASE, FROM WHAT WE KNOW,

581
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
HE STAYED IN HIS HOUSE AND HIS

582
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
MOTHER IS THE ONE THAT IS

583
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
TEACHING HIM HOW TO USE THE GUNS

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SHE IS NOT GOING TO SAY, OKAY,

585
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
MY SON IS STUBBED, LET'S GIVE

586
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
HIM MEDICATION.

587
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
>> SHE SHOULD BE.

588
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SHE SHOULD IS SAID, MY SON, I AM

589
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
STRUGGLING HERE AND I DIDN'T

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
HEAR THAT.

591
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
ALSO, IT IS THE ONLY TIME HER

592
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
SON WAS FEELING GOOD IN SOCIETY

593
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
AND STRONG AND VIRILE IS WHEN

594
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
SHE IS TEACHING HIM WHO TO USE

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
GUNS SHE IS TRAINING HIM TO BE A

596
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
KILLER AND WE MAY NOT WANT TO

597
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
SAY THAT.

598
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
>>Guest: WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

599
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
WAS HAPPENING PRIVATELY IN THE

600
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
HOUSE.

601
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THE FORENSICS OF OF THE HARD

602
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
DRIVE MAY TELL US MORE.

603
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WE KNOW SHE WAS, THE TALK IS SHE

604
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WAS LOOKING FOR A SCHOOL OR A

605
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
PLACE TO SEND HIM.

606
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
WHY IF BECAUSE HE WAS STARTING

607
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
TO ACT OUT AT HOME?

608
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
MAYBE IT WAS HER RESPONSIBILITY

609
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
THEN TO BRING IT FORWARD TO LAW

610
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
ENFORCEMENT OR PSYCHIATRIST OR A

611
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
LAWYER TO THEN TAKE THE

612
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
APPROPRIATE ACTS TO GET HIM

613
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
COMMITTED AND GET HIM THERAPY.

614
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
>>Neil: AND TEACHING SOMEONE

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
DOES NOT MAKE YOU A KILLER.

616
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>>Guest: BUT IT IS DISTURBED.

617
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
>>Neil: IT RAISES AN ISSUE

618
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
FROM WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE

619
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
MOTHER SHE WAS REPEATEDLY AT THE

620
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SCHOOL DEALING WITH COUNSELORS

621
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
KNOWING THERE WERE ISSUES WITH

622
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
HER SON BUT THAT IS NOTHING

623
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
PARENTS WANT TO HEAR L IS SOME

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
CRAZY KID WATCHING THIS

625
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
COVERAGE, WATCHING THIS NATIONAL

626
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
OBSESSION WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN

627
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
THIS DOWN, AND PLOTTING PROBABLY

628
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR.

629
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
>>Guest: IF YOU ARE PLOTTING

630
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU COULD

631
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
NOT FORCE THEM TO GO TO THERAPY

632
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AND YOU CAN HAND THEM A BATTLE

633
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
OF PILLS BUT YOU CANNOT FORCE

634
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
THE PILLS DOWN THEIR LET.

635
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
IF SOMEONE IS SICK ENOUGH THEY

636
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
ARE GOING TO GIVE THEIR OWN HIVE

637
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
IN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING

638
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
HORRIFIC LIKE WHAT HAPPENED

639
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HERE, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
DO.
>>Neil: SO ALL THE GUN LAWS

641
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
AND ALL THE SECURITY MEASURES

642
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THE SCHOOLS ARE TAKEN, IF

643
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
SOMEONE IS INTENT ON DOING

644
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
SOMETHING, REALLY DASTARDLY.

645
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
>>Guest: IF SOMEONE VIOLATE AS

646
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
COURT ORDER IF THEY ARE INTENT

647
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ON DOING THIS.

648
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
>>Guest: IT COULD HAPPEN, BUT,

649
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
IF THAT IS HAPPENING AND IF

650
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
SOMEONE IS OUT THERE AND SOMEONE

651
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
KNOWS ABOUT IT, THEY SHOULD CALL

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE LAW

653
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
ENFORCEMENT AND LAWYERS AND

654
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
PSYCHIATRISTS CAN DO SOMETHING

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND

656
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
POTENTIALLY STOP A DENVER OR

657
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
CONNECTICUT FROM HAPPENING.

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
>>Guest: AND WE CAN MAKE IT

659
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG MEN TO FEEL

660
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES WITHOUT

661
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
NEEDING TO GO ON A SPREE-KILLING

662
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
RAGE.
WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR SOCIETY.

663
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

664
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
THAT.

665
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
>>Neil: THE VICTIMS' PARENTS,

666
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THEY ARE ENRAGED AND LOOKING FOR

667
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
SOMEONE TO BLAME.

668
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WHO?
>>Guest: THAT IS TOUGH.

669
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
>> NO ONE TO BLAME.

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
SOMETIMES AS WE TALK ABOUT, YOU

671
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
GO TO NORWAY, YOU GO TO THE GUY

672
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
WHO WENT OVER THE ISLAND AND

673
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
SHOT UP THE ISLAND KILLING ALL

674
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE, SOMETIMES

675
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
THERE IS IN EXPLANATION.

676
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
SOMETIMES OVERVILLE HAPPENS AND

677
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
TRAGEDIES DO HAPPEN WITHOUT --

678
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
WE WANT AN ANSWER BUT SOMETIMES

679
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THERE IS NO ANSWER.

680
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS

681
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
CAUSING THIS TREND.

682
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T KNOW.

683
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
WE NEED TO FIND OUT.

684
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
>>Neil: THANK YOU.

685
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
IN THE MEANTIME, A FISCAL CLIFF

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
DEAL?

687
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
NOT QUITE, BUT INTERESTING, A

688
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
DAY AFTER TALKING IN NEWTOWN

689
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
ABOUT A COUNTRY COMING TOGETHER,

690
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THE PRESIDENT AND SPEAKER

691
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
BOEHNER ON A DEAL SOME THOUGHT

692
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WAS FALLING APART.

693
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
MAYBE NOT.

694
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
>> HOURS AFTER GETTING

695
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
BIPARTISAN HELP CONNECTICUT,

696
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
BIPARTISANSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

697
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
AND SPEAKER BOEHNER MEETING IN

698
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
PERSON TODAY AT WHITE HOUSE EACH

699
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WITH INTERESTING COMPROMISES ON

700
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THE TABLE INCLUDING THE

701
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
SPEAKER'S REPORTED WILLINGNESS

702
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TO LET TAX RATES RISE FOR THOSE

703
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
MAKING $1 MILLION OR MORE AND

704
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TYING A DEAL TO A POSSIBLE HIKE

705
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
IN THE DEBT CEILING.

706
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
IN RETURN THE PRESIDENT SHOWING

707
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
MORE FLEXIBILITY ON ENTITLEMENT

708
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
SPENDING.
HOW MUCH IS STILL VERY UNCLEAR.

709
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AND NOW, WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THE

710
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
DEVELOPMENTS AND WHETHER WHAT

711
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT IS WHAT

712
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
IS SPURRING THEM ON?

713
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>>Guest: I THINK THAT IS A

714
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
GOOD POINT.

715
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
YES, I DO THINK THEY ARE GETTING

716
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
CLOSER TO A BIPARTISAN

717
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COMPROMISE IN LIGHT OF THE

718
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
TRAGEDY.
THE WHITE HOUSE AND SPEAKER

719
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
BOEHNER'S OFFICE ARE FOUGHT

720
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
GIVING DETAILS ABOUT THE MEETING

721
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THE SPEAKER BOEHNER AND THE

722
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
PRESIDENT HAD.

723
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I HAVE THE SENSE THAT DEMOCRATS

724
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ARE MORE OPTIMISTIC IN THE

725
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
OUTCOME.

726
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER'S OFFICE IS

727
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
SAYING THAT T DON'T

728
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS AS

729
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
SERIOUS AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO

730
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SEE HIM ON SPENDING CUTS.

731
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THE WHITE HOUSE TELLS ME THE

732
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE OPEN

733
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AND THEY ARE STILL NEGOTIATING

734
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
BUT THE DEMOCRATS THING A DEAL

735
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
IS CLOSER NOW THAN REPUBLICANS

736
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
DO.
>>Neil: OBVIOUSLY THEY AWARE

737
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT YOU DO

738
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THOUGHT WANT TO LOOK LIKE YOU

739
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
ARE POINTING FINGERS AND COME

740
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
MAINING.

741
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
THAT MAKES IT INCUMBENT UPON THE

742
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS TO

743
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE TRYING, WHICH

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
COULD EXPLAIN WHY, TODAY, THEY

745
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WOULD BE DEALING?

746
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>>Guest: THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

747
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER

748
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
AND THEY WANT DID GET A DEAL

749
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
DONE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR

750
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
A LOT OF CRITICISM FROM THEIR

751
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
BASE.
WE HAVE SEEN THE CLUB FOR GROWTH

752
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
AND TEA PARTY GROUPS ARE

753
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
CRITICIZING SPEAKER BOEHNER FOR

754
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THIS IDEA HE IS WILLING TO GIVE

755
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
ON TAX RATES BUT THEY DON'T WANT

756
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
TO HEAR THE COMPLAINTS.

757
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
AS WE GO TO THE NEXT WEEK, WE

758
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
WILL HEAR MORE FROM 9D BASE

759
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE

760
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THE PRESIDENT GIVE UP MORE ON

761
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SPENDING CUTS OR ENTITLEMENT

762
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
REFORM SO A LOT OF THIS IS GOING

763
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND WE

764
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
ARE NOT GIVING THEM THE DETAILS.

765
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
>>Neil: WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT

766
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
ON AT THE MEETING IN OBVIOUSLY

767
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
IT IS HOURS AFTER THE PRESIDENT

768
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
SPOKE LAST NIGHT IN CONNECTICUT.

769
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED.

770
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>>Guest: RIGHT NEW THEY

771
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
FIDDLING WITH THE AMOUNT OF

772
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
REVENUE THEY CAN RAISE IF THIS

773
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
DEAL.
WE SAW SPEAKER BOEHNER PUT FORTH

774
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
$800 IF RAISING REVENUE.

775
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
DOUSE THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT

776
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WASN'T ENOUGH WITH THE FIRST

777
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
PROPOSAL AT $1.6 TRILLION AND

778
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THE PRESIDENT CAME DOWN TO $1.4

779
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
TRILLION LAST WEEK AND NOW THEY

780
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A

781
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
COMPROMISE ON THE AMOUNT OF

782
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
REVENUE THEY CAN RAISE.

783
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

784
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SETTLE ON BEFORE THEY TALK

785
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
SPENDING CUTS.

786
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
>>Neil: HOW IRONIC THAT WOULD

787
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
BE, IT TAKE AS TRAGEDY TO GET US

788
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
OFF THE CLIFF.

789
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WE WILL SEE.

790
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
THANK YOU.

791
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
DO YOU ASK, HOW COULD GOD LESS

792
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
THIS HAPPEN?

793
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD

794
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY ASK

795
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THAT QUESTION AGAIN AND AGAIN

796
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
SINCE THIS HORROR?

797
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THAT IS NEXT.

798
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000

819
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> MY LITTLE GIRL WAS SO FULL OF
LIFE AND WANTED A HORSE SO BADLY

820
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
AND WAS GOING TO GET BOOT GOES

821
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
CHRISTMAS AND SHE IS NOT COMING

822
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
HOME.

823
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I WANT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT HER

824
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AND...ALL THE THING SHE LOVED TO

825
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
DO.

826
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
>> I FOUND A JOURNAL AND I

827
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
OPENED THE BOOK AND IT WAS WHAT

828
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I NEEDED BECAUSE IT SAID I LOVE

829
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
YOU SO MUCH.

830
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
IT IS LIKE SHE KNEW WE WERE

831
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO HELP

832
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
US GET THROUGH THIS.

833
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
>>Neil: WE CANNOT IMAGINE HOW

834
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

835
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
TO SO MANY INNOCENT LITTLE

836
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
CHILDREN.
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ASKING, HOW

837
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
COULD GOD LET IT HAPPEN?

838
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
HOW COULD HE LET THE BEAUTIFUL

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
CHILDREN DIE?
IT IS A NATURAL QUESTION.

840
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
THE SENIOR PASTOR OF THE

841
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
POTTER'S HOUSE WILL TRY TO GIVE

842
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
US ANSWERS.

843
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BISHOP?

844
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
>>Guest: FIRST, WHAT IS DEEPER

845
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THAN THE QUESTION IS A PLACE OF

846
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
PAIN IT COMES FROM, WHERE WE

847
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
KNELL HAVE A TENDENCY TO WANT TO

848
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
FIND A RATIONAL REASON FOR THIS

849
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
EVENT AND SOMETIMES WE NEED TO

850
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
HOLD SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE BUT GOD

851
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
DOES NOT SHOOT GUNS.

852
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
WHAT WE ARE ASKING GOD TO DO IS

853
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
TAKE AWAY HUMAN WILL.

854
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
IN REALITY, THE FREEDOM OF WILL

855
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
CAUSES US TO BE CREATIVE AND

856
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
LETS US CREATE INVENTIONS AND

857
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
CHOOSE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON OUR

858
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
OWN AND THAT MAKES US UNIQUE BUT

859
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE THAT

860
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
FREEDOM OF WILL AND IT GOES

861
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
AWRY, GOD CREATED FREEDOM OF

862
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
WILL AND GAVE US A CONSCIENCE

863
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
AND GAVE US VOICES TO GUIDE US

864
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ON THE PROCESS AND 90 PERCENT OF

865
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THE TIME IT WORKED.

866
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
IN CASES WHERE THEY COULD BE

867
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL DISTURBANCES

868
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
THEY GO ASKEW AND IN THOSE

869
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
CASES, IT CANND UP IN THIS TYPE

870
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
OF TRAGEDY.

871
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>>Neil: YOU KNOW, BISHOP,

872
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
PEOPLE HEARING THAT AND IT IS

873
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
CONSOLING BUT IT WILL BE LITTLE

874
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
RELIEF TO THE PARENTS OF THE

875
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO COULD

876
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SAY YES, WE BELIEVE IN THIS IDEA

877
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
OF FREE WILL AND MAN CREATES HIS

878
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
OWN LOT BUT YOU WOULD THING NEW

879
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
AND THEN GOD WOULD INTERVENE.

880
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
>>Guest: I THINK WHAT WE

881
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO TAKE OUR

882
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THOUGHTS DOWN TO THE PRACTICAL

883
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR REACH AS

884
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
HUMANS, TO BE OUR BROTHER'S

885
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
KEEPER AND WATCH OUT FOR PEOPLE

886
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WHO ARE DISPLAYING EMERGE

887
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
BEHAVIORS, TO BE ABLE TO

888
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IDENTIFY THEM BEFORE THIS SORT

889
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
OF THING BEGINS TO HAPPEN, AND,

890
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THEN, I HAVE TO CONDITION OCCUR

891
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
WITH THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT

892
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
WHAT SO ELOQUENTLY SAID DURING

893
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE FUNERAL THAT FAITH IS A

894
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
GIFT, IT REALLY TRULY IS A GIFT

895
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
AND TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE

896
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
FAITH, OF ANY KIND, THAT IS A

897
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
GIFT AND PARTICULARLY FOR ME AS

898
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
A CHRISTIAN TO RECOGNIZE FAITH

899
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
DOES NOT MEAN THERE IS NO DOUBT,

900
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THAT THERE ARE NO UNRESOLVED

901
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
QUESTIONS, FAITH IS MORE

902
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
EFFECTIVE WHEN THERE ARE NO

903
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
RATIONAL REASONS TO EXPLAIN

904
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
ITSELF, IT LIVES ITSELF TO THE

905
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
REVEALED PRESENCE OF GOD AND TO

906
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO WALK IN

907
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
THAT AND TO BELIEVE IT IS SO

908
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
IMPORTANT OF THE FAITH CAN EXIST

909
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
IN THE PRESENCE OF DOUBT THE WAY

910
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
COURAGE CAN EXIST IN THE

911
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
PRESENCE OF FEAR.

912
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
PEOPLE ARE CONFLICTED.

913
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
IT WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS.

914
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
WE WON'T PROCESS THIS THIS WEEK,

915
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
THE FAMILIES WILLING NOT PROCESS

916
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
FOR YEARS.

917
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I CAUTIOUS LOOKING FOR QUICK

918
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
ANSWERS IT LIFE WHICH IS

919
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
COMPLICATED.

920
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>>Neil: FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT

921
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
RELIGIOUS AND SAY, WHY SHOULD I

922
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
BE RELIGIOUS IN A WORLD WHERE

923
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
EVIL SEEMS TO HAVE WON MORE

924
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000

IN SOMEONE'S EMOTION WHOSE

SMALL TOWN IS LEAVING SILENCE

1125
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THAT EVEN NOW IS DEAFENING.

1134
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
>>Neil: TRADING ON FRIDAY WAS
VERY LIGHT AND IN THIS

1135
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
SUPPOSEDLY CAPITALIST COUNTRY,

1136
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
HEARTS WERE HEAVY AND FOR A

1137
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
BRIEF MOMENT, TODAY, IT WAS

1138
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
SILENT.

1139
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
A MOMENT SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES

1140
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
WHEN NO ONE IS SPEAKING AT ALL.

1141
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
WHEN THEY ARE JUST WATCHING.

1142
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
AND THINKING.

1143
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
AND WONDERING.

1144
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND IN A PLACE LIKE WALL STREET

1145
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
WHERE MONEY MEANS EVERYTHING,

1146
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, IT MEANT

1147
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
NOTHING.
MONEY POWERLESS TO BRING BACK 20

1148
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
LIVES, MONEY USELESS TO MAKE SO

1149
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
MANY DEVASTATED PARENTS WHOLE.

1150
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
MONEY THAT COULD NOT BUY ONE OF

1151
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
THEM A HAPPY CHRISTMAS NOW.

1152
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
OR EVEN BRING IF A BETTER NEW

1153
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
YEAR.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS MONEY

1154
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
CANNOT BUY INCLUDING PEACE OF

1155
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
MIND.

1156
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
THE REALIZATION OF THAT IS THE

1157
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
MORE HUMBLING REALITIES OF ALL

1158
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
OF THIS.

1159
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THAT THE THINGS WE SCRAMBLE FOR

1160
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
IN LIFE AND FIGHT FOR IN LIFE

1161
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
AND SCRATCH AND CLAW EACH OTHER

1162
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
TO GAIN AN EDGE IN LIFE IS SO

1163
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
SILLY WHEN WE ARE DEAD AND GONE.

1164
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
AND WE THING MORE OF THE

1165
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
FRAGILITY OF LIFE AND LESS OF

1166
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
OUR "STUFF" IN LIFE AND WE TAKE

1167
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
A LOOK AT THE LITTLE CHILDREN

1168
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
JUST STARTING LIFE AND WE THINK

1169
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
ABOUT THIS STUFF EVEN LESS.

1170
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
"STUFF" DOESN'T MATTER.
NONE OF THIS IS TO SAY IN THE

1171
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
GREAT CAPITALIST SOCIETY WE

1172
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
DON'T
