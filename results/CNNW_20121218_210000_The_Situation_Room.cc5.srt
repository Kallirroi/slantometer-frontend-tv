1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
>>> A SMALL STEP BACK TO NORMAL

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
TODAY IN THIS CONNECTICUT TOWN

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
THAT IS SCARRED FOREVER.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
MOST NEWTOWN STUDENTS WENT BACK

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
TO SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE MASSACRE WITH POLICE

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
STANDING GUARD.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
TWO MORE YOUNG VICTIMS ARE

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
BURIED, AND THE MAN INVOLVED IN

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THE INVESTIGATION TELLS ME ABOUT

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THE HORRORS HE SAW INSIDE THE

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
>> THE CRIME SCENE ITSELF IS

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE A MARK

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
IN ALL OF OUR MINDS.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THE TASK OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
WITH THE CRIME SCENE IS

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL NEVER BE

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ABLE TO ERASE.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
>> THERE WILL NEVER BE A GOOD

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ENOUGH EXPLANATION WHY 20

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WERE GUNNED

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
DOWN BUT WE ALL NEED ANSWERS.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'M WOLF BLITZER REPORTING FROM

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
STATE POLICE IS WORKING AROUND

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THE CLOCK.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
SCHOOL MASSACRE IS VERY

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
METHODICAL AND VERY, VERY

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PAINFUL.
JOINING US NOW, LIEUTENANT PAUL

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
VANCE.
HE'S BECOME THE FACE, THE

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SPOKESMAN OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE, WE'RE HERE IN

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
YOUR OFFICE IN MIDDLETOWN,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
CONNECTICUT.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD ON THE

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
JOURNALISTS SO IT MUST BE SO

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
MUCH MORE HARD ON THE MEN AND

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
WOMEN THAT WORK AT THE

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> IT'S BEEN A HORRIBLE, TRAGIC

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SCENE.
THE INITIAL RESPONSE WAS JUST

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HORRIFIC.
THE MEN AND WOMAN THAT RISKED

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THEIR LIVES GOING IN THERE
TRYING TO STOP THE AGGRESSION,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
TRYING TO STOP THE SHOOTING AND

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
CARNAGE AND RESCUE AS MANY

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
PEOPLE AS THEY COULD TRULY PUT

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE BUT EVEN

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MORE SO, THE FACULTY, THE STAFF,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE TEACHERS THAT TRIED AND DID
PROTECT MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THERE'S GOOD AND BAD BUT OUR

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HEARTS ARE JUST SIMPLY BROKEN

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
JUST DUE TO THE FACT THAT 26

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
PEOPLE DIED IN THAT BUILDING.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> HOW ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE,

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS, HOW ARE
THEY DOING?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
>> THEY ARE WORKING THROUGH
THIS.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WE PROVIDE COUNSELING AND

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE TO THEM.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS ALSO BUT

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THESE

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
TYPES OF THINGS.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE DAY WILL COME WHERE WE WILL

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SIT DOWN AND TRULY HIT A WALL

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND HAVE TO REALLY TALK IT OUT.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BUT IT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRAINED

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
TO DO AND THE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
RISEN TO THE OCCASION AND THEY

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ARE WORKING 24 HOURS A DAY AND

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
WILL CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL WE

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
RECTIFY AND ANSWER ALL OF THE

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT HAPPENED.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION,
WHAT HAPPENED?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WHY?
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN IN THE

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
MIDDLE OF CONNECTICUT IN A

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE TOWN?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I GUESS THE KEY QUESTION IS,

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
WHY?
DO WE HAVE AN ANSWER?

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER YET.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WE'VE GOT A NUMBER -- A NUMBER

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OF MAJOR CRIME DETECTIVES, OUR

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
FORENSIC PEOPLE, WE HAVE ALL OUR

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
EXPERTS, ALL OF OUR EXPERTISE,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WE HAVE OUR TOOLBOX WIDE OPEN

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
AND WE'VE GOT EVERYONE INVOLVED.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AND IT'S NOT JUST US.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WE'RE BEING ASSISTED BY THE
NEWTOWN POLICE, FEDERAL POLICE

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
IS HELPING US.
WE'VE GOT TO ANSWER THOSE

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
QUESTIONS.
WE'VE GOT TO DETERMINE HOW AND

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WHY THIS HAPPENED.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WE'VE GOT TO PUT THIS PUZZLE

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TOGETHER AND PAINT A CRYSTAL

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
CLEAR PICTURE TO TRY TO ANSWER
YOU WILL OF THE QUESTIONS

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SURROUNDING THIS CASE.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> IN YOUR MIND -- AND YOU KNOW
A LOT MORE THAN THE REST OF US,

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
IN YOUR MIND, DO YOU HAVE A

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHY THIS

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SHOOTER WENT INTO THE SCHOOL AND

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
KILLED THOSE KIDS AND TEEMPERS?
>> NOT AT ALL.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WE'RE WAY TOO EARLY AND I KNOW

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THAT SOUNDS ALMOST FOUR DAYS

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
AFTER THE FACT BUT WE'RE WAY TOO

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
EARLY.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SO MUCH EVIDENCE TO EXAMINE, SO

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
MUCH ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS TO

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
CONDUCT.
IT'S GOING TO BE TIME CONSUMING

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO ALL THAT

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WORK.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED.
>> WHEN YOU SAY NO INTERVIEWS, I

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ASSUME YOU'RE TALKING TO HIS

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
FAMILY MEMBERS?
ARE THEY COOPERATING?

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND THEY HAVE THEIR IDEAS?

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> SURE.
>> DO WE KNOW IF HE WAS UNDER

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
MEDICATION, IF HE HAD A MENTAL

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
ILLNESS, DO WE KNOW ISSUES LIKE

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I DO KNOW THE BEST WAY I CAN

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
EXPLAIN IT IS, WE HAVE TEAMS AND
DETECTIVES THAT WILL LOOK AT

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THAT FACET.
WE'LL HAVE TEAMS AND DETECTIVES

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THAT WILL LOOK AT THE WEAPONS,

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THE WEAPONRY AND TRACE THEM FROM

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THE MINUTE THEY CAME OFF THE
ASSEMBLY LINE UNTIL THE TIME WE

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
SEIZED THEM, WHO'S HANDS THEY

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WERE IN.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ALL THE ANSWERS, THE AMMUNITION,

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED, BY WHOM,

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ALL OF THAT STUFF.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND WE TRULY HAVE BOOTS ON THE

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
GROUND, GOOD OLD SHOE LEATHER

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
POLICE WORK.
MEN AND WOMEN ARE GOING TO GO

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OUT THERE AND GET THESE ANSWERS.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
>> IS THERE A, AS BEST AS YOU

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
KNOW, A SUICIDE NOTE?

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I DO KNOW THAT WE'VE EXECUTED

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SEARCH WARRANTS AT THE SECONDARY

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
CRIME SCENE WHICH WAS A PRIVATE

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
RESIDENCE.
WE DID EXTRACT A GREAT DEAL OF

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
EVIDENCE.
THAT I DO KNOW.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> FROM THE HOME?

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
>> YES.

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
>> WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED?

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
>> WITH HIS MOTHER?

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
BUT I DON'T HAVE A DETAILED

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
NOTICE OF WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S EXTREMELY
HELPFUL.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
>> BECAUSE THE REPORTS ARE THAT
HIS COMPUTER HAD BEEN DAMAGED,

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THE HARD DRIVE HAD BEEN DAMAGED

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO COME UP

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WITH SOME SOEF WAITED WAY TO

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
COME UP WITH INFORMATION ON THAT

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HARD DRIVE?

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE WAY WE DO THESE TYPES OF

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
CASES IS, I AM THE ONLY
SPOKESMAN RELATIVE TO THIS

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
INVESTIGATION.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS PERSONAL

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE CAN AND CAN

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CAN'T SAY.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SEIZED IN THAT HOUSE.
THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
PROVIDED ME WITH THAT

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE DON'T
DETAIL THE EVIDENCE.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY, IF THERE

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WAS A COMPUTER THERE, ANY
ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE THERE, IT

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
WAS SEIZED.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WE HAVE A FORENSIC LABORATORY

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THAT CAN ANALYZE THAT EVIDENCE.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE THAT IS
WAS SEIZED AT THAT SCENE CAN GO

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
TO OUR SCIENTIFIC LAB.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
CERTAINLY WE'LL EXAMINE IT ALL

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL HELP US TO

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A CONCLUSION.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> IN YOUR MIND, DO YOU HAVE ANY

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IDEA WHY HE KILLED HIS MOTHER?

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> I DON'T.

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
>> IS HIS FATHER HELPING YOU?

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> I'M SURE WE'LL TALK TO FAMILY

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
MEMBERS AS THIS CASE EVOLVES.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE'S CERTAIN STEPS AND

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CASE, CERTAINLY THE FIRST WAS

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
RIGHT IN NEWTOWN ITSELF, GETTING

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
AS MANY ANSWERS AS WE CAN FOR

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THE FAMILIES OF THESE DECEASED

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
VICTIMS.
ONE THING THAT WE DID DO IS WE

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
PROVIDED A TROOPER WITH EACH

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
FAMILY.
THAT HE WAS LIKE AN UMBILICAL

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
CORD TO AFFORD THESE VICTIMS'

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
FAMILIES DIRECT CONTACT TO THIS

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
INVESTIGATION SO THAT ANY

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
QUESTIONS OR ANY ISSUES THAT

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THEY MIGHT HAVE, WE WOULD

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
INSTANTANEOUSLY GIVE THEM

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
ANSWERS AND HELP.

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
WE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SEE, FOR

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
EXAMPLE, SOMETHING ON THE NEWS

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ABOUT THIS CASE WITHOUT THEM
KNOWING FIRSTHAND.

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THAT.
>> 26 TROOPERS DEALING WITH 26

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
FAMILIES?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SIR.

209
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> SO THERE'S A TROOPER ASSIGNED

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
TO EACH FAMILY.

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
HIS OLDER BROTHER, I ASSUME

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM, HE'S

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
COOPERATING?

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
>> WE'VE REACHED OUT OVERSTATE

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
LINES AND HAD ASSISTANCE FROM

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
OUTSIDE --
>> BECAUSE HE WAS LIVING IN

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY?

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
>> YES AND CERTAINLY THEY ARE

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
ASSISTING US WHEREVER WE

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
REQUIRE.
>> IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING AS
TOUGH AS THIS IN YOUR CAREER?

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE?

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> I JUST STARTED MY 39th YEAR

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
AND THIS IS THE MOST HORRIFIC

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
INCIDENT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
IN.
>> I WAS OVER AT THE FIREHOUSE

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
YESTERDAY.

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I WALKED AROUND.
YOU HAD JUST LEFT.

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I WAS HOPING TO MEET YOU THERE
BUT YOU HAD JUST LEFT.

231
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

232
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THAT

233
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
FIREHOUSE, AS THE FAMILIES WERE

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
GETTING THERE DOWN THE STREET

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FROM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WORD WAS BEGINNING TO REACH

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
EVERYONE THAT THERE WERE DEAD

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
KIDS.

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> YEP.
>> INSIDE, WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> PEOPLE RESPONDED ABOUT THE

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SCENE AND ABOUT THE SITUATION.

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THEY RESPONDED TO COME AND

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
RETRIEVE THEIR CHILDREN AND WHEN

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THEY COULDN'T FIND THEIR

245
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
CHILDREN, FEAR SET IN, PANIC SET

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
IN, PAIN SET IN.

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
IT WAS FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN AND

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WHEN THE NOTIFICATION WAS

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
FINALLY MADE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

250
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
HEARTBREAKING.
>> YOU WERE THERE AT THE TIME?

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> YES.
>> AND THE GOVERNOR NOTIFIED THE

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
FAMILIES THAT THEIR LITTLE

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
6-YEAR-OLD OR LITTLE 7-YEAR-OLD

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WAS DEAD?

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE THERE?

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> IT'S SOMETHING NO ONE WANTS

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
TO EXPERIENCE.

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
IT WAS JUST HEARTBREAKING.

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
TERRIBLE.
>> A LOT MORE KIDS AND TEACHERS

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
>> NO QUESTION.

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> THERE WAS STILL AMMUNITION HE

264
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HAD AVAILABLE, IS THAT RIGHT?

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
>> THERE WAS IMMENSE AMOUNT OF
AMMUNITION AVAILABLE, YES.

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> POTENTIALLY HE COULD HAVE

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
KILLED --
>> HUNDREDS.

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> REALLY?
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN -- I GUESS
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THINGS -- YOU WANT TO TALK TO

271
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
EYEWITNESSES BUT A LOT OF THE

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
EYEWITNESSES WERE KIDS.

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> AND HOW DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
ASK A 6, 7, 9-YEAR-OLD WHAT

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
HAPPENED TO BOBBY, CAROL?
>> YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE BIG

276
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
PICTURE.
OUR INVESTIGATORS WILL MAKE A

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
DETERMINATION AS TO WHO NEEDS TO

278
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BE INTERVIEWED.

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SRNLY THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE THAT

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WERE WOUNDED THAT SURVIVED.
>> BOTH EDUCATORS?

281
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> BOTH EDUCATORS.

282
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> HOW ARE THEY DOING?

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
>> WE ARE TOLD THAT THEY WILL

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
SURVIVE AND THEY WILL BE HUGE IN

285
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HELPING US RECONSTRUCT THIS

286
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
EVENT.
AND WE'LL TALK TO THE EDUCATORS

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
IN THE FACILITY.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WE'LL TALK TO ALL OF THE

289
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
APPROPRIATE WITNESSES TO CAST

290
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
INFORMATION ON TO THIS CASE.

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WE MAY OR MAY NOT TALK TO

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
CHILDREN.

293
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED AS TO --

294
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
AGGRAVATE -- THEY'VE GONE
THROUGH HELL TO BEGIN WITH.

296
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
WE CANNOT AND HE WILL NOT DAMAGE

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THESE CHILDREN ANY FURTHER.

299
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THEY HAVE LIVED THROUGH HELL AND

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADD TO THAT.

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IF WE CAN GET AROUND IT, WE

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
WILL.
>> USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A MASS

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SHOOTING LIKE THIS, THERE ARE A

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
LOT MORE INJURED THAN KILLED.
IN THIS CASE, THERE WERE 26

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
KILLED, TWO INJURED.

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ISN'T THAT -- THAT'S PRETTY -- I

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
MEAN, I CAN ONLY ASSUME, HE WAS

308
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
DELIBERATELY, NOT ONLY WANTING
TO HURT, HE WANTED TO KILL.

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> THAT IS WHAT IT APPEARS.

310
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT APPEARS.

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
AND --
>> EACH ONE OF THESE KIDS WAS

312
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES.

313
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
>> THAT'S THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
REPORT, YES.
AND AS I SAID, THE ROUNDS AND

315

HIGH-CAPACITY CLIPS THAT WERE

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WITH HIM, IT COULD HAVE BEEN

317
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
MUCH WORSE.

C-MAX has a nice little trait,

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>>> BIT BY BIT WE'RE LEARNING

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MORE ABOUT THE SANDY HOOK
ELEMENTARY GUNMAN, 20-YEAR-OLD

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
ADAM LANZA.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
ONE OF HIS FORMER CLASSMATES

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SAYS LANZA WAS ONCE, ONCE, A

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
GOOD KID.
QUIET, SHY, NOT THE TYPE YOU

368
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
WOULD EVER EXPECT TO COMMIT A

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
MASSACRE.

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
ALLEN DIAZ SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY TO

371
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> HE HAD THIS TYPICAL NERD

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
LOOK, KHAKI PANTS, SHIRT TUCKED

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
IN, A COMPUTER CASE INSTEAD OF A

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
BACKPACK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
HE EVEN HAD A POCKET PROTECTOR

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THAT HE HAD PENS IN.
WE ALL KIND OF KNEW LIKE THAT HE

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
HAD PROBLEMS SOCIALLY AND WE

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
KIND OF HAD A FILING THAT

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
FEELING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
HAVE BEEN WRONG WITH HIM BUT WE

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
NEVER ASKED.

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
OBVIOUSLY IT DOES BECAUSE, YOU

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
KNOW, HE'S A VERY BIG PART OF

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THIS EVENT.

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
THINK OF IT.

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
>> SADLY, HE'S THE REASON FOR

389
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
IT.
>> YEAH.

390
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THAT INTERVIEW AND A REPORT FROM

392
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI.
THAT'S COMING UP IN OUR NEXT

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HOUR.

THE AUTOPSY REPORTS ON ADAM

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
LANZA AND HIS MOTHER NANCY ARE

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
PROVIDING GRUESOME NEW DETAILS

397
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
ABOUT THEIR DEATH.

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WE'RE JOINED BY DEBORAH

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
FEYERICK.
DEB, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

400
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
>> Reporter:

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, IT REALLY

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
GOES TO THE HEART OF THE

403
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATORS WERE

404
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
HERE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, HOUR AND

405
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
A HALF.

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THEY CONTINUE TO GATHER EVIDENCE

407
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
AND FOLLOW LEADS.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER TODAY TOLD

408
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
US THAT IN FACT NANCY LANZA WAS

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
SHOT IN HER BED AS SHE SLEPT

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
FOUR TIMES IN THE HEAD BY HER

411
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SON.
THE COMPUTER THAT WAS RECOVERED

412
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
BY INVESTIGATORS, IT WAS CAN

413
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
COMPLETELY SMASHED.
THE HARD DRIVE SHATTERED.

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
THEREFORE, INVESTIGATORS ARE

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
HAVING A HARD TIME RETRIEVING

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
INFORMATION FROM THAT COMPUTER.

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AND SO THE INVESTIGATOR, THE

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
ONLY PERSON THAT CAN COULD HAVE

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
POTENTIALLY TESTIFIED WHAT WAS

420
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
GOING ON IN HER SON'S MIND,

421
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
NANCY LANZ ZA WAS SHOT AND

422
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
KILLED.

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU LOST A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE

424
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AND WITNESS AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
BEEN GOING ON.
THE BODIES OF THE ALLEGED GUNMAN

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AND HIS MOM, THEY ARE NOT BEING

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
RELEASED JUST YET.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PICKED UP AND

429
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THE FAMILY SAYS THAT THEY ARE

430
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
NOT GOING TO BE PICKED UP UNTIL

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THEY ARE -- THEY ARE NOT GOING

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THAT UNTIL

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
THE BODIES ARE ACTUALLY BURIED.

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO RUN INTO

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
ANY KIND OF PROBLEM.

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
TAKE A CLOSE LISTEN, WOLF POLICE

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
INVESTIGATORS RETURNED TO THE

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
HOME OF THE GUNMAN TUESDAY.

439
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE HAVING A HARD

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
TIME RETRIEVING DATA FROM A BAD

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
DEE DAMAGED COMPUTER FOUND

442
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
INSIDE THE HOUSE, ACCORDING TO A

443
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE, BECAUSE

444
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
THE HARD DRIVE WAS SHATTERED.

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
NOT ONLY DOES IT APPEAR ADAM

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
LANZA TRIED TO ERASE THE DIGITAL
FOOT STEPS, HE SHOT THE ONLY

447
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WITNESS THAT COULD HAVE FULLY

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING ON

449
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
INSIDE HIM.

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
HIS MOTHER NANCY, SHOT FOUR

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
TIMES IN THE HEAD AS SHE SLEPT

452
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
IN HER HEAD, LIKELY EARLY

453
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
FRIDAY, THE AUTOPSY SHOWS.

454
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
UNDER THE TERMS OF HER 2009

455
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
DIVORCE AGREEMENT, SHE WAS THE

456
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING HER

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
SON'S PSYCHIATRIC OR

458
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPENSES, PLUS

459
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
COSTS OF ANY PRESCRIPTION

460
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
MEDICATIONS NOT COVERED BY

461
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
INSURANCE.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER IS WAITING

462
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
FOR RESULTS OF TOXICOLOGY TESTS

463
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
PERFORMED ON ADAM LANZA TO SEE

464
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
IF HE WAS ON ANY MEDICATIONS OR
DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ADDED TO THE RAMPAGE.

466
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
THEY ARE ALSO WORKING WITH

467
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE IF

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
LANZA WAS CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED

469
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
WITH AS BERGER'S OR WHETHER

470
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
ANYTHING ELSE --
>> NOW, WE ARE TOLD THAT BY A

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
FRIEND WHO WE SPOKE WITH LAST

472
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
NIGHT AND WHO HAD DONE WORK

473
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
INSIDE THE HOME THAT IN FACT

474
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
NANCY LANZA HAD A GUN LOCK BOX

475
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
KEPT IN THE BASEMENT OF HER

476
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
HOME.

477
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
SHE TOLD A FRIEND THAT SHE

478
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
ACTUALLY TOOK ADAM TO THE GUN

479
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
RANGE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO

480
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
LEAVE HIM ALONE AND THEREFORE

481
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
THEY WOULD GO TOGETHER BECAUSE

482
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING, WOLF,

484
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, BACK IN

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
2009, THAT'S REALLY THE LAST

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
TIME WE HAVE ANY HARD RECORD OF

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
ANY CLASSES HE TOOK, ANY COURSES

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
HE WAS ENROLLED IN.

489
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
AFTER THAT, RIGHT AT THE TIME

490
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THAT THE DIVORCE WAS FINALIZED,

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
IT SEEMS AS IF ADAM LANZA FELL

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

493
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
THERE'S NO RECORD OF WHAT HE

494
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
DID, WHO HE MET WITH.

495
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
WE'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

496
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
FINDING FRIENDS WHO KNEW HIM

497
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
FROM THE PERIOD 2009 ON.

498
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
SO HE EXISTED BUT HE EXISTED IN

499
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A WORLD THAT REALLY NOBODY KNOWS

500
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ABOUT, WOLF.
>> DEBORAH FEYERICK, THANKS VERY

501
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
LET'S DIG A LITTLE DEEPER.

503
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
KATE BOLDUAN IS JOINING US HERE

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
IN NEWTOWN AS WE'VE PUT THE
LATEST INFORMATION OF ADAM

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
LANZA'S MENTALITY HEALTH INTO A

506
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
PROPER PERSPECTIVE.

507
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
JOINING US IS DR. DREW.
DR. DREW, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

508
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SAYS HE WAS TOLD THAT ADAM LANZA

509
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

510
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
ASBERGER'S SYNDROME.

511
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH

512
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
VIOLENCE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I

513
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
KNOW THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

514
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST.

516
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
>> I DO DEAL WITH THIS A LOT.

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
IT'S A NEUROBIOLOGICAL, AND NOT

518
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THOUGHT OF AS A MENTAL DISORDER

519
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
PER SE.
ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS IS

520
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
NOT PICKING UP ON SOCIAL CUES,

521
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
SOMETIMES SO SEVERELY THAT THEY

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
HAVE DIFFICULTY EMPHASIZING WITH

523
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
PEOPLE BUT CATEGORICALLY IS NOT

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE UNTIL

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS GOING ON.

526
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT THE

527
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
SECOND HIT WAS HERE THAT CAUSED

528
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
HIM TO RETREAT SO SEVERELY TO

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
THE POINT THAT HE WAS IN THE

530
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
HOME, ISOLATED, AND A YOUNG

531
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
ADULT UNABLE TO BE LEFT ALONE BY

532
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
HIS MOTHER TO THE POINT THAT SHE

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
TAKES HIM TO THE SHOOTING RANGE,

534
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
THAT'S BIZARRE.

535
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
BY THE WAY, MOM IS GOING TO PLAY

536
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A BIG ROLE HERE.
THERE IS NOT A MENTAL HEALTH

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
PROFESSIONAL THAT WOULD SAY TO

538
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
TAKE TO A SHOOTING RANGE TO

539
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
ENHANCE HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

540
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE

541
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
WITH MOM AS WELL.

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.

543
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
>> YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE

544
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

545
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
BUT WHAT MEDICATION NORMALLY

546
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH

547
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME?

548
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
BECAUSE WE HEARD SANJAY GUPTA,

549
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
SENSITIVE MEDICATION, WHEN YOU

550
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
GO OFF OF IT, THAT COULD CAUSE

551
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SOME PROBLEMS.

552
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
>> IT CAUSES TROUBLE BUT NOT

553
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
PREMEDITATED VIOLENCE.

554
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
IT CAN CAUSE AGITATION AND

555
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
EXTREME FLUCTUATIONS OF MOOD BUT

556
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BE SOMETHING

557
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO

558
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
MEDICATION.
ASPERGER'S MEDICATION, NO, NOT

559
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
TYPICALLY.
SOMETIMES THERE'S SOMETHING

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
CALLED CHEMICAL CONTAINMENT TO

561
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
HELP PEOPLE CONTAIN FOCUS, BEING

562
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
ABLE TO MANAGE BETTER.

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
YES, THE SEVERELY AUTISTIC

564
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
SPECTRUM SOMETIMES GETS INTO

565
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THOSE MEDICATIONS AND YOU HAVE

566
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
TO WONDER WHETHER THIS IS

567
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
FURTHER DOWN THE AUTISTIC

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
SYNDROME.

569
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
AND BY THE WAY, THESE WORDS LIKE
ASPERGER'S ARE GOING TO ALMOST

570
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
HAVE NO MEANING GOING FORWARD.

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS

572
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
REALLY TROUBLING ME.

573
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
WE ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY

574
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
PRIVACY ISSUES.
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

575
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THE INABILITY TO ENROLL NATIONAL

576
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
GUN LAWS BECAUSE OF FEAR OF

577
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
SUITS BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM FOR,

578
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
GOD FORBID, ANYBODY ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT SOMEBODY'S

579
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
PREVIOUS HISTORY IF THEY WANT TO

580
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
HAVE A WEAPON.

581
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
AND I THINK THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

582
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
IT'S WHY WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE

583
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
THIS.
IT'S WHY DOCTORS CAN'T DO THEIR

584
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
JOBS AND WHY PARENT ARE STUCK

585
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WITH KIDS LIKE THIS AT HOME AND

586
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
WHY WE CAN'T GET ACTION ON GUN

587
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
LAWS.

588
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
>> AND DR. DREW, WHEN YOU'RE

589
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
LOOKING AT ADAM LANZA, WHAT IN

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
HIS MEDICAL HISTORY DO YOU THINK

591
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
INVESTIGATORS SHOULD BE FOCUSING

592
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
MORE ON?

593
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING INTO TO
PAINT A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF

594
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THE PERSON THAT WE ARE TALKING

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ABOUT?
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- AND

596
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
WHAT ABOUT THE TOXICOLOGY

597
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
REPORT?
WHAT SHOULD THEY BE LOOKING AT

598
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
WHEN THAT COMES IN?

599
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

600
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I THINK THE TWO AREAS THAT ARE

601
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
GOING TO GIVE US THE MOST

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
INFORMATION IS HIS LIFE ONLINE

603
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
BECAUSE VERY OFTEN PEOPLE THAT

604
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
HAVE ARE DIFFICULTY WITH
INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH OTHERS,

605
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
THEY HAVE QUITE A RICH LIFE OUT

606
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THERE IN THE CYBERSPACE AND IT

607
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
CAN BE BIZARRE AND THEY CAN FUEL

608
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SOME OF THESE HORRIBLE SORTS OF

609
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
PREOCCUPATIONS AND VIOLENT

610
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TENDENCIES.

611
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
IT DOESN'T CAUSE THEM BUT THE

612
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
ONLINE LIFE IS GOING TO BE VERY

613
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
REVEALING AND FOR SURE THE TOX

614
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
KOLGS ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL.
THERE'S TWO BIG QUESTIONS HERE.

615
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
DID SOMEHOW THE MEDICATION

616
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
EITHER COMING ON OR GOING OFF,

617
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
MAYBE HE WAS PRESCRIBED

618
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
MEDICATION AND DIDN'T TAKE IT.

619
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO FIND A LACK OF

620
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
MEDICATION IN HIS SYSTEM OR, GOD

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
FORBID, HE GOT ON TO SOME

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
ILLICIT SUBSTANCES, LIKE A

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
METHAMPHETAMINE AND THAT COULD

624
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
EASILY EXPLAIN HOW SOMEBODY

625
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
COULD FLIP INTO THIS KIND OF AN

626
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AGITATED STATE.

627
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
>> AND LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE

628
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
COMMUNITY HERE, WE KNOW SOME
STUDENTS ARE HEADING BACK TO

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SCHOOL.
WE HEARD SOME PARENTS HOW

630
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
DIFFICULT IT IS IS FOR THE KIDS

631
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TO BE HEADING BACK TO SCHOOL.

632
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
THE YOUNG CHILDREN AT SANDY
HOOK, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

633
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
STARTING BACK TO CLASS UNTIL

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
AFTER THE HOLIDAY BREAK IN

635
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
JANUARY.
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHEN DO

636
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
YOU THINK IT IS THE RIGHT TIME

637
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
FOR CHILDREN TO BE GOING BACK TO

638
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
CLASS AFTER THEY'VE EXPERIENCED

639
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
SUCH TRAUMA AT SCHOOL?

640
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
>> YEAH: TO COME EXTENT, WE HAVE

641
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
TO KIND OF LEAVE IT UP TO THE

642
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
KIDS A LITTLE BIT.

643
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
IF THEY REALLY FEEL

644
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
UNCOMFORTABLE LEAVING THE HOME

645
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
AND WANT TO STAY WITH THEIR

646
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
FAMILY, THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD

647
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
DO.

648
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I DEFINITELY THINK HOLIDAY AT

649
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY, SAFETY,

650
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
NORMALCY BACK IN THEIR LIFE,

651
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THERE IS IS QUESTION WHETHER

652
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THEY SHOULD GO BACK INTO THAT

653
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT WHERE

654
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THAT HAPPENED.

655
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
SOME KIDS MAY WANT TO DO THAT TO

656
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
REGAIN A MASTER REE WHAT

657
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
HAPPENED TO THEM.

658
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
OTHERS MAY BE MORTIFIED AND

659
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TRIGGERED BY IT AND SHOULD NOT

660
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
BE FORCED TO DO SO.
ULTIMATELY EACH CHILD IS GOING

661
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TO DEAL WITH IT DIFFERENTLY.
TRAUMA AND GRIEF ARE CHAOTIC

662
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
EXPERIENCES.
EACH OF US OUT THERE, I

663
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
CHALLENGE ANY ONE OF YOU WHO HAS

664
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
BEEN WATCHING THIS STORY NOT TO
AGREE WITH ME THAT THE FEELINGS

665
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
THAT WASH OVER US ARE CHAOTIC

666
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
AND UNPREDICTABLE AND RANGE FROM

667
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
RAGE TO MISERY TO SADNESS TO

668
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DISGUST AND THAT'S NORMAL.

669
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO

670
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
CONTINUE TO RUSH OVER US FOR

671
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
WEEKS TO COME AND IT'S INCUMBENT

672
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
UPON US TO TAKE ACTION, SERVICE

673
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WILL HELP US, CREATE SOME

674
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
CONCEPT OF FAITH, WHATEVER THAT

675
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
CONCEPT IS FOR YOU AND THEN

676
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
FINALLY CONNECT WITH PEOPLE THAT

677
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
LOVE YOU AND KNOW YOU.

678
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
STAY WITH THEM AND STAY CLOSE TO

679
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THEM.

680
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> DR. DREW, WHAT SHOULD PARENTS

681
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
BE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW?

682
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
BECAUSE SOMETIMES TRAUMA --

683
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER,

684
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THAT TAKES A WHILE TO GO INTO

685
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
EFFECT.
WHAT ARE THE SIGNS THAT PARENTS

686
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WITH THEIR

687
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
KIDS RIGHT NOW?

688
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
>> YEAH.
LISTEN, ALL OF US -- AND

689
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN PROXIMITY

690
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
TO THE TRAUMA -- ARE GOING TO

691
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
HAVE AN ACUTE STRESS REACTION
AND THAT IS NORMAL.

692
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOUR

693
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
VIEWERS NOTICE YOU'RE NOT

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
SLEEPING RIGHT, YOU'RE

695
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
PREOCCUPIED SLEEPING ABOUT THIS

696
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THING.

697
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
YOU MAY HAVE CHAOTIC FEELINGS

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THAT COME OVER YOU.

699
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
YOU MAY HAVE PANIC IF YOU'RE

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
PREDISPOSED TO THAT.

701
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THIS IS THE TIME TO INTERVENE,

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
RIGHT NOW, SO THIS DOES NOT

703
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
PROGRESS TO A POSTTRAUMATIC

704
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
STRESS DISORDER WHICH IS AN

705
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ONGOING PERSISTENT DISORDER THAT

706
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF
SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND TREATMENT

707
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

708
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
KIDS MAY REGRESS, THE YOUNGER

709
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
KIDS MAY RETURN TO THINGS LIKE

710
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WETTING THEIR BED, THEY MAY

711
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
WITHDRAW, MAY BE AGITATED, MAY

712
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
HAVE A CHANGE IN THEIR EATING

713
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
HABITS.
THE ONE CAVEAT THAT I GIVE TO

714
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
PARENTS DO NOT EXPECT YOUR KIDS

715
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND PROCESS.

716
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
KIDS TRY TO PAK SENSE OF THINGS

717
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
LET THEM GO ABOUT IT THEIR OWN

719
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WAY.

720
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I HEARD A BEAUTIFUL WAY OF

721
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
CONCEPTUALIZING, THAT GOD NEEDED

722
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
SOME WONDERFUL ANGELS AND HE
CALLED FOR THEM AND HE HAS THIS

723
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
LOVELY GROUP OF ANGELS WITH

724
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
THEM.

725
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
HE NEEDED THEM, HE ASKED FOR

726
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THEM, AND HE GOT THEM.

727
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
AND THAT CHILD WAS GIVEN A GIFT,

728
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
A WAY TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND

729
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT IS

730
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
FRANKLY NOT ABLE TO BE
UNDERSTOOD IN ANY RATIONAL WAY

731
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
BECAUSE THIS WAS A COMPLETELY

732
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
IRRATIONAL ACT.

Like a lot of things,

748

trying to find a better job can
be frustrating.

749
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So at University of Phoenix
we're working with a growing

750
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
list of almost two thousand
corporate partners -

751
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
companies like Microsoft,
American Red Cross and Adobe -

752
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to create options for you.

753
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Not only that, we're using what
we learn from these partners

754
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
to shape our curriculum, so that
when you find the job you want

755

FOR ALMOST A MONTH AND IT COULD

816
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
FALL TO LEVELS NOT SEEN IN TWO

817

BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.

MY COPD SYMPTOMS

827
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS

828
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS.

829
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
PLUS, IT REDUCES COPD FLARE-UPS.

830
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY ONCE-DAILY

831
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
INHALED COPD MAINTENANCE
TREATMENT THAT DOES BOTH.

BROMIDE INHALATION POWDER

833
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
DOES NOT REPLACE FAST-ACTING
INHALERS FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

834
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
KIDNEY PROBLEMS, GLAUCOMA,

835
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
TROUBLE URINATING, OR
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

836

THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.

837
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

838
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND SEEK
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

839
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
IF YOUR BREATHING
SUDDENLY WORSENS,

840
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE
SWELLS, YOU GET HIVES,

841
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
VISION CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.

842
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000

NOTHING CAN REVERSE COPD.

SPIRIVA HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER.

(BLOWING SOUND)

847
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SPIRIVA.

848
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000

MORE ABOUT THE 6-YEAR-OLDS WHO

LOVED LIFE SO MUCH.

872
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THE FIRST ONE IS JAMES MATTIOLI.

873
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
HE WAS 6 YEARS OLD AND WAS

874
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HE WOULD OFTEN SING AT THE TOP

882
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HE LOVED DIVING INTO POOL,

883
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
RIDING HIS BICYCLE AND HE WAS

884
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
PROUD THAT HE DIDN'T NEED

885
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TRAINING WHEELS AND WE CAN ALL

886
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE THAT AGE

887
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
AND ONCE YOU DIDN'T NEED

888
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
TRAINING WHEELS, WE WERE ALL

889
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
LITTLE TYKES THEM.

890
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
ALSO, JESSICA REKOS WAS KNOWN AS

891
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THE CEO OF HER FAMILY.

892
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THEY CALLED HER THE BOSS.

893
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SHE RULED THE ROOST.
SHE WAS A BALL OF FIRE AND A

BUT THIS CHRISTMAS, ACCORDING TO

898
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000

BADLY AND WHO WAS GOING TO GET

906
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
COWGIRL BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS

907
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
ISN'T COMING HOME.

908
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> AND OF COURSE, THAT'S THE

909
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
MOM.

910
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THE MOM'S NAME IS CHRISTINA.

911
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW SHE WAS EVEN

912
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
ABLE TO GARNER THE STRENGTH TO

913
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
DO THAT INTERVIEW.

914
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
BUT, AGAIN, THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW

915
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
YOU SEE HERE WHO ARE PAYING

916
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THEIR TRIBUTES IN THEIR OWN WAY,

917
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

918
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
ABLE TO GO TO THE FUNERAL TODAY,

919
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
THEY ARE DROPPING OFF FLOWERS

920
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000

921
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
EACH OTHER AND THIS MEMORIAL,

THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM, WOLF,

923
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THAT YOU AND I HAVE SEEN.

924
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ONE OF THEM THAT IS JUST

925
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000

THEIR SUPPORT AND TO REALLY HUG

929
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000

EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN

COMING UP TO US HAS BEEN WANTING

931
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
TO HUG US SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
WE'RE GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE.
USUALLY WHEN THE MEDIA COMES TO

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
TOWN WE'RE NOT SO HAPPY TO SEE

934
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WORLD THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS NOT

GOING TO BE REMEMBERED FOR A

938
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
TRAGIC EVENT BUT REMEMBERED FOR

939
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THE LOVE THAT THEY SHOWED EACH

940
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000

THEY'VE ERECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF

942
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
NEWTOWN.
>> DON, YOU'VE DEFINITELY BEEN

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
SPEAKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM

944
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THE TOWN AND MANY PEOPLE COMING

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
IN FROM OUT OF TOWN TO SHOW

946
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
THEIR SUPPORT.

947
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM FOLKS

948
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ABOUT WHERE THINGS GO FROM HERE,

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OR EVEN IN THE SHORT TERM BEING

950
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WHAT THE NEXT TWO WEEKS LOOKS

951
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
LIKE.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DON'T

952
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
KNOW.
OF COURSE, TWO MORE TODAY AND

953
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000

958
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PROCESSIONS CAME BY TODAY AND

959
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
YOU COULD SEE THE PEOPLE IN THAT

960
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
PROCESSION.
YOU COULD SEE THE HERSES AND THE

961
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
MOVING TRUCKS, YOU AND I SAW

962
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THAT, THEY WERE MOVING THE

963
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THINGS FROM THIS SCHOOL TO THE

964
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
OTHER SCHOOL WHERE IT'S GOING TO

965
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
BE TEMPORARILY.

966
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THEY PASSED EACH OTHER AND IT

967
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
WAS QUITE A THING TO SEE ONE

968
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THING MOVING ON AND THE OTHER

969
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THING, THE PARENTS AND FAMILY

970
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
MEMBERS AND LOVED ONES GOING TO

971
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
LAY THEIR LITTLE LOVED ONES TO
REST.

972
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
IT WAS -- IT WAS JUST

973
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE.

974
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE WORDS FOR

975
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
IT, KATE.
>> SO HEARTBREAKING FOR ALL OF

976
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
US.
DON IS GOING TO BE BACK IN THE

977
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
NEXT HOUR.
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS

978
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
CONVERSATION.

979
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
HERE'S THE QUESTION.

980
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
IS THE WHITE HOUSE READY TO GET

981
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
SERIOUS ABOUT GUN CONTROL?

982
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
IF SO, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS

983
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
SECRETARY TODAY GAVE US A LITTLE

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
BIT OF AN IDEA ABOUT HOW THE

985
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO RESPOND.

986
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
STAND BY.
ASKS WHAT IT FEELS

987
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
TO DRIVE A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE,

988
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
TELL THEM
IT'S LIKE BEING NESTLED

989
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
IN AN EIGHT-WAY, ADJUSTABLE,
HEATED AND VENTILATED SEAT

990
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
SURROUNDED BY A 500-WATT
SOUND SYSTEM

991
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WHILE FLOATING ON A SUSPENSION
MADE OF BILLOWY CLOUDS.

992
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OR YOU COULD JUST HAND THEM
YOUR KEYS.

993
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000

994
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000

>>> BEFORE FRIDAY'S APPALLING

996
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
GUN VIOLENCE, GUN CONTROL WAS

997
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ALMOST ON NOBODY'S AGENDA IN

998
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
WASHINGTON BUT NOW IT HAS BECOME
A PRIORITY FOR MANY LAWMAKERS.

999
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
BRIANNA KEILAR IS JOINING US

1000
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WITH MORE ON THIS DEBATE.

1001
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
WHERE IS IT HEADING, BRIANNA?

UP.
THE NRA IS HAVING A PRESS

CONFERENCE TOMORROW.

1005
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THAT'S ALSO A SIGN THAT THIS

1006
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
DEBATE IS HEATING UP AND IT'S NO

1007
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000

DETAILING SOME OF THE STEPS IT

TODAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE

1011
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
WHITE HOUSE GOT SPECIFIC ON HOW

1012
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL TACKLE GUN

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000

MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES RIGHT

1017
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
NOW?
>> WELL, HE IS ACTIVELY

1018
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
SUPPORTIVE OF, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REINSTATE

1022

SAYS THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO

1024
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
CLOSE THE GUN LOOPHOLE AND LOOK

1025
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
AT MEASURES THAT ADDRESS MENTAL

1026
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000

1027
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
CRITICS HAVE SAID THAT THE

1028
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
PRESIDENT HAS NOT LED ON GUN

1029
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
RIGHTS AND THEY SAY IT'S TIME TO

1030
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
FIND A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION.

1031
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
>> I THINK MOST REPUBLICANS ARE

1032
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THIS INTO A POLITICAL THEATER

1037
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
THING.
>> Reporter: BUT THE PRESIDENT

1038
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
IS APPEARING TO ACT MORE

1039
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
AGGRESSIVELY ON THE ISSUE.

1040
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
HE CALLED WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR
JOE MANCHIN, A PRO-GUN RIGHTS

1041
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
DEMOCRAT WHO ONCE STARTED HIS

1042
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
OWN CAMPAIGN AD PUSHED BY

1043
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
HE SAYS IT'S TIME TO ACT ON

1044
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
VIOLENCE.

1045
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH VICE

ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.

1049
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
A DEMONSTRATION OF THE

1050
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THE
PRESIDENT WANTS TO TAKE IN

1051
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
COMBATTING THE PROBLEM.

1052
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
OBSERVERS OF THIS DEBATE ALSO

1053
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
SAY PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD EXERT

1054
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO

1055
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
BYPASS CONGRESS AND DO SOME

1056
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
THINGS ON HIS OWN.
THAT COULD INCLUDE SHARE

1057
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
INFORMATION, A BETTER SHARING OF

1058
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
INFORMATION BETWEEN FEDERAL,

1059
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
STATE, AND LOCAL LAW

1060
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
ENFORCEMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL

1061
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
ILLEGAL GUN PURCHASES.

1062
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I MENTIONED WE TALKED ABOUT THAT
GUN CONFERENCE.

1063
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
THAT WAS ON FRIDAY, NOT

1064
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
TOMORROW.

1065
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I MISSPOKE.

1066
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
>> THEY JUST ISSUED A STATEMENT,

1067
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
BRIANNA.

1068
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1069
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THAT GUN CONTROL DEBATE IS ABOUT

1070
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
TO INTEN FI BIG TIME IN

1071
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
WASHINGTON.
>>> THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAD NO

1072
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
IDEA THAT THEY WERE KICKING A

1073
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
HORNET'S NEST BY GUARANTEEING

1074
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO BEAR

1075
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
ARMS.

1076
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
THEY STARTED A FIERCE DEBATE

1077
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THAT GOES ON TODAY.

1078
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

1079
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS COMING UP

1080
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
WITH JEFFREY TOOBIN.

1081
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>>> ALSO, ADAM LANZA HAS BEEN

1082
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
DESCRIBED AS A LONER AND ONE MAN

1083
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
IS DESCRIBING ABOUT THIS MAN

1084
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000

MOST RECENTLY IN 2008.

1138
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
>> VERY DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT

1139
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
INTERPRETATIONS.
BEFORE 2008, FOR 100 YEARS, THAT

1140
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
FIRST CLAUSE, THE SO-CALLED

1141

1143

1145
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THAT AMENDMENT WAS INTERPRETED

1146
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
FOR DECADES AS GIVING

1147
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
INDIVIDUALS NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND

1149
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
IN 2008, THAT CHANGED ON A DIME.

THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

1151
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
IN A DECISION CALLED HELLAR SAID

1152
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT GIVES

1153
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
INDIVIDUALS THE RIGHT TO KEEP

1154
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000

1155
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
WHERE YOU GET TO KEEP THEM,

1156
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000

>> SO WHAT RESTRICTS ARE LEGAL?

1159
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
>> WELL, LET'S START WITH WHAT

1160
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
RESTRICTS WE KNOW ARE ILLEGAL.

1161
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
IT IS ILLEGAL NOW FOR A

1162
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
GOVERNMENT, A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

1163
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BAN

1164
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
THE POSSESSION OF HANDGUNS

1165
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
WITHIN THE HOME.

1166
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
THAT IS WHAT THE HELLER CASE WAS

1167
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
ABOUT.
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO THAT.

1168
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
BUT IT STARTS TO GET MURKIER

1169
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
WHEN IT'S ABOUT OTHER WEAPONS

1170
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THAN HANDGUNS AND OUTSIDE THE

1171
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
HOME.

1172
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, SEMIAUTOMATIC

1173
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
WEAPONS, ASSAULT RIFLES, THOSE

1174
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
CAN BE REGULATED.

1175
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THEY CAN BE

1176
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
REGULATED IN TERMS OF CAN YOU

1177
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
HAVE CONCEALED, CARRY THEM IN A

1178
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
CONCEALED WAY OR CARRY THEM

1179
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
OPENLY IS ALSO AN OPEN QUESTION.

1180
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
BUT THIS IS AN AREA OF WHERE THE

1181
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
LAW IS CHANGING A LOT AND TENDS

1182
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
TO BE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF

1183
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
LESS REGULATION OF FIREARMS.

1184
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
SO THAT'S SOMETHING CONGRESS IS

1185
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IF

1186
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
AND WHEN IT DECIDES TO PASS ANY

1187
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000

1195
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000

1201

INVADE PEOPLE'S PRIVACY BY

1210
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000

1215
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000

1217
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
BUT IT MIGHT BE POLITICALLY
SIGNIFICANT.

1218
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
YOU KNOW, GUN OWNERS ARE A VERY

1219
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
POWERFUL GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY

1220
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000

1221

THEIR PRIVACY INFRINGED ON SO

1222
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THAT'S ONE ARGUMENT USED AGAINST

1223
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
ANY SORT OF GUN CONTROL.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A

1224
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT BUT IT'S
A POLITICAL ARGUMENT THAT A LOT

1225
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OF PEOPLE -- IT CARRIES A LOT OF

1226
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
WEIGHT.

1231
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
LIMITATIONS THAT CAN BE IMPOSED.

1232
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
WHAT THEY ARE IS WHAT SOCIETY

1233
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
UNDERSTANDS ARE REASONABLE

1234
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
LIMITATIONS.
THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO

1235
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
ARMS THAT CANNOT BE CARRIED.

1236
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
IT DOESN'T APPLY TO CANONS.

1237
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I SUPPOSE THERE ARE HANDHELD

1238

ROCKET LAUNCHES THAT CAN BRING

1239
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
DOWN AIRPLANES.

1240
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
IT WILL HAVE TO BE DECIDED.

1241

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
WHAT KIND OF GUN RESTRICTS

1243
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
JUSTICE SCALIA MIGHT BE OPEN TO

1244
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
IN.
>> NOT MANY, IT SOUNDS LIKE.

1245
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
REMEMBER, HE SAID HAND HELD LIKE

1246
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
STIN GSTIN GER MISSILES.

1247
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
MAYBE YES, MAYBE NOT.
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST TALKING

1248
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
OFF THE CUFF BUT IT'S INDICATIVE

1249
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
OF HOW UP IN THE AIR THE RULES

1250
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
ARE HERE.
I THINK MOST OF US ASSUME THAT

1251
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THE GOVERNMENT CAN BAN STINGER

1252
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
MISSILES.

1253
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
IF YOU'RE STANDING BY AN AIRPORT
WITH A MISSILE THAT CAN SHOOT

1254
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
DOWN A PLANE, I THINK MOST OF US

1255
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ARE RECOGNIZED THAT THAT'S

1256
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT

1257
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
CAN REGULATE.

1258
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
BUT JUSTICE SCALIA SEEMS UP IN

1259
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THE AIR ABOUT IT.

1260
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I THINK THAT IS JUST AN

1261
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
INDICATION OF HOW MUCH THE

1262

1440
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
AMONG THE STEADY STREAM OF

1441
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
PEOPLE DRAWN TO THIS MEMORIAL

1442
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
HONORING VICTIMS, A FORMER

1443
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
SCHOOLMATE OF THE ALLEGED

1444
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
KILLER.
WHEN YOU THINK OF THIS, DOES

1445
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
YOUR MIND ALSO GO TO YOUR

1446
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
FRIEND?

1447
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
>> OBVIOUSLY IT DOES BECAUSE,

1448
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
YOU KNOW, HE'S A VERY BIG PART

1449
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
IN THIS EVENT.

1450
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO

1451
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
THINK OF IT.
>> SADLY, HE'S THE REASON FOR

1452
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
IT.
>> YEAH.
>> YEAH.

1453
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
>> ALAN DIAZ, WHEN HE WAS A

1454
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
SOPHOMORE AT NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL

1455
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
AND DIAZ WAS A FRESHMAN IN 2008.

1456
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
>> HE WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT

1457
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
PERSON.
THE WAY HE ACTED AROUND OTHER

1458
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
PEOPLE WAS JUST VERY WITHDRAWN

1459
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
AND JUST VERY QUIET.

1460
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
>> A LITTLE DIFFERENT?

1461
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
>> YEAH.

1462
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
>> THEY WERE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

1463
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
TECH CLASS TOGETHER, SPENT A LOT

1464
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
OF TIME ON COMPUTERS.

1465
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
ADAM HAD HIS OWN STYLE OF

1466
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
DRESSING.
>> HE HAD LIKE THE STIR OHIO

1467
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
TYPICAL NERD LOOK, LIKE KHAKI

1468
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
PANTS, BELT, TUCKED IN SHIRT,

1469
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
EVEN HAD LIKE A LITTLE COMPUTER

1470
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
CASE, A BRIEFCASE INSTEAD OF A
BACKPACK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,

1471
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
EVEN A POCKET PROTECTOR THAT HE

1472
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
HAD PENS IN.

1473
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
>> HE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER LANZA

1474
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
WAS BULLIED.
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

1475
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
>> WE ALL KIND OF KNEW THAT HE

1476
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
HAD PROBLEMS SOCIALLY AND WE

1477
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
KIND OF HAD A FEELING THAT THERE

1478
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WRONG

1479
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
WITH HIM BUT OBVIOUSLY WE NEVER

1480
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
ASKED.
WE NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS OUR

1481
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
PLACE TO DO SO.

1482
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
>> BACK THEN, HIS SCHOOLMATE'S

1483
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
MOM INVITED THEM OVER TO THE

1484
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
HOUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

1485
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
ONE WAS STARCRAFT, KIND OF A WAR

1486
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
GAMES IN SPACE.

1487
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
ANOTHER WAS WAR CRAFT 3 WHERE,

1488
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
AS THE AD SAYS, SURVIVAL IS A

1489
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
MATTER OF STRATEGY.

1490
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
>> WAR CRAFT 3 BASS REALWAS REA.

1491
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
HE ACTUALLY PICKED UP ON STAR

1492
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
CRAFT VERY QUICKLY.

1493
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
>> Reporter: WHEN LANZA QUIT

1494
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS HOME

1495
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
SCHOOLED, HE LOST TOUCH.

1496
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
>> I REMEMBER HER MENTIONING

1497
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
THAT HE STARTED GOING TO THE

1498
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
SHOOTING RANGE WITH HER AND MY

1499
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
INITIAL RESPONSE TO THAT WAS, I

1500
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
NEVER REALLY IMAGINED ADAM ONE

1501
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
TO EVEN HOLD A GUN.

1502
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT IN.

1503
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1504
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
MAYBE BECAUSE IN MY MIND I DON'T

1505
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
IMAGINE SHY, QUIET PEOPLE GOING

1506
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
TO A SHOOTING RANGE.

1507
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I NEVER REALLY CAN MAKE THAT

1508
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
ASSOCIATION.
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE TRACKING

1509
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
HOW OFTEN LANZA HAD BEEN TO GUN

1510
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
RANGES.

1511
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
THEY DON'T YET KNOW HOW MANY SO

1512
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
FAR.
THEY'VE PROVEN THAT HE WAS AT

1513
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
TARGET PRACTICE SIX MONTHS AGO

1514
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS MOTHER AND

1515
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
SON WENT AT LEAST ONCE TOGETHER.

1516
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
ALAN'S OLDER SISTER WENT TO

1517
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
SCHOOL WITH THE SHOOTER'S OLDER

1518
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
BROTHER AND FRIENDS WITH HIS

1519
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
MOTHER WHO WENT TO HER BRIDAL

1520
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
SHOWER LAST YEAR.

1521
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
>> WHY HER?

1522
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
SHE WAS JUST -- THANK YOU.

1523
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
YEAH.
IT WAS A SHOCK.

1524
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
ALWAYS A HAPPY PERSON.

1525
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
>> DO YOU NOW THINK OF HIM AS AN

1526
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
EVIL PERSON BECAUSE OF WHAT HE

1527
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
DID IN.
>> AT ONE POINT HE WAS A GOOD

1528
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
KID.
THE EVENTS THAT HE DID THAT DAY

1529
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
MAY HAVE BEEN EVIL BUT BEFORE

1530
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
THEN HE WAS JUST ANOTHER KID.

1531
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
>> UNTIL SOMETHING MADE HIM

1532
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
SNAP.
NOW PERHAPS, WOLF, PERHAPS WE

1533
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
MIGHT GET SOME ANSWERS FROM

1534
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
TOXICOLOGY TESTS.
THIS IS BLOOD WORK THAT THE

1535
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE IS

1536
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
DOING AS PART OF THE AUTOPSY

1537
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
WHICH MIGHT TELL US WHETHER HE

1538
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
HAD ANY DRUGS OR CHEMICALS IN

1539
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
HIS SYSTEM, ADAM LANZA.

1540
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
HOWEVER, THERE IS ANOTHER

1541
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
TROUBLING ASPECT OF THIS
INVESTIGATION.

1542
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
WE ARE HEARING THAT THE
COMPUTERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

1543
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
BEING ANALYZED BY THE STATE

1544
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
POLICE WITH HELP FROM THE FBI,

1545
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
THAT THERE IS IS DIFFICULTY

1546
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
DOING THAT, HAVING A HARD TIME

1547
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WAS SO

1548
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
BADLY SMASHED AND THE HARD DRIVE

1549
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
NEARLY DESTROYED THAT

1550
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE HAVING A VERY

1551
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO

1552
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
RETRIEVE ANY INFORMATION FROM

1553
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
IT.
INFORMATION, FOR EXAMPLE, ON

1554
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
WHAT INTERNET SITES HE MIGHT

1555
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
HAVE VISITED, ANY E-MAILS HE

1556
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
MIGHT HAVE SET, ANY WEBSITES HE

1557
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
MIGHT HAVE VISITED.

1558
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
AND SO THAT, TOO, MIGHT HAVE

1559
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
GIVEN THEM ANSWERS BUT NOW WE

1560
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
DON'T KNOW KNOW WHETHER THEY

1561
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

1562
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
WOLF?

1563
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
>> LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE
EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THERE'S

1564
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
STILL SO MUCH MORE TO LEARN.

1565
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, THANK YOU.

1566
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
>>> TODAY, CONNECTICUT'S

1567
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
GOVERNOR SIGNED A PROCLAMATION

1568
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
TO MAKE THIS FRIDAY A STATE OF

1569
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
MOURNING.
HE'S ASKING FOR A MOMENT OF

1570
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
SILENCE AT 9:30 A.M.

1571
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT

1572
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
ADAM LANZA SHOWED UP AT THE

1573
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
SCHOOL AND STARTED SHOOTING.

1574
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
TODAY I SPOKE WITH THE MAN WHO

1575
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
HAS BECOME THE PUBLIC FACE OF

1576
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
THIS INVESTIGATION, THE

1577
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

1578
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
LIEUTENANT, PAUL VANCE.

1579
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
>> LIEUTENANT VANCE, IN YOUR

1580
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
39-YEAR CAREER, HOW DO YOU

1581
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
PREPARE FOR THE ENORMITY OF A

1582
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS?

1583
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
>> TRAINING.

1584
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
TRAINING.
CONSTANT, CONSTANT TRAINING,

1585
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
THINGS YOU HOPE YOU WILL NEVER

1586
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
HAVE TO USE, JUST LIKE THE SIDE

1587
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
ARM, YOU HOPE YOU NEVER WILL

1588
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
HAVE TO USE IT.

1589
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
YOU HAVE TO TRAIN, YOU HAVE TO

1590
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
PREPARE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET TO

1591
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
A SCENE OR A SITUATION, EVEN A

1592
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
SCENE OF THIS MA NA TUD, YOU

1593
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
HAVE TO ACT.

1594
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
THERE'S NO TIME.
>> BECAUSE YOU HAVE EMERGED AS

1595
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN.

1596
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
YOU ARE TELLING PEOPLE NOT ONLY

1597
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
HERE BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD

1598
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.
IT MUST TAKE A TOLL ON YOU.

1599
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
>> IT DOES.

1600
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
BUT OUR TRAINING PREPARES US TO

1601
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES, TO GO

1602
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS

1603
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
DEVASTATING.

1604
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
IT'S TRULY DEVASTATING BECAUSE

1605
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
WE'RE ONLY HUMAN AND WE THINK

1606
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
ABOUT THE FAMILIES.

1607
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
WE THINK ABOUT THESE CHILDREN.

1608
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
WE THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT

1609
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
LOST THEIR LIVES.

1610
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
WE THINK ABOUT THE TEACHERS THAT

1611
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
PROTECTED THEIR CHILDREN.

1612
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
AND ALL THOSE THINGS, YOU'RE

1613
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
PROCESSING BUT YOU HAVE TO SHOVE

1614
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
IT ASIDE AND MOVE FORWARD AND DO

1615
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
WHAT YOU'RE TRAINED TO DO.

1616
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
>> AND YOU MET WITH THESE

1617
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
FAMILIES OF THESE 26 VICTIMS, 20

1618

KIDS, SIX EDUCATORS.

1619
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
THAT MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT THINGS YOU'VE EVER

1620
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
DONE IN YOUR LIFE.

1621
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
>> I WAS PART OF IT BUT, QUITE

1622
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
FRANKLY, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

1623
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
ASSIGNED TO WORK WITH THEM AND

1624
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
THE ONE ON ONES, IF YOU WILL,

1625
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
THE INTERVIEWERS THAT HAD TO

1626
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
INTERVIEW PEOPLE, THOSE ARE

1627
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
VERY, VERY HARD JOBS, VERY HARD

1628
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
THINGS TO DO.

1629
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT

1630
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
HAVE PLAYED SUCH A MAJOR ROLE IN

1631
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
THIS WHOLE SITUATION THAT IT

1632
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
SPREAD AMONGST MANY.

1633
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
>> WAS THERE -- I KNOW THE WHOLE

1634
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
THING HAS BEEN PAINFUL.

1635
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
IT'S BEEN PAINFUL FOR ALL OF US.

1636
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE

1637
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH.

1638
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
BUT WAS THERE ONE MOMENT IN YOUR

1639
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
MIND THAT STANDS OUT THAT YOU
WILL NEVER FORGET THE REST OF

1640
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
YOUR LIFE?
>> I THINK THE CRIME SCENE

1641
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

1642
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK.

1643
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL

1644
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
NEVER BE ABLE TO ERASE.

1645
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
>> YOU MEAN WHEN YOU WALKED INTO

1646
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000

SCHOOL AND YOU SAW BODIES OF

1648
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
LITTLE KIDS ON THE FLOOR?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1649
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
YES.
>> HOW CAN YOU EVEN -- THAT MUST

1650
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
BE SO SHOCKING.

1651
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
THAT MUST BE SO TRAUMATIC.

1652
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
>> IT'S AN INLEGALABLE MARK THAT

1653
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
WILL NEVER GO AWAY.

1654
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
>> YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE

1655
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
THAT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE?

1656
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
>> NO.
>> AND YOU'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF

1657
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
CRIME SCENES?

1658
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
>> YES.

1659
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
>> THIS WAS THE WORST BY FAR?

1660
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
>> YES.
>> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS

1661
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

1662
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

1663
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I KNOW THAT.

1664
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
YOU KNOW THAT.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE

1665
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
CHANCES OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN?

1666
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
>> WELL, I THINK EVERYONE'S

1667

FIRE DRILLS, WE PREPARE FOR

1671
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
EMERGENCIES IN THE SCHOOL.

1672
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I THINK THAT'S A CONSTANT THING

1673
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO DO IN

1674
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000

CAN MAKE THEM.

1679
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
WE HAVE TO.
WE WORKED THROUGH 9/11 AND WE

1680
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
CONTINUED.

1681
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
LIFE WENT ON.

1682
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I DON'T WANT TO SIMPLIFY
ANYTHING BUT WE'VE GOT TO WORK

1683

THROUGH THIS.

COMMISSION TO TAKE A LOOK AT

1685

And cut! Very good.

1718
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1719
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1720
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1721
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's not real.

1722
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1723
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1724
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1725
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,

1901
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
IT WAS A BIG GUN AND A SMALL GUN

1902
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000

SAID THERE WAS BLOOD.

AND THEN THEY SAID HER NAME AND

1905
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000

01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000

SIX WERE MURDERED IN ARIZONA AND

01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
IN EACH CASE, THE SHOOTERS

2034
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
SHOWED PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIOR.

2035

ONE WAS A TEXTBOOK PSYCHOPATH

2038
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
AND WE KNOW NOW HE EVEN LAUGHED

2039
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
WHILE GUNNING DOWN HIS VICTIMS.

2040
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
LOOKING BACK, NONE OF THEM HAD

2041
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
SNAPPED.

2042
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
THEY HAD ALL LEFT CLUES PIECED

2043
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
TOGETHER AFTER IT WAS TOO LATE.

2044
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
HINDSIGHT.

2045
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
WE STILL DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

2046
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
THIS SHOOTER THAT LIVED IN THIS

2047
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
HOME BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE

2048
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
TO CONSIDER, WHAT MEDICATIONS,

2049
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
IF ANY, HE WAS ON.

2050
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT

2051
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

2052
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
IF YOU LOOK AT HOW OTHER

2053
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
SHOOTINGS LIKE THIS HAVE
HAPPENED, MEDICATIONS WERE A

2054
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
COMMON FACTOR.

2055
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, NOT THAT

2056
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS CAN'T BE

2057
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
EFFECTIVE BUT THERE'S A

2058
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
VULNERABLE TIME BETWEEN WHEN

2059
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
SOMEONE STARTS AND STOPS THESE

2060
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
MEDICATIONS, COULD LEAD TO

2061
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
DECREASED JUDGMENT AND MAKING

2062
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
SOMEONE OUT OF TOUCH.

2063
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
NONE OF THIS IS AN EXECUTION AND

2064
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
IT'S NEVER JUST ONE THING.

2065
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
NONE OF THESE BEHAVIORS WILL

2066
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
FULLY PREDICT OR EXPLAIN WHY.

2067
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
BUT SOON AGAIN THERE WILL BE

2068
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
HINDSIGHT THAT MIGHT JUST HELP

BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN LAID TO REST.

2147
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
>> JAMES MATTIOLI WAS FOUNDLY

2148
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000

01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
SISTER ANNA.
HE WOULD OFTEN SING AT THE TOP

2151
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
OF HIS LUNGS AND ASKED HOW OLD

2152
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
HE WOULD HAVE TO BE TO PERFORM

2153
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000

HE ALSO LOVED THE OUTDOORS,

2154

DIVING INTO THE POOL, AND RIDING

2155
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000

PROUD THAT HE DIDN'T NEED

2156
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
TRAINING WHEELS ANYMORE.

2157
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000

01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000

KILLER'S AT THE COLUMBINE IN

01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
1999 AND ESCAPED TO SAFETY.

2176
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
>> I WAS IN THE LIBRARY WHEN

2177
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
THEY CAME IN AND JUST STARTED

2178
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
SHOOTING AND SETTING OFF BOMBS.

2179
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE WANTED

2180
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
TO DO THIS THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

2181
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE

2186
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
FOUR DAYS AFTER THE COLUMBINE

2187
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
MASSACRE, HOW YOU FELT THEN?

2188
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
>> WOLF, IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER

2189
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
THE SPECIFIC DAYS.

2190
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I FEEL LIKE IN THE IMMEDIATE

2191
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
DAYS FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING AT

2192
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
COLUMBINE, THE DAYS BLURRED

2193
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
TOGETHER.
IT WAS STILL THAT FEELING OF

2194
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
DISBELIEF AND SHOCK, COMPLETE

2195
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
AND UTTER SHOCK.

2196
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
AND AT SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY

2197
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
IT TURNED INTO EXPERIENCING JUST

2198
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
A WIDE RANGE OF EE MOWINGS WITH

2199
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
SUCH INTENSITY, FROM FEAR TO

2200
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
ANGER TO SADNESS TO GUILT.

2201
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
JUST TRYING TO WADE THROUGH

2202
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
THOSE AS A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO

2203
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
HAD FACED REALITY OF DEATH

2204
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,000
UNDERNEATH THE TABLE AT

2205
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
COLUMBINE.
IT'S JUST -- IT WAS SO HARD TO

2206
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
DO AT 16.
I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE

2207
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR THESE

2208
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
KIDS WHO ARE 6 AND 7, JUST MERE

2209
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
BABIES.
>> SO HOW DID YOU LEARN TO COPE

2210
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
WITH THE TRAGEDY THAT YOU

2211
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
EYEWITNESSED?

2212
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
>> FOR ME, I REALLY HAD AN

2213
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
AMAZING SUPPORT SYSTEM.

2214
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
MY FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY OF

2215
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
LITTLETON, MY SCHOOL FRIENDS, OF

2216
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
COURSE THE ADMINISTRATORS,

2217
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
TEACHERS AT COLUMBINE.

2218
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I HAD AN AMAZING CHURCH

2219
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
COMMUNITY.

2220
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
PERSONALLY I HAD FAITH THAT I

2221
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
WAS ABLE TO STAND ON AND NONE OF

2222
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
IT WAS EASY.

2223
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
IT WAS THE DARKEST DAYS OF MY

2224
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
LIFE AS I WAS SCARED TO CLOSE MY

2225
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
EYES BECAUSE I WOULD RELIVE THE

2226
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
EVENTS, I WOULD HEAR THE SOUNDS

2227
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
OF THE GUNS.

2228
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I WOULD HEAR THE KILLERS'

2229
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
VOICES.

2230
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I COULD SMELL THE SMELLS OF THE

2231
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
LIBRARY.
YET IT WAS A JOURNEY.

2232
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
IT WAS A PROCESS.

2233
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE DAY WHERE

2234
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
THINGS SUDDENLY GOT BETTER BUT

2235
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
IT WAS REALLY A PROGRESSION.
IT WAS TIME THAT IT TOOK TO

2236
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
HEAL.
IT WAS COMING TOGETHER AND

2237
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
REALLY SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER.

2238
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
JUST AS I SEE THE PEOPLE OF

2239
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
SANDY HOOK DOING, THE PEOPLE OF

2240
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
NEWTOWN, CONNE

2241
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT LOOK SO

2242
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
CLOSE-KNIT AND THAT'S REALLY
CRUCIAL AT THIS TIME.

2243
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
>> AND ONE THING THAT MANY ARE

2244
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILDREN

2245
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
WHOL SURVIVED THIS TRAGEDY HERE
IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO COPE

2246
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
WHEN THEY REALIZE AND PROBABLY

2247
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
HAVE AT THIS POINT THAT THEY

2248
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
HAVE LOST THEIR FRIENDS, 13

2249
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
PEOPLE WERE KILLED AT COLUMBINE.

2250
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
DID YOU LOSE ANY FRIENDS?
>> I DID.

2251
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I KNEW SEVERAL OF THE STUDENTS,

2252
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
THE TEACHER, MR. SANDERS, HE WAS

2253
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
MY COACH FOR SOFTBALL,

2254
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
BASKETBALL, TRACK.

2255
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
WHAT'S SO HARD IS GOING BACK AND

2256
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
YOU HAVE AN EMPTY CHAIR NEXT TO

2257
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
YOU OR WE GO TO GRADUATION AND

2258
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE

2259
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
CLASSMATES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

2260
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
BE GRADUATING WITH YOU.

2261
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
IT'S -- IT LEAVES A VOID THAT

2262
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
CANNOT BE FILLED AND FOR THESE

2263
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
YOUNG KIDS, I THINK WHAT BREAKS

2264
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
MY HEART THE MOST IS THESE YOUNG

2265
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
KIDS CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

2266
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
HAPPENED AT THEIR SCHOOL AND THE

2267
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
BAD GUY IS GONE.

2268
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
THEY ARE GOING HOME AND THEY

2269
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
THINK THAT THE BAD GUY IS IN

2270
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
THEIR ROOM OR IN THEIR HOUSE AND

2271
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO

2272
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
CONTEXTUA

2273
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
CONTEXTUALIZE THAT AND EVEN
AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE AND

2274
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
THE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR THAT THEY

2275
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
ARE STILL NOT ALONE.

2276
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
THAT THERE'S A NATION STILL

2277
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
GRIEVING.

2278
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
THAT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S OTHER

2279
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
SURVIVORS OUT THERE WHO CAN

2280
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
RELATE, WHO LOVE THEM AND ARE

2281
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND I THINK

2282
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER.

2283
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
WE HAVE TO BE THERE IN THE LONG

2284
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
TERM WHEN THESE KIDS DO BEGIN TO

2285
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
REALIZE THE REALITY OF WHAT IS

2286
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
HAPPENING AND THAT WE CANNOT

2287
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
FORGET THIS COMMUNITY.

2288
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,000
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STAND

2289
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
BEHIND THEM, SUPPORT THEM, DO

2290
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
WHATEVER WE CAN TO LEND A HAND

2291
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET

2292
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
REAL IS WHEN YOU FEEL ISOLATED

2293
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
AND ALONE AND REALITY SINKS IN.

2294
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
>> WE HEAR YOU'RE COMING TO COME

2295
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
TO NEWTOWN.

2296
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
HOW DO YOU WANT TO HELP?

2297
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
>> I DO.

2298
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I WANT TO COME NOT BECAUSE I

2299
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
FEEL LIKE I HAVE ANYTHING THAT I

2300
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
CAN SAY THAT -- THERE'S NO

2301
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
FIVE-STEP PLAN TO WALK THROUGH

2302
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
TRAGEDY AND THROUGH TRAUMA.

2303
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I WANT TO WRAP MY ARMS AROUND

2304
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
PEOPLE, CRY WITH THEM, HEAR

2305
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
THEIR STORIES, JUST GRIEVE WITH

2306
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

2307
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
BUT WE HOPE TO COME AGAIN WHEN

2308
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
ALL OF THE CAMERAS ARE GONE AND

2309
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
THE WORLD KIND OF GOES BACK TO

2310
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
THE DAY TO DAY, WE WANT TO COME,

2311
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
WE WANT TO BRING TEDDY BEARS AND

2312
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
JUST LOVE ON THE COMMUNITY

2313
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
THERE.
JUST AS WE WERE LOVED ON AT

2314
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
COLUMBINE AND IN THE LITTLETON

2315
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
COMMUNITY.
>> AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW

2316
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
WHY, WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS

2317
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
COULD HAPPEN, WHY SOMETHING LIKE

2318
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
COLUMBINE CAN HAPPEN.
IF WE FIND OUT THAT THE

2319
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
SURVIVORS HERE, THE FAMILIES

2320
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
FIND OUT WHY, WILL THAT MAKE A

2321
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
DIFFERENCE?

2322
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
WILL THAT HELP?
DID IT HELP YOU?

2323
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT

2324
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
WE STILL KNOW WHY THE TWO

2325
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
KILLERS THAT COLUMBINE DID WHAT

2326
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
THEY DID.

2327
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I'M NOT SURE WE EVER HAVE

2328
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
ANSWERS TO SOME OF THESE
QUESTIONS.

2329
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
BECAUSE I THINK IF WE REALLY
KNEW THAT WE WOULD SEE THESE

2330
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
THINGS COME TO AN END AND,

2331
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN AS YOU SAID

2332
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
BEFORE, WOLF, THEY CONTINUE TO

2333
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
HAPPEN.

2334
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I'M NOT SURE IF -- I MEAN,

2335
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
ANSWERING A KBE ISN'T GOING TO

2336
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
BRING BACK THESE 26 AMAZING

2337
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
LIVES THAT WE'VE LOST.

2338
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
SOME IT MAY BRING SOME

2339
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
CONSOLATION, IT MAY BRING SOME

2340
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
UNDERSTANDING.

2341
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE'S 20

2342
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN WHO WERE

2343
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
TAKEN ALL TOO SOON AND SICK

2344
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
ADULTS WHO AS WELL WERE TAKEN

2345
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
ALL TOO SOON FROM THIS EARTH.

2346
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
>> CRYSTAL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

2347
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
SHARING YOUR STORY.

2348
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I'M SURE YOU WILL BE A SOURCE OF

2349
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
COMFORT FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS

2350
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
HERE AT NEWTOWN.

2351
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US.

2352
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING

2353
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
ME.
>> THANK YOU.

2354
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
>>> THERE'S A GROWING DEBATE

2355
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
OVER VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AT THE

2356
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
SAME TIME.

2357
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, WHAT YOU

2358
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR KIDS.

2359
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
THAT'S NEXT.
BEGIN.

2360
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
TOMATO,
OBVIOUSLY.

2361
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
HAHA. THERE'S MORE
THAN THAT THOUGH,

2362
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
THERE'S A KICK TO IT.
WAHLALALALALLALA!

2363
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
SMOOTH, BUT CRISP.

2364
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
IT'S KIND OF LIKE DRINKING
A FOOD THAT'S A DRINK,

2365
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
OR A DRINK THAT'S A FOOD,
WOOOOOH!

2366
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
[ Male Announcer ] TASTE IT
AND DESCRIBE THE INDESCRIBABLE.

2367
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,000
COULD'VE HAD A V8.

2368
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
>>> POLICE SAY ADAM LANZA

2369
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
BROUGHT FOUR WEAPONS, FOUR

2370
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
WEAPONS TO THE SANDY HOOK

2371
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

NEWTOWN AND NOW CALLS FOR

2373
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
CHANGES TO GUN CONTROL LAWS ARE

2374
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

2375
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
AFTER DAYS OF SILENCE, ONE VOICE

2376
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
FINALLY JOINING THE CONVERSATION

2377
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
IS THE NATIONAL RIFLE

2378
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
ASSOCIATION, BETTER KNOWN AS

2379
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
NRA.
EMILY SCHMIDT IS JOINING US WITH

2380
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
MORE OF THIS STORY.

2381
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
WHAT IS GOING ON?

2382
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
>> WOLF, THE NRA HAS SAID ALMOST

2383
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
NOTHING SINCE LAST WEEK'S

2384
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
SHOOTING.
LATE THIS AFTERNOON, THAT ALL

2385
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
CHANGED WITH THIS STATEMENT

2386
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
SAYING, OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE

2387
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
FAMILIES AND AS A MATTER OF

2388
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
COMMON DECENCY, WE HAVE GIVEN

2389
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
TIME FOR MOURNING, PRAYER, AND

2390
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
INVESTIGATION OF FACTS BEFORE

2391
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
COMMENTING.

2392
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
NOW THE NRA IS SET TO HOLD A

2393
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
NEWS CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY, ONE

2394
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
FULL WEEK AFTER THE SHOOTING.

2395
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
IT COULD BE A TEST OF THE NRA'S

2396
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
CLOUT IN A POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

2397
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
POTENTIALLY ALTERED.

2398
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
>> FROM ALL OF US HERE AT

2399
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
NRA.COM, OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO

2400
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
THE PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN,

2401
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
CONNECTICUT, AND THE FOLKS WHO

2402
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
ARE GRIEVING TONIGHT AFTER THE

2403
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
HORRENDOUS MURDERS AT SANDY HOOK

2404
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
ELEMENTARY.
>> THE STATEMENT IS A DEPARTURE

2405
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
FROM HOW THE NRA HAS HANDLED

2406
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
PREVIOUS GUN-RELATED TRANL DEES.

2407
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
UNTIL THE FACTS ARE THOROUGHLY

2408
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
KNOWN, NRA WILL NOT HAVE ANY

2409
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
COMMENT.
THAT WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE

2410
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
COMMENTS FOLLOWING OTHER

2411
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
HIGH-PROFILE SHOOTINGS.

2412
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
THE NRA IS PREPARED TO OFFER

2413
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAKE

2414
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN

2415
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
BUT HAS NOT GONE INTO DETAIL

2416
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
WHAT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS MAY

2417
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
PROVE TO BE.

2418
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
>> I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE

2419
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
A QUICK, QUICK LIVELY DEBATE

2420
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
COMING UP.

2421
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE

2422
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE NRA IS

2423
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
HOLDING THIS FRIDAY IN

2424
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
WASHINGTON.

2425
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
EMILY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

2426
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
>>> QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED

2427
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
OVER THE ROLE THAT VIOLENT VIDEO

2428
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
GAMES MIGHT HAVE PLAYED IN THIS

2429
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
TRAGEDY AS WELL.

2430
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE GUNMAN SAY

2431
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
HE ENJOYED PLAYING THOSE VIOLENT

2432
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
VIDEO GAMES, LIKE ONE CALLED

2433
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
STARCRAFT.

2434
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
IS THERE ANY LINK BETWEEN THE

2435
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
GAMES AND REAL-LIFE VIOLENCE?

2436
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
OUR SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT

2437
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
ELIZABETH COHEN IS JOINING US

2438
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
WITH MORE ON THIS.

2439
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
THIS DEBATE OVER VIOLENT VIDEO

2440
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
GAMES HAS ALSO INTENSIFIED.

2441
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
>> IT IS INTENSIFYING AND IF YOU

2442
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
LOOK AT THE LITERATURE, THERE'S

2443
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
A REAL CONFLICT OVER WHETHER OR

2444
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
NOT THESE GAMES CAN ACTUALLY

2445
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
MAKE SOMEONE VIOLENT SOME OF THE

2446
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
STUDIES SAY, NO, THEY ARE NOT.

2447
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
THEY GET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

2448
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
REALITY AND FANTASY.

2449
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
THEY GET THAT THESE ARE JUST

2450
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
GAMES BUT OTHER STUDIES SHOW

2451
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
THAT THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION.

2452
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
ONE STUDY WAS REALLY

2453
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
INTERESTING, ONE GROUP PLAYED

2454
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AND THE

2455
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
OTHER GROUP PLAYED NONVIOLENT

2456
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
VIDEO GAMES AND THEY STAGED A

2457
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
FIGHT AND THE FOLKS WHO HAD BEEN

2458
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
WATCHING THE VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES

2459
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
WERE LESS LIKELY TO HELP OUT.

2460
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
THEY WERE SLOWER TO TRY TO HELP
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FIGHTING AND

2461
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
STOP THE FIGHT AND THEIR

2462
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
CONCLUSION WAS THAT PERHAPS IN

2463
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
SOME WAY THEY HAD BEEN

2464
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
DESENSITIZED BECAUSE THEY FELT
THAT THE FIGHTING REALLY WASN'T

2465
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
THAT BAD.

2466
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
AFTER WATCHING THE GAMES, THE

2467
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
REAL-LIFE FIGHT DIDN'T SEEM THAT

2468
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
BAD.

2469
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
WOLF?
>> YOU KNOW, ELIZABETH, A LOT OF

2470
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
PARENTS ARE WATCHING THEIR --

2471
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
MAYBE THEIR KIDS PLAY A LOT OF

2472
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
THESE GAMES ALL THE TIME.
SO WHAT CAN THEY DO IF THEY

2473
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
BEGIN TO GET WORRIED ABOUT THEIR

2474
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
KIDS SPENDING AN AWFUL LOT OF
TIME WITH THESE VIOLENT GAMES?

2475
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IF PARENTS

2476
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
ARE WORRIED, THEY -- I'M GOING

2477
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
TO GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE AS AN

2478
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
EMPOWERED PARENT AND SAY, NO.

2479
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I DON'T LIKE THESE GAMES.

2480
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU CAN

2481
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
DO.
STOP PLAYING THEM F YOU FEEL

2482
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
LIKE YOUR KIDS ARE PLAYING THEM

2483
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
AND IT'S OKAY AND I WOULD URGE

2484
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
TO YOU DO THESE THREE THINGS.

2485
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
KNOW THE RATING OF THE GAME THAT

2486
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
THEY ARE PLAYING AND WATCH IT

2487
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
ONLINE.
IF YOUR CHILD IS PLAYING THIS

2488
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
GAME, WATCH IT YOURSELF.

2489
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
THEY MAY BE PLAYING IT FOR HOURS

2490
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
ON END.

2491
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
ALSO, HAVE THEM PLAY THE GAME IN

2492
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
A COMMON FAMILY SPACE.

2493
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THEIR

2494
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000

IN HER BED, LIKELY EARLY FRIDAY,

2853
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
THE AUTOPSY SHOWS.

2854
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000

MEDICATION NOT COVERED BY

02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
INSURANCE.

2862
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S WAITING

2863
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
FOR THE RESULTS OF THE

2864
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
TOXICOLOGY TESTS PERFORMED ON

2865
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
ADAM LANZA TO SEE IF HE WAS ON

2866
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
ANY MEDICATIONS OR DRUGS THAT

2867
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED

2868
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
THE DEADLY RAMPAGE.

2869
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER ALSO

2870
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
WORKING WITH INVESTIGATORS TO

2871
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
DETERMINE IF LANZA WAS CORRECTLY

2872
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
DIAGNOSED WITH ASPERGER'S OR

2873
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
WHETHER ANYONE ELSE WAS AT PLAY.

2874
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
A FAMILY FRIEND, WHO HAD WORKED

2875
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
ON THE LANZA HOME, TELLS CNN,

2876
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
NANCY LANZA HAD PUSHED HARD TO

2877
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
MAINSTREAM HER SON, MIXING HIM

2878
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
IN WITH OTHER STUDENTS,

2879
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
APPARENTLY UNSUCCESSFULLY.

2880
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
THE FRIEND SAYS WHILE HE WAS IN

2881
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
THE HOME EARLIER THIS YEAR, HE

2882
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
DID SEE ADAM LANZA, BUT LANZA

2883
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
REFUSED TO ENGAGE IN ANY SORT OF

2884
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
CONVERSATION OR EVEN MAKE EYE

2885
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
CONTACT.
IT APPEARS AS THERE'S NO RECORD

2886
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
OF ADAM LANZA FROM 2009 ON.

2887
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME HE WAS

2888
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
REGISTERED IN ANY SORT OF CLASS.

2889
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
THE LAST SIGHTING, A COUPLE OF

2890
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
MONTHS AGO, BACK AT A SHOOTING

2891
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
RANGE WHERE HIS MOM TOOK HIM,

2892
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE

2893
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
HIM ALONE.

THEY'RE REPLICATING THE SANDY

02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
DESKS THAT THE STUDENTS HAD AT

2939
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
THEY ARE MAKING.

2940
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,000
WE SPOKE WITH A FIRE MARSHAL

2941
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
WOLF, TODAY AND HE SAID MONROE

2942
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000

REST ASSURED THIS WILL BE ONE OF

2950
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
THE MOST SECURED SCHOOLS IN THE

2951
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
STATE, AT THE VERY LEAST,

2952
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE POLICE

2953
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000

2954
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000

MILES AWAY FROM HERE?

>> IT'S A SHORT DISTANCE.

2957
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
IT'S A SCHOOL THAT HAD BEEN

2958
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
CLOSED LAST YEAR, DUE TO

2959
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN THAT

2960
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000

02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000

THEY CAN EASILY FIT IN THE

2973
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS.

2974
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
AS SOON AS THE FIRE MARSHAL

ALARMS, SPRINKLERS, THAT KIND OF

2978
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
THING.

2979
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000

02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
WE WISH ALL THESE STUDENTS THE

2981
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000

2982
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
NOW LET'S SEE HOW THAT FIRST DAY

2983
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000

FRIDAY'S TRAGEDY.

3000
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
SCHOOL BUSES ROLLING ONCE AGAIN,

3001
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
AS NEWTOWN STRUGGLES TO RESUME A

3002
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
SENSE OF NORMALCY.

3003
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
BUT IT IS ANYTHING BUT NORMAL.

FUNERALS WERE HELD NEARBY.

NEED AFTER SUCH A, YOU KNOW, A

02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

3014

A LOT OF THEM DO KNOW WHAT'S

3015
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
GOING ON, AND THEY NEED

02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
SOMEWHERE TO, YOU KNOW, GET

WHY ARE YOU PICKING ME UP?

3030
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,000

02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
AND I NEED TO THANK THE TEACHERS

3032
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
AND THE STAFF FOR DOING THEIR

3033
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,000
BEST TO SHIELD MY CHILD FROM

3034
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
WHAT HAPPENED.
>> BEFORE RETURNING TO CLASS,

3035
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
SCHOOLS ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO

3036
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
TALK WITH THEIR KIDS ABOUT

3037
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
FRIDAY'S HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS,

3038
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
SAYING THE STAFF CAN'T CONTROL

3039
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
WHAT CHILDREN HEAR FROM OTHERS.

3040
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
>> WHEN A CRISIS LIKE THIS

3041
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
HAPPENS --

3042
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
>> Reporter: WENDY DAVENSON IS A

3043
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
GRIEF COUNSELOR IN NEWTOWN WHO'S

3044
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
BEEN ADVISING PARENTS ON HOW TO

3045
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
TALK TO THEIR KIDS.

3046
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
>> CHILDREN DON'T NEED DETAILS.

3047
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW IS A FACT.

3048
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
THAT A BAD THING HAPPENED,

3049
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
PEOPLE WERE KILLED, AND WE ARE

3050
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
MAKING OUR SCHOOLS VERY SAFE AND

3051
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY, VERY

3052
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
OFTEN, AND WE ARE WORKING THAT

3053
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
IT NEVER WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

3054
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
>> Reporter: AND TO PREPARE FOR

3055
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
STUDENTS RETURNING, THE DISTRICT

3056
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
MET WITH SCHOOL STAFF FROM BUS

3057
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
DRIVERS TO TEACHERS ON MONDAY.

3058
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
A CRISIS INTERVENTION EXPERT

3059
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
SPOKE TO THEM.

3060
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
AMONG THE THINGS HE CAUTIONED

3061
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
ABOUT, THE DANGERS OF GETTING

3062
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
TOO EMOTIONAL IN FRONT OF

3063
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
CHILDREN.
SOMETHING DAVENSON SAYS CAN BE

3064
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
OVERWHELMING FOR THE KIDS.

3065
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
>> THAT'S TERRIFYING FOR

3066
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
CHILDREN, BECAUSE WE ARE

3067
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
SUPPOSED TO BE THE STRENGTH FOR

3068
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
THEM.
WE PROVIDE SECURITY AND SAFETY

3069
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
AND PREDICTABILITY.

3070
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
AND IF THE TEACHERS FALL APART,

3071
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
THAT'S GOING TO SCARE THEM.

3072
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
>> Reporter: AND WOLF, AS YOU

3073
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
CAN IMAGINE, THE COUNSELORS ARE

3074
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
ON HAND FOR STUDENTS, STAFF, AND

3075
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
ALSO PARENTS.

3076
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
WOLF?
>> Reporter: MARY, THANKS VERY

3077
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
MUCH, MARY SNOW, REPORTING.

3078
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
>> THANK YOU, MARY.

3079
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
>>> STILL AHEAD, THE WHITE HOUSE

3080
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
IS GETTING SPECIFIC FOR THE

3081
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
FIRST TIME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S

3082
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

3083
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
GUN VIOLENCE.
ALSO, A LOVING TRIBUTE TO A

3084
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER WHO DIED

3085
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
DOING WHAT SHE LOVED.

3086
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
LAUREN RUSSEAU'S BOYFRIEND

3087
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
SHARES HER MEMORIES.

3088
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
>>> AFTER THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY,

3089
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
CALLS FOR CHANGES TO GUN CONTROL

3090
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
LAWS.
THEY ARE CERTAINLY GROWING

3091
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
LOUDER AND LOUDER.

3092
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
AND UNTIL JUST A FEW HOURS AGO,

3093
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION

3094
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
HAD BEEN LARGELY SILENT SINCE

3095
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
FRIDAY MORNING.

3096
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
BUT IN A STATEMENT THIS

3097
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
AFTERNOON, THE GROUP NOW SAYS

3098
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
THIS -- "OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE

3099
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
FAMILIES AND AS A MATTER OF

3100
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
COMMON DECENCY, WE HAVE GIVEN

3101
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
TIME FOR MOURNING, PRAYER, AND A

3102
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE FACTS

3103
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
BEFORE COMMENTING.

3104
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
THE NRA IS PREPARED TO OFFER

3105
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO HELP

3106
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS

3107
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
AGAIN."
THAT STATEMENT FROM THE NRA AND

3108
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
THEY SAY THEY'LL HAVE A

3109
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
FULL-SCALE NEWS CONFERENCE
FRIDAY.

3110
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
>> THE NRA WILL BE HOLDING A

3111
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
NEWS CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY, AS

3112
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
WOLF SAYS.

3113
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
AND NO DOUBT THE STAUNCHLY

3114
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
ANTI-GUN CONTROL GROUP WILL TRY

3115
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
TO MAKE ITS VOICE HEARD BY

3116
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
LAWMAKERS.
BEFORE LAST WEEK'S APPALLING

3117
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
VIOLENCE HEAR IN NEWTOWN, GUN

3118
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
CONTROL WAS ON ALMOST REALLY NO

3119
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
ONE'S AGENDA IN WASHINGTON, BUT

3120
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
THAT MIGHT BE CHANGING AT THIS

3121
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
POINT.
CNN'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT,

3122
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
BRIANNA KEILAR HAS BEEN LOOKING

3123
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
INTO THIS.

3124
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
SO BRIANNA, WE HAVE HEARD TALK

3125
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
OF GUN CONTROL MEASURES BEFORE.

3126
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME

3127
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
AROUND?
>> Reporter: THE SENSE, KATE, IS

3128
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

3129
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

3130
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
CRITICIZED NOW FOR DAYS, BECAUSE

3131
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
OF GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES FOR

3132
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
BEING TOO VAGUE ABOUT HOW HE

3133
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
WANTS TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM.

3134
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
NOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS DETAILING

3135
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

3136
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO DO.

3137
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
TODAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE

3138
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
WHITE HOUSE GOT SPECIFIC ON HOW

3139
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL TACKLE GUN

3140
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
VIOLENCE.
>> IS HE RIGHT NOW ACTIVELY

3141
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
CONSIDERING MEASURES, BE IT GUN

3142
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
LAWS OR MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES,

3143
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
RIGHT NOW?
>> WELL, HE IS ACTIVELY

3144
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
SUPPORTIVE OF, FOR EXAMPLE,

3145
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S STATED

3146
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
INTENT TO REVIVE A PIECE OF

3147
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REINSTATE

3148
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.

3149
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
>> Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE

3150
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
SAYS THE PRESIDENT WOULD ALSO

3151
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
LIKE TO CLOSE THE GUN SHOW

3152
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
LOOPHOLE, BAN HIGH-CAPACITY

3153
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
AMMUNITION CLIP, AND LOOK AT

3154
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
MEASURES THAT ADDRESS MENTAL
HEALTH.

3155
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
CRITICS HAVE CHARGED THE

3156
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
PRESIDENT WITH FAILING TO LEAD

3157
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
ON GUN VIOLENCE, EVEN AS

3158
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
REPUBLICAN SUPPORTERS OF GUN

3159
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
RIGHTS, LIKE OHIO CONGRESSMAN,

3160
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
STEVE LaTOURETTE, SAY IT'S TIME

3161
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
TO FIND A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION.

3162
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
>> I THINK MOST REPUBLICANS ARE

3163
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
WILLING TO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS

3164
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THIS

3165
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
MEANS AND THEY'RE TAKING A

3166
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
SECOND LOOK AT WHAT THE SECOND

3167
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
AMENDMENT MEANS IN THE 21st

3168
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
CENTURY.
>> Reporter: DID THE PRESIDENT

3169
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
FEEL LIKE HE WAS BEHIND ALL OF

3170
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
THIS?

3171
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
>> I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN

3172
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
THIS INTO LIKE A POLITICAL

3173
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
THEATER THING.
IT'S NOT HOW THE PRESIDENT VIEWS

3174
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
IT.

3175
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
>> BUT THE PRESIDENT IS

3176
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
APPEARING TO ACT MORE

3177
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
AGGRESSIVELY ON THE ISSUE.

3178
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
HE CALLED WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR

3179
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
JOE MANCHIN, A PRO-GUN RIGHTS

3180
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
DEMOCRAT, WHO ONCE SHOWED IN HIS

3181
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
OWN CAMPAIGN AD, SHOOTING THE

3182
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
CAP AND TRADE BILL PUSHED BY

3183
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

3184
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
>> I'LL TAKE DEAD AIM AT THE CAP

3185
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
AND TRADE BILL.

3186
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
>> Reporter: HE NOW SAYS IT'S

3187
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
TIME TO ACT ON GUN VIOLENCE.

3188
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH MEMBERS

3189
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
OF HIS CABINET MONDAY AFTERNOON.

3190
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000

SEBELIUS, AND ERIC HOLDER, A

3195
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
DEMONSTRATION OF THE

3196
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THE

3197
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,000
PRESIDENT WANTS TO TAKE IN

3198
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
COMBATTING THE PROBLEM.

3199
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
OBSERVERS OF THIS DEBATE SAY

3200
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD EXERT HIS

3201
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,000
EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY AND BYPASS

3202
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
CONGRESS TO GO IT ALONE ON

3203
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
CERTAIN THINGS LIKE BETTER

3204
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN

3205
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW

3206
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
ENFORCEMENT ON POTENTIALLY

3207
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
ILLEGAL GUN SALES.
THINGS LIKE RESTRICTING THE SALE

3208
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
OF CERTAIN MILITARY-STYLE

3209
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
WEAPONS, WOLF.

3210
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
OF COURSE, THE ASSAULT WEAPONS

3211

THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW,

3276
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
THERE'S SO MANY RESOURCES THAT

3277
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
HAVE COME TO TOWN, WHETHER IT BE

3278
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000

I MEAN, PEOPLE DO FEEL A SENSE

3282
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000

COMING FROM THEIR COMMUNITY AND

3284
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
COMING FROM THE WHOLE NATION AND

3285
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I HOPE THEY FELT A LITTLE BIT OF

3286
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN THE HOUSE

3287
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
OF REPRESENTATIVES STOPPED TO

3288
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
HONOR THE VICTIMS.

3289
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY

3290
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
LONG PROCESS.

3291
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I WAS AT THE FIRST FUNERAL OF SO

3292
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
MANY ON MONDAY, AND THE LITTLE

3293
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
TWIN SISTER OF NOAH POZNER

3294
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
HASN'T QUITE GRASPED YET THAT

3295
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
SHE HAD LOST HER BROTHER.

3296
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
AND YOU IMAGINE THAT OVER THE

3297
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, THERE

3298
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO

3299
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
FINALLY START TO REALIZE THIS

3300
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
HURT.

3301
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
EVEN WHEN THE TV CAMERAS LEAVE

3302
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
NEWTOWN, WE'RE GOING TO NEED A

3303
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
LOT OF HELP AND A LOT OF SUPPORT

3304
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO

3305
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
BE GRIEVING OVER A VERY LONG

3306
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
TIME.

3307
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
>> I KNOW YOU WERE BEING BRIEFED

3308
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

3309
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

3310
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
WHY THIS SHOOTER, THIS KILLER,

3311
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
WENT TO THE SANDY HOOK

3312
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

3313
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
>> I DON'T.

3314
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I'M LEARNING AT THE SAME TIME

3315
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS.

3316
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

3317
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
SANDY HOOK ARE ASKING THOSE

3318
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
QUESTIONS OF WHY.

3319
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED THE

3320
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
STATE POLICE, WELL, WHY ARE YOU

3321
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON THE

3322
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
MOTIVE IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WHO

3323
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
THE KILLER IS?

3324
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
YOU'RE NOT PREPARING FOR A

3325
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
TRIAL.
BUT PEOPLE WANT TO GET AS MUCH

3326
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
INFORMATION HERE AS THEY CAN.

3327
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANSWERS

3328
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
TO ALL OF THESE WHYS, BUT IF WE

3329
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
CAN GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW

3330
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
INTO THIS MOTIVE, I THINK IT

3331
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO REST A

3332
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
LITTLE BIT EASIER HAVING ALL

3333
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000

3391

3393

THEY HAD A SECURITY SYSTEM, THAT

3403
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000

3569
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,000
THEIR PARTISAN BS.

3570
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
>> JESSICA GHAWI DIED IN THE

3571
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
AURORA MOVIE THEATER SHOOTING.

3572
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
HER PARENTS SAY THEY FEEL A PAIN

3573
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
THAT IS BEYOND WORDS.

3574
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
>> JUST GOING TO HER FRIEND'S

3575
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
WEDDING AND WATCHING HER DANCE

3576
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
WITH HER FATHER, THERE'S NO WAY

3577
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
TO STOP THE TEARS.

3578
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,000
>> TO KNOW THAT WE'RE NEVER

3579
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:37,000
GOING TO HAVE THOSE SIMPLE JOYS,

3580
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,000
EVER AGAIN.
>> AND THOSE STORIES ARE SO,

3581
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
INCREDIBLY HEARTBREAKING.

3582
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
A NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVES IN

3583
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
CONGRESS HAVE ALSO SAID, YOU

3584
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
KNOW, MAYBE IT'S TIME WE TAKE A

3585
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AGAIN.

3586
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION

3587
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
HAS BEEN LYING LOW FOR THE MOST

3588
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
PART, SINCE THIS INCIDENT, BUT

3589
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
THE NRA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT

3590
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,000
WILL HAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE ON

3591
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
FRIDAY.
WOLF?
>> THANKS VERY MUCH, LISA, FOR

3592
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,000
THAT REPORT.

3593
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
TODAY, CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR

3594
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
SIGNED A PROCLAMATION DECLARING

3595
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:06,000
THIS COMING FRIDAY A DAY OF

3596
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
MOURNING IN THE STATE.
HE'S REQUESTING THAT RESIDENTS

3597
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
STATEWIDE PARTICIPANT IN A

3598
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
MOMENT OF SILENCE AT 9:30 A.M.

3599
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT

3600
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
ADAM LANZA SHOWED UP AT THE

3601
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
SCHOOL AND STARTED SHOOTING.

3602
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
TODAY, I SPOKE WITH A MAN WHO'S

3603
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
BECOME THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE

3604
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
INVESTIGATION, OF THE SANDY HOOK

3605
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

3606
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE
LIEUTENANT, PAUL VANCE.

3607
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE, IN YOUR

3608
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
39-YEAR CAREER, HOW DO YOU

3609
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
PREPARE FOR THE ENORMITY OF A

3610
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS?

3611
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
>> TRAINING.

3612
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
TRAINING.

3613
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
CONSTANT, CONSTANT TRAINING.

3614
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
THINGS YOU HOPE YOU NEVER WILL

3615
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
HAVE TO USE.

3616
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
JUST LIKE THE SIDEARM THAT I

3617
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
WEAR, YOU HOPE YOU'LL NEVER HAVE

3618
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
TO USE IT.

3619
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
YOU HAVE TO TRAIN, YOU HAVE TO

3620
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
PREPARE.

3621
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET TO A SCENE

3622
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
OR A SITUATION, EVEN A SCENE OF

3623
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
THIS MAGNITUDE, YOU HAVE TO ACT.

3624
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:00,000
AND THERE'S NO TIME.

3625
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
>> BECAUSE YOU HAVE EMERGED AS
THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN.

3626
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
YOU'RE TELLING NOT ONLY PEOPLE

3627
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
HERE, BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD,

3628
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

3629
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
IT MUST TAKE A TOLL ON YOU.

3630
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,000
>> IT DOES.

3631
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
BUT OUR TRAINING PREPARES US TO

3632
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES, TO GO

3633
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS

3634
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
DEVASTATING.
IT'S TRULY DEVASTATING, BECAUSE

3635
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
WE'RE ONLY HUMAN.

3636
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
AND WE THINK ABOUT THE FAMILIES,

3637
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
WE THINK ABOUT THESE CHILDREN,

3638
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
WE THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO

3639
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
LOST THEIR LIVES.

3640
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
WE THINK ABOUT THE TEACHERS THAT

3641
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
PROTECTED THEIR CHILDREN.

3642
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
AND ALL THOSE THINGS YOU

3643
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
PROCESS, BUT YOU HAVE TO SHOVE

3644
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
IT ASIDE AND MOVE FORWARD AND DO

3645
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
WHAT YOU'RE TRAINED TO DO.

3646
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
>> AND YOU MET WITH THESE

3647
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
FAMILIES, OF THESE 26 VICTIMS,

3648
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
20 KIDS, SIX EDUCATORS.

3649
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
THAT MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST

3650
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
DIFFICULT THINGS YOU'VE EVER

3651
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
DONE IN YOUR LIFE.

3652
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:49,000
>> I WAS PART OF IT, BUT QUITE

3653
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
FRANKLY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

3654
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
ASSIGNED TO WORK WITH THEM, THE

3655
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
ONE ON ONES, IF YOU WILL, THE

3656
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,000
INTERVIEWERS THAT HAD TO

3657
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
INTERVIEW PEOPLE, THOSE ARE

3658
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
VERY, VERY HARD JOBS, ARE VERY

3659
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
HARD THINGS TO DO.

3660
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT

3661
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:06,000
PLAYED SUCH A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS

3662
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
WHOLE SITUATION, THAT IT'S

3663
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
REALLY SPREAD OUT AMONGST MANY.

3664
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
>> WAS THERE -- I KNOW THE WHOLE

3665
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,000
THING HAS BEEN PAINFUL.

3666
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:18,000
IT'S BEEN PACINFUL FOR ALL OF U

3667
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,000
THAT HAVE BEEN HERE.

3668
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
WAS THERE ONE MOMENT THAT STANDS

3669
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
OUT IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU'LL

3670
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
NEVER FORGET THE REST OF YOUR

3671
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
LIFE?

3672
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
>> I THINK THE CRIME SCENE

3673
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

3674
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK IN ALL OF

3675
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
OUR MINDS.

3676
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
IF YOU WERE TASKED WITH THAT

3677
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
RESPONSIBILITY OF GOING INTO

3678
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,000
THAT CRIME SCENE, IT'S SOMETHING

3679
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO

3680
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
ERASE.

3681
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,000
>> YOU MEAN, WHEN YOU WALKED

3682
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
INTO THAT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

3683
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
SCHOOL AND YOU SAW THE BODIES OF

3684
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
LITTLE KIDS ON THE FLOOR?

3685
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YES.

3686
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
>> HOW DO YOU -- HOW CAN YOU

3687
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
EVEN -- THAT MUST BE SO

3688
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
SHOCKING, THAT MUST BE SO

3689
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
TRAUMATIC?

3690
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
>> IT'S AN INDELIBLE MARK.

3691
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
IT'S NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY.

3692
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
>> YOU'VE NEVER SAW ANYTHING

3693
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
LIKE THAT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE?

3694
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
>> NO.
>> I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN TO A LOT

3695
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,000
OF CRIME SCENES.

3696
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
THIS WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC?

3697
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
>> DEFINITELY.

3698
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
>> BY FAR?

3699
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
>> DEFINITELY.

3700
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
>> SO LET'S LOOK AHEAD NOW.

3701
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS

3702
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

3703
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
YOU KNOW THAT.

3704
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I KNOW THAT.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE

3705
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
CHANCES OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN?

3706
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:19,000
>> WELL, I THINK EVERYONE'S

3707
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,000
LOOKED AT THIS SCENE, THIS

3708
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:26,000
SITUATION.
WE'VE ALWAYS PREPARED, EVEN WHEN

3709
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
WE WERE YOUNGER, FOR FIRE

3710
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
DRILLS.

3711
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
WE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES

3712
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
WITHIN THE SCHOOL.

3713
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I THINK THAT'S A CONSTANT THING

3714
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,000
THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO DO IN

3715
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

3716
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
WE REVIEW, WE LOOK AT IT, WE

3717
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE HOW WE CAN

3718
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
MAKE OUR MOST PRECIOUS CHILDREN

3719
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
AS SAFE AS WE CAN MAKE THEM.

3720
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,000
WE HAVE TO, WE WORKED THROUGH

3721
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
9/11 AND WE CONTINUED AND LIFE

3722
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
WENT ON.

3723
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I DON'T WANT TO SIMPLIFY

3724
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
ANYTHING, BUT WE'VE GOT TO WORK

3725
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
THROUGH THIS.

3726
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
>> WE NEED A NATIONAL COMMISSION

3727
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
TO TAKE A LOOK AT SCHOOL SAFETY?

3728
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
>> THAT'S ABOVE ME.

3729
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
THAT'S ABOVE ME.

3730
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I KNOW THAT ON A LOCAL LEVEL,

3731
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I'M SURE OUR TOWN LEADERS, OUR

3732
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
STATE LEADERS ARE ALL GOING TO

3733
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
CONTINUOUSLY LOOK AT SCHOOL

3734
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
SAFETY TO ENSURE THAT OUR

3735
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
CHILDREN ARE SAFE.

3736
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
>> LIEUTENANT VANCE, LET ME

3737
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU AND ALL

3738
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE COUNTY

3739
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
STATE POLICE HAVE DONE.

3740
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,000
YOU'VE BEEN A SOURCE OF REAL

3741
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
STRENGTH TO ALL OF US, AS

3742
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
JOURNALISTS AND AS AMERICANS, AS

3743
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
CITIZENS, IN LEARNING WHAT'S

3744
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
GOING ON.
YOU'VE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB.

3745
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3746
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
APPRECIATE THAT.

3747
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
>> THANK YOU.

3748

FOR ALMOST A MONTH AND EXPERTS

3927
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
SAY IT COULD FALL TO LEVELS NOT

3928
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
SEEN IN TWO YEARS.

3929
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
ANALYSTS CREDIT IN PART BETTER

3930
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
FUEL ECONOMY AND MORE

3931
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
TELECOMMUTING.

3932
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
KATE AND WOLF?

3933
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,000
>> THANKS SO MUCH, LISA.

3934
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

3935
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
>>> AT CNN, WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

3936
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
ABOUT RESPECTING THE PRIVACY OF

3937
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
PEOPLE WHO LOST LOVED ONES HERE

3938
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
IN NEWTOWN AND ARE VERY, VERY

3939
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

3940
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
BUT SOME RELATIVES AND FRIENDS

3941
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
ARE EAGER TO SPEAK OUT AND TO

3942
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
TALK, TO MAKE SURE THE WORLD

3943
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
KNOWS WHO THESE VICTIMS WERE AND

3944
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,000
WHY THEY WERE SO LOVED.

3945
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
CNN'S ERIN BURNETT IS JOINING US

3946
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
NOW WITH A LITTLE PREVIEW OF

3947
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
WHAT YOU HAVE COMING UP IN THE

3948
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
NEXT HOUR.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE, ERIN?

3949
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,000
>> THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DO

3950
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,000
WANT TO TALK.

3951
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,000
AND AS YOU WELL KNOW, TALK ABOUT

3952
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND HOW IT FEELS

3953
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
AND HOW TIGHT-KNIT IT IS AND HOW

3954
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME A

3955
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
NAME THAT BECOMES SYNONYMOUS

3956
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
WITH A HORRIBLE ACT.

3957
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING WITH

3958
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
ONE DAD WHO HAS FOUR KIDS.

3959
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
A 4-YEAR-OLD, ACTUALLY, WHO'S

3960
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
ABOUT TO GO TO SANDY HOOK NEXT

3961
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
YEAR, AND HE IS DEAD SET THAT

3962
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
THAT CHILD IS GOING TO GO TO

3963
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
SANDY HOOK.

3964
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
AND IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

3965
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:02,000
HE AND HIS WIFE MOVED HERE FROM

3966
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
CALIFORNIA.
NUMBER ONE REASON, FOR THE

3967
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
SCHOOLS.
HE'S GOING TO JOIN US TO TALK

3968
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
ABOUT THAT.

3969
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
HIS OLDER SONS WAS BROTHERS WITH

3970
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
JACK PINTO'S BROTHER AND THEY

3971
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
WERE AT THAT FUNERAL YESTERDAY.

3972
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,000
THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

3973
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,000
THAT.

3974
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:13,000
VICKIE SOTO WAS A TEACHER FOR

3975
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS, SHE WAS A

3976
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
SUBSTITUTE A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN

3977
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
HIS DAUGHTER WAS THERE, BUT SO

3978
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
MEMORABLE, THAT HER DAUGHTER
STILL REMEMBERS HER.

3979
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
WE'LL BE TALKING WITH THEM, AND

3980
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
ALSO WITH THE FAMILY WHO MOVED

3981
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
HERE FROM NEWTOWN FROM

3982
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,000
AUSTRALIA.
REASON NUMBER ONE, THEY THOUGHT

3983
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
IT WAS THE SAFEST TOWN IN

3984
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
AMERICA, REASON NUMBER TWO, FOR

3985
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
SCHOOLS.

3986
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
THEIR TWO BOYS JUST WENT BACK TO

3987
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:30,000
SCHOOL TODAY AND THEIR WHOLE

3988
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,000
FAMILY WILL BE WITH US AT THE

3989
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
TOP OF THE HOUR.

3990
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
SO A SPECIAL PROGRAM COMING UP.

3991
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
>> WE'VE HEARD THIS MANY, MANY

3992
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
TIMES, JUST HOW GREAT THE SCHOOL

3993
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
SYSTEM IS HERE.

3994
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, OF

3995
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
COURSE, AFTER THIS.

3996
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
>> YOU'VE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB

3997
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
WITH THESE PERSONAL STORIES,

3998
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
ERIN.

3999
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO
THE NEXT HOUR.

4000
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU'RE

4001
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
DOING.
>> THANK YOU.

4002
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
>> THANK YOU, ERIN.

4003
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
>>> A MOTHER WHOSE DAUGHTER DIED

4004
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
IN HER FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM

4005
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
DESCRIBES MEETING PRESIDENT

4006
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
OBAMA.
WHAT SHE SHARED WITH THE

4007
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
PRESIDENT AND WHAT SHE SAYS SHE

4008
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:00,000
PRAYED FOR WITH HIM.

4009
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,000
ANDERSON COOPER SAT DOWN WITH

4010
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
HER.

4011
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,000
HE'LL JOIN US LIVE.
THAT'S NEXT.

4012
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
>>> CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

4013
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
IMAGINE THE PAIN OF SOME OF

4014
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
THESE PARENTS HERE IN NEWTOWN,

4015
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
CONNECTICUT, ARE FEELING RIGHT

4016
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:05,000
NOW.
FACING THE FACT THAT THEY MUST

4017
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
BURY THEIR 6-YEAR-OLD OR

4018
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
7-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

4019
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:09,000
OUR OWN ANDERSON COOPER IS HERE

4020
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
FOR US ON THE SCENE.

4021
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
ANDERSON, YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE

4022
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
FAMILY OF GRACE McDONNELL AND

4023
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
HAVE MORE OF THAT TOUCHING

4024
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
INTERVIEW COMING UP.

4025
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,000
SHARE SOME OF IT WITH OUR

4026
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
VIEWERS.
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, IT WAS

4027
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
LYNN AND CHRIS McDONNELL.

4028
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
THEIR DAUGHTER, GRACE, 7 YEARS

4029
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
OLD, WAS KILLED ON FRIDAY.

4030
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
THEY HAVE A SON, JACK, WHO'S 12

4031
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,000
YEARS OLD.

4032
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
AND THEY ACTUALLY CONTACTED US.

4033
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
THEY REACHED OUT TO US THE OTHER

4034
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
DAY AND ASKED US TO COME BY

4035
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
THEIR HOME AND JUST SPEND SOME

4036
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
TIME WITH THEM AND LEARN ABOUT

4037
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
GRACE AND THEY WANTED A LOT OF

4038
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR

4039
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
AMAZING GRACE.
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE

4040
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
BRINGING YOU THAT EXTENSIVE

4041
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
INTERVIEW TONIGHT ON "A.C. 360."

4042
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
BUT I WANT TO PLAY YOU JUST A

4043
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,000
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THEY SAID.

4044
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT MEETING

4045
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA THE OTHER NIGHT.

4046
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,000
AND GRACE WAS A PROLIFIC ARTIST.

4047
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
SHE WAS, FOR 7 YEARS OLD, SHE

4048
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
WAS INCREDIBLY TALENTED ARTIST.

4049
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
AND SHE DREW A PICTURE OF AN OWL

4050
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
AND THEY GAVE THAT PICTURE TO

4051
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
THE PRESIDENT.

4052
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
AND HE SAID HE WOULD CHERISH IT.

4053
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
AND THAT REALLY GAVE THEM

4054
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:07,000
COMFORT, THAT THE PRESIDENT
WOULD TAKE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT

4055
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
THEIR DAUGHTER.

4056
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
HERE'S MORE O OF WHAT THEY HAD

4057
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
TO SAY.

4058
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,000
>> IT WAS A VERY PRIVATE

4059
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,000
MEETING, BUT WHEN HE WALKED IN

4060
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,000
THE ROOM TO GREET US, IT WAS

4061
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
JUST A DAD.
HE'S JUST A DAD, COMING IN TO

4062
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:24,000
MEET A DAD AND A MOM AND A SON.

4063
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
AND WE REALLY FELT THAT.

4064
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
WE FELT HIS SUPPORT AND IT WAS

4065
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
REALLY, IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL.

4066
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
AND WE SHARED SOME SPECIAL

4067
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
THINGS ABOUT GRACE WITH HIM AND

4068
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
HER ART.

4069
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
GRACE'S DREAM WAS TO LIVE ON THE

4070
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
BEACH AND BE A PAINTER.

4071
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,000
AND SO WE OFFERED HIM ONE OF HER

4072
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000
PAINTINGS, WHICH HE SAID HE

4073
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,000
WOULD TREASURE.

4074
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
SO THAT GAVE US GREAT COMFORT,

4075
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,000
TOO.

4076
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
BUT, REALLY, JUST FELT LIKE A

4077
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,000
DAD SURROUNDING US AND FEELING

4078
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,000
OUR PAIN.

4079
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
AND YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WALKED IN

4080
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,000
THE ROOM, I REALIZED, HE HAS TO

4081
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
GO TO SO MANY FAMILIES TODAY,

4082
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

4083
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
HE'S HAD TO DO THIS.

4084
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
SO, I HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM AND

4085
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:08,000
PRAY FOR HIM FOR STRENGTH.

4086
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
>> THEY, OF COURSE, WEREN'T ABLE

4087
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
TO SEE GRACE IN THE WAKE OF THE

4088
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
ATTACK.
THEY WERE ADVISED NOT TO VIEW

4089
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
HER.
BUT WHEN THEY WENT IN TO VISIT

4090
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
WITH HER AND THE CASKET, THE

4091
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
CASKET WAS ALL WHITE, AND IT

4092
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
REALLY BROUGHT HOME TO THEM THE

4093
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
REALITY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

4094
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,000
AND THEY BROUGHT CRAYONS AND

4095
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
MAGIC MARKERS, AND LYNN AND

4096
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
CHRIS AND JACK DREW ALL OVER THE

4097
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
CASKET.

4098
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
AND THEY WANTED TO COLOR IT ALL,

4099
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT GRACE

4100
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,000
LOVED.
PEACE SIGNS AND FLIP-FLOPS, AND

4101
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,000
REMINDERS OF HAWAII AND OTHER

4102
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,000
PLACES THEY HAD VISITED.

4103
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
AND THEY SAID BY THE TIME THEY

4104
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
LEFT THE THE ENTIRE

4114
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000

4115

4116
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,000

4117

WITH EVERYONE.

4119
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,000
AND IT'S NOT ALL THAT UNUSUAL,

4120
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES PARENTS

4121
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
WHO LOSE SOMEONE IN A SITUATION

4122
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000

4125
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000

IT HELPS TO TALK, IT HELPS LYNN

4128
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,000

4129
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
TALK AND EVEN JACK, 12-YEAR-OLD

4130
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
JACK, WHO OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T

4131
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000

HIM TO TALK ABOUT GRACE.

4133

SO EVEN BEFORE WE SAT DOWN FOR

4137
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,000

4138

4139
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000

4140
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000

4141

BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL.

4148

THESE 20 KIDS WERE 6 AND 7 YEARS

4150
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000

4151

HUG THE DOG.

4297
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
AND TO SOME CHILDREN, THEY'LL

4298
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
COME UP SAD AND THEY'LL WALK

4299
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
