00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THAT KNOCK DOWN DRAGOUT FIGHT

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
STARTED AS COMEDY BUT QUICKLY IT

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TURNED VERY VERY REAL.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
MASCOTS GETTING VIOLENT.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
THE RAM AND THE PANTHER PULLING

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
EACH OTHER TO THE GROUND AND

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THROWING PUNCHES.
THE HALFTIME BRAWL DIDN'T END

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
UNTIL OTHERS STEPPED IN TO PULL

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
THE MASCOTS APART, BUT DON'T

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
WORRY.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
THE RAM AND THE PANTHER WERE NOT

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
THE FAR LEFT ON THE MARCH.

THEY ARE INSIPID.

>>> DEFINEF THE FISCAL CLIFF FOR

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000

SOME IMAGINARY CLIFF IN MY MIND

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO JUMP OFF OF.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
>> Bill: JESSE WATT IERS QUIZES

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
CAUTION.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE NO

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SPIN ZONE.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THE FACTOR BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
>>> HI.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000

THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
SECULAR FORCES ON THE MARCH.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SOME COMMITTED LEFT WING

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN EMBOLDENED

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
BY THE REELECTION OF PRESIDENT

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OBAMA.
YOU'RE SEEING THAT NOW IN THE

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AS THE

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PRESIDENT AND HIS SIDE ARE NOT

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IN ANY COMPROMISING MOOD.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I SAW IT FIRSTHAND THIS WEEK

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WHEN I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THERE IS ARROGANCE AND CON DESEN

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SHUN IN MANY LEFT WING PRECINCTS

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DESPIEGHT THDESPITE THE FACT THN

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
AMBASSADOR TODAY SUSAN RICE IS

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OUT IN CONSIDERATION FOR

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT COMING

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
UP.
THE MORE INTELLIGENT SECULAR

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
PROGRESSIVES UNDERSTAND THAT NOW

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IS THEIRSI TIME IN HISTORY.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THE AGENDA IS CLEAR.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ABOVE ALL, THE SECULAR FORCES

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WANT TO CHANGE THE ECONOMY.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THEY WANT THE GOVERNOR TO RUN IT

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AND PROVIDE CRADLE TO GRAVE

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ENTITLEMENTS FOR THOSE WHO

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
CANNOT AND WILL NOT PROVIDE FOR

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THEMSELF.
THEY WANT TO S CONTROL PROFITS,

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
AWAY FROM THE ACHIEVERS AND THE

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CORPORATIONS WITH THEHE INTENT O

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
REDISTRIBUTE THE CASH.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THAT'S AGENDA NUMBER ONE.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
NUMBER TWO IS TO OBLITERATE SOME

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AMERICAN TRADITIONS.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
GAY MARRIAGE, NOT ABOUT MATRY MW

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
KNEE ANY MORE.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
IF YOU OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE,

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
YOU'RE A HEIGHTR OR A RIGHTS

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
DENYR.
LEGALIZE NARCOTICS.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THE LEFT SEES DRUG USERS AS

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
VICTIMS AND BELIEVES NO ONE HAS

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
A RIGHT TO STAND BETWEEN AN

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AMERICAN AND INTOXICATION.

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
ON THAT NOT, THERE WAS AN

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
ARTICLE YESTERDAY IN THE "NEW

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
YORK TIMES" LANG MEANTING TOUGH

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
PRISON SENTENCES FOR DRUG

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
OFFENDERS.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THE LEFT BELIEVES THEY'RE NOT

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
VIOLENT.
IF YOU'RE SELLING METH, HEROIN,

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
COCAINE, THAT'S NOT AN ACTED

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THAT CAUSES HARM OR PAIN TO

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ANOTHER PERSON, OH, NO.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW FIRSTHAND

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ABOUT ADDICTION KNOW HOW CRAZY

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THAT POINT OF VIEW IS.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HO SELL DRUGS ARE THE

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
LOWEST RUNNING.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THEY ARE COMMITTING VIOLENCE

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AGAINST OTHER HUMAN BEINGS,

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PERIOD.

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THE TIMES ARTICLE SAYS HALF A

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON FOR

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
DRUG OFFENSES IN THE USA, TEN

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TIMES THE NUMBER THAN IN 1980.

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT SOUNDS BAD, DOESN'T IT?

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WHAT THE PAPER DOES NOT, DOES

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
NOT TELL YOU IS THAT VIOLENT

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CRIME IN AMERICA HAS BEEN CUT IN

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HALF SINCE THE TOUGH MANDATORY

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
PRISON SENTENCES WERE

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
INSTITUTED.
COUNTRIES MUCH SAFER BECAUSE

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
HARD CORE CRIMINALS ARE DOING

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
HARD TIME. THAT'S A FACT.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
KILLERS, F RAPISTS, AND DRUG

130
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
PUSHERS.
NOW, BECAUSE I DO COMMENTARY

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
LIKE THIS, LAYING OUT THE

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA, I'M A BIG

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THREAT TO THEM.

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
LISTEN TO THIS INCREDIBLE SOUND

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
BITE FROM COMMITTED LEFT WING

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
GUYNG HARRY BELAFONTE.

137
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
HE SAID PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
LIB RA AGENDA ON SOME THINGS

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SHOULD BE DEALT WITH.

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
>> WHAT FASCINATES ME IS THAT IN

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THE FACE OF MILLIONS OF

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AMERICANS EXPRESSING THEIR

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
DESIRE, THE WHOLE POLITICAL

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ESTABLISHMENT DEFINING ITS GAME

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
LINGERING INFESTATION OF REALLY

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
CORRUPT PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE WISHES

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OF THEOF PEOPLE, THE MANDATE THT

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HAS BEENTH GIVEN TO BARACK OBAM,

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE THEY

153
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WANT.
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR BARACK

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
OBAMA TO DO IS TO ORGANIZE THE

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THIRD WORLD DICTATORS AND THROW

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THESE GUYS IN JAIL FOR VIOLATING

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THE AMERICAN DESIRE.

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
>> I GUESS VIOLATING THE

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
AMERICAN DESIRE IS A FELONY NOW,

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
RIGHT, HARRY?

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MAYBE THE GUY WAS JUST KIDDING.

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
MAYBE.
BUT BELIEVE ME.

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
CHALLENGES THE SECULAR

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IS GOING TO

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
GET HAMMERED.

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THEY WANT A COUNTRY THAT

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
EMABRASIONS SOCIAEMBRACES SOCIA.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THAT BRINGS US TO THE CHRISTMAS

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
CONTROVERSY WHICH IS SYMBOLIC,

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SYMBOLIC OF THE CUL CULTURE WAR.

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO A MAGAZINE

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
CITED RETAIL STORES ALLOWING

174
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
EMPLOYEES TO NOW SAY MERRY

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CHRISTMAS TO THE SHOPPERS.

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
YEARS AGO CORPORATIONS WERE

177
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
FORBIDDEN.
THEY WERE TELLING EMPLOYEES THEY

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
COULDN'T DO THAT.

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WHILE
THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS HAS

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
LARGELY GONE OUR WAY, DON'T

181
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THINK IT'S OVER.

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
IT'S NOT.

183
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
LISTEN TO THIS EXCHANGE ABOUT

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000

"TODAY" SHOW EARLIER THIS WEEK.

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
RELIGION PART OF IT.

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I REALLY AND TRULY DO, SO I

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
CAN'T OUTSOURCE THAT PART OF IT.

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I CAN SEND YOU TO GET MY TREE,

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
>> I DON'T LIKE THE RELIGION

193
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PART.
I THINK RELIGION IS WHAT MUCKS

194
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE WHOLE THING UP.

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> Bill: SOME AMERICANS AGREE

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WITH DR. SNYDERMAN THERE, THAT

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BECAUSE CHRISTMAS

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HONORS JESUS

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WHO SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IS GOD,

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THAT IT'S MUCKED UP.

201
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
MUCKED UP, SO TO SPEAK.

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TV WRITER FRAZIER MOORE WRITES,

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
QUOTE, TURNING THE NO SPIN ZONE

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
INTO A HOLIDAY WAR ZONE.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
O'REILLY IS ALL FOR KEEPING

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS.
AT THE SAME TIME HECH PROCLAIMS

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THAT EVERYONE, NO MATTER THEIR

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FAITH, SHOULD CALL A CHRISTMAS

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
TREE A CHRISTMAS TREE AND KNOCK

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OFF THEIR WHINING.

211
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
NO INTELLIGENT PERSON COULD

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
POSSIBLY SEE AS A SECULAR

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DISPLAY OF CHRISTMAS AS AN

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IMPOSITION OF RELIGION.

215
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
HE DECLARED.

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
IT'S A PHILOSOPHY.

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
HE TOLD HIS AUDIENCE.

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
NEVER MIND THAT WEBSTER'S NEW

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WORLDAS COLLEGE DICTIONARY DEFIS

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
CHRISTIANITY A AS THE CHRISTIANS

221
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
COLLECTIVELY.
MOOR IS ONE OF THE LEGIONS OF

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MEDIA WHO HAVE FORMED A SECULAR

223
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
CLOWN TOE TOES SEE, POSSE.

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SO I'MSO GOING TO SPEAK VERY

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SLOWLY TO YOU, FRAZIER.

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
PLEASE TAKE SOME NOTES.

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
HAVE THAT DICTIONARY HANDY.

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CHRISTIANITY IS A RELIGION FOR

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THOSE WHO BELIEVE JESUS IS GOD,

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
AND FOR THOSE WHO JOIN A

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
TO CELEBRATECH

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THAT BELIEF, BUT CHRISTIANITY IS

233
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A PHILOSOPHY TO PEOPLE LIKE

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO DID NOT

235
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
BELIEVE THAT JESUS WAS THE

236
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
DEITY, AND MR. JEFFERSON AS WELL

237
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AS MANY OF THE FOUNDING FACTS

238
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
INCORPORATED THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
PHILOSOPHY INTO THE

240
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S WHY THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
HANG IN THE SUPREME COURT

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
BUILDING.
ARE YOU WITH ME SO FAR, FRAZIER?

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
IMAGES OF THE MANGERR SCENE IN

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE SIMPLY HONOR

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THE BABY JESUS, THE HUMAN BEING.

246
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE BABY IS NOT SITTING AT THE

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
RIGHT HAND OF GOD.
HE IS LAYING THERE FLANKED BY

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HIS PARENTS.

249
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
IT'S LIKE THE MARTIN LUTHER

250
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
KING, JR. HOLIDAY, FRAZIER.

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
DR. KING HONORED AS A MAN WHO

252
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HELPED ME HUMANITY.

253
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AT CHRISTMAS, JESUS IS HONORED

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
AS A MAN WHO HELPED HUMANITY.

255
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE JESUS IS

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
GOD, THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT

257
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
FURTHER AS IS YOUR

258
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.
IF YOU DON'T BUY THE RELIGIOUS

259
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ASPECT, YOU CAN JUST CELEBRATE

260
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THE FEDERAL HOLIDAY THAT WAS

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
GRANT WITH NO PROVISION,

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
FRAZIER, THAT EVERYONE WORSHIP

264
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
JESUS.

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
NOT PART OF THE DEAL.
ARE YOU STILL WITH ME?

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
OR IS THIS TOO COMPLICATED FOR

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
YOU?

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HERE'S THE BIG PICTURE.

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AGENDA

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
IS OPPOSED BY MANY PEOPLE OF

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
FAITH.F

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE,

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
LEGALIZED DRUGS, ALL OF THOSE

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THINGS ARE OPPOSED BY MANY

275
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
RELIGIOUS AMERICANS.

276
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THAT IS WHY SOME FAR LEFT FOLKS

277
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WANT TO DIMINISH JUDEO-CHRISTIAN

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
TRADITION AND RENAME THE

279
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
CHRISTMAS TREE THE HOLIDAY TREE.

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE LESS CHRISTMAS, THE BETTER.

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THESE SECULAR PEOPLE ARE NOW

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

283
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THEIR GUY'S BEEN REELECTED AND

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
OPPOSING FORCES ARE SCATTERED,

285
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
AND THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
AMERICA ON DECEMBER 13th,

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
2012.
THAT'S IT.

288
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
NEXT ON THE RUNDOWN WE'LL HAVE

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
REACTION FROM BOB BECKEL AND LAW

290
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
RA INGRAHAM.

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
A MARINE INCARCERATED IN MEXICO

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET HIM RELEASE.

295
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT.

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
AT THE T.

297
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BUT LATER...

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
[ shirt ]
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
NOT SO MUCH.
HO HO HO!

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THIS ISN'T
THAT KIND OF DEAL.

301
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY STRESS.

302
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SAVE ON GROUND SHIPPING
AT FEDEX OFFICE.

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You know how painful heartburn
can be.

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
For fast, long lasting relief,
use doctor recommended
Gaviscon®.

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Only Gaviscon® forms a
protective barrier that helps

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
block stomach acid from
splashing up-

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
relieving the pain quickly.

308
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Try fast, long lasting
Gaviscon®.

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And also to build my career.

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So I'm not about to always let
my frequent bladder urges,

311
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
or the worry my pipes
might leak get in the way

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
of my busy lifestyle.

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's why I take care,
with VESIcare.

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Once-daily VESIcare can help
control your bladder muscle

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and is proven to treat
overactive bladder

316
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
with sympts of

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
frequent urges and leaks
day and night.

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you have certain stomach or
glaucoma problems,

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
or trouble emptying
your bladder,

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
do not take VESIcare.

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
VESIcare may cause allergic
reactions that may be serious.

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you experience swelling of
the face, lips,

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
throat or tongue,

324
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
stop taking VESIcare
and get emergency help.

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Tell your doctor right away if
you have severe abdominal pain,

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
or become constipated for three
or more days.

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
VESIcare may
cause blurred vision,

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
so use caution while driving
or doing unsafe tasks.

329
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Common side effects
are dry mouth, constipation,

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and indigestion.

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've worked hard
to get to where I am...

332
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and I've got better
aces to go

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
than always
going to the bathroom.

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000

GAY MARRIAGES.

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF

378
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
AMERICANS FAVOR GAY MARRIAGE?

379
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
>> Bill: I DON'T OPPOSE GAY

380
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
MARRIAGE.
I DIDN'T SAYGE THAT.

381
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S DEFINED AS

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000

MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

389
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> Bill: YOU'RE MEANDERING HERE.

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000

>> Bill: LOOK.
IT'S NOT ABOUT A LITTLE TAX

427
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
HIKE.
IT'S ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT TAKING

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
OVER THE ECONOMY.

429
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THAT'S WHAT SECULAR PROGRESSIVES

THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SHE WAS

469
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH

550
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
CHRISTMAS.
THERE'S NO ATTACKS ON RELIGION

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

552
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
SUSAN RICE WAS TREATED UNFAIRLY.

553
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WE'RE LIVING IN A PARALLEL

554
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
UNIVERSE.

555
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
LOOK.
MOST PEOPLE REALIZE AFTER THE

556
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
ELECTION AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN

557
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
POLITICS, THE SIDE THAT WINS,

558
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
THE DEMOCRATS, FEEL VERY HEADY.

559
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THEY'RE VERY COCKY.

560
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
THEY FEEL THAT THE COUNTRY HAS

561
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
SHIFTED SO B MUCH BOTH POLITICAY

562
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
ANDRA CULTURALLY THAT THEY CAN

563
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
PUSH ALL OF THESE ISSUES.

564
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
>> Bill: AND THEY ARE.

565
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
>> THEY CAN PUSH MORE BENEFITS

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

567
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THEY CAN TAKE THE FIGHT AGAINST

568
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
RELIGION AND CHRISTMAS AND DO A

569
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
VARIETY OF THINGS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THE

570
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
END, BILL, IS IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS

571
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
OVERREACHING ON THE PART OF THE

572
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
-- OF THE COCKY PARTY, THE CON

573
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
SEATED PARTY.

574
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
IN THIS CASE, OF COURSE, IT'S

575
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
THE DEMOCRATS AND MORE LIBERAL

576
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
DEMOCRATS.
THEY OVERREACH.

577
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
AMERICA KIND OF BRISTLELES BRISD

578
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
PEOPLE INVARIABLY SAY WHOA,

579
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WHOA, WHOA.

580
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
MAYBE WE DIDN'T LIKE ROMNEY SO

581
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
MUCH, MAYBE WE WEREN'T EXCITED

582
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
ABOUT HIM, BUT WE'RE NOT THIS,

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
EITHER.
TAKE IT SLOW, LET US LIVE OUR

584
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
LIVES AND DON'T TRY TO PUSH

585
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TRADITION OUT OF ALL ASPECTS OF

586
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THE AMERICAN CULTURE.

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE AT. RISK F

588
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
DOING THATIS ONCE AGAIN.

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
>> Bill: OKAY.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I WERE A

590
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
SECULAR PROGRESSIVE.

591
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> YEAH.
>> Bill: AND I WAS ON THAT SIDE,

592
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I WOULD PUT THE PEDAL TO THE

593
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
MEDAL BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION IS

594
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
SCATTERE

595
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
D NOW.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TO

596
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
REORGANIZE.

597
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
OLD LEADERSHIP IS OUT, NEW

598
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
LEADERSHIP HAS TO COME BACK IN.

599
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
RATINGS FOR A LOT OF THE

600
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLEHE ARE DOWN,

601
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
PARTICULARLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO

602
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
BACKED ROMNEY BIG TIMEN. AND SAD

603
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
HE WAS GOING TO WOMIN THE

604
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
ELECTION, AND PEOPLE HAVE FLED.

605
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THEY'RE CONFUSED, SO IF I'M A

606
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AND YOU SAY

607
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
LOOK, HARRY BELAFONTE COMING OUT

608
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS

609
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
KIDDING OR NOT.

610
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
HE WASN'T SMILING.

611
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
>> HE'S A COMMITTED LEFTIST.

612
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
HE WASN'T JOKING.

613
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
>> Bill: WHEN HE SAYS HEY, IF

614
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE DESIRE

615
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL

616
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
RIGHT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A JAIL

617
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
CELL FOR YOU.

618
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING REALLY

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
NOW INTO A PRETTY INTERESTING

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SITUATION HERE.

621
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> THAT'S LIKE JEFFREY SAYING

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
KIND OFT PRAISING CHINA RECENTLY

623
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE SOME GOOD

624
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BUSINESS DECISIONS FOR

625
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THEMSELVES, SO THE WHOLE SYSTEM

626
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT ADMIRABLE.

627
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THEY'RE ALWAYS JOKING WHEN THEY

628
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SAY SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS.

629
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I THINK THEY'RE REVEALING IN

630
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
MANY WAYS WHAT THEY REALLY

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
THINK.

632
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
IT WASN'T TOO MANY YEARS AGO,

633
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
BILL, THAT YOU AND I WERE

634
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
TALKING ABOUTER HARRY'S COMMENTS

635
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
ABOUT CONDOLEEZA RICE AND EVEN

636
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
COLIN POWELL WHERE THEY LIVE IN

637
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THE HOUSE OFEN THE MASTER.

638
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
>> Bill: RIGHT.

639
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
>> HE WASN'T JOKING THEN.

640
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
YOU KNOW, HE MAYBE OVERSTATED A

641
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
LITTLE BIT FOR HIM.

642
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Bill: LOOK.

643
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
NOBODY CARES ABOUT HARRY ANYWAY.

644
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
>> THAT SONG IS IN MY HEAD.

645
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
YOU'RE RUINING THE CHRISTMAS

646
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SEASON, THE BANANA BOAT SONG.

647
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
>> Bill: I LIKE THAT SONG.

648
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> WOULD YOU SING IT FOR US?

649
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
>> I USED HIM NOT BECAUSE HE HAS

650
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
CREDIBILITY AND THAT HE'S

651
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO.

652
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
BUT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

653
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WHAT IS BEING SAID IN THE

654
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SALONS, AT THE HUFFINGTON POST.

655
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THERE ARESE PEOPLE GOING YOU KNW

656
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WHAT?
IF YOU OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA

657
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
NOW ANDEN YOU OPPOSE THE SECULAR

658
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA, WE'RE GOING

659
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
TO DEAL WITH YOU.

660
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
LOOK.
THE ATTACKS ON ME, I HAVE A

661
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
STACK OF NEWS CLIPS ALL OVER THE

662
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
COUNTRY BECAUSE HOW DARE

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
O'REILLY, HOW DARE HE STAND IN

664
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
OUR WAY AND POINT THESE THINGS

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
OUT?
WE'RE GOING AFTER HIM.

666
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
>> WELL, NO.

667
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
ANYONE OR ANY INSTITUTION OR ANY

668
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
MEDIA SOURCE THAT ACTUALLY

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
EXPOSES WHAT THEY REALLY THINK

670
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
OR EVEN QUESTIONS THEM, HOW

671
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
DAIRY YOU DO ADAREYOU DO THAT?

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THIS IS HATE SPEECH.

673
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
IF YOU QUESTION ANYONE FROM

674
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
KANYE WEST TO BELAFONTE OR THE

675
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
CRAZIES, YOU'RE SOMEHOW

676
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ILLEGITIMATE.
I KNOW HE WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'M NOT NECESSARILY BLAMING THEM

678
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THEY ARE.

679
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THEY DON'T LIKE, YOU KNOW,

680
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
SOCIAL. CONSERVATIVES.

681
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THEY DON'T MUCH LIKE FISCAL

682
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
CONSERVATIVES.
THEY THINK THEY'RE SCARIER,

683
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
FRANKLY, THAN AL-QAEDA.

684
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> Bill: THEY DON'T LIKE
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS

685
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
WHAT I BELIEVE.

686
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
>> RIGHT.

687
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS.

688
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
>> Bill: THAT I BELIEVE IN

689
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
MARRIAGE.

690
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THAT'S NOT A CAUSEE OF MIND.

691
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO

692
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
ERODE IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES

693
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ON IT.
IT WOFON'T ERODE THE FABRIC OF E

694
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
COUNTRY.
I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME RELIGIOUS

695
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
PEOPLE AND TRADITIONAL AMERICANS

696
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

697
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
IT'S NOT THE SAME COUNTRY. W

698
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
IT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE BUILT ON

699
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
HERE.

700
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
>> I DON'T THINK WHAT'S

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
HAPPENING NOW IS D THAT THOSE

702
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
PEOPLE ARE DEMONIZED AS HATERS,

703
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
AS  TERRIBLE PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT

704
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
LOVING OR COMPASSIONATE WHEN

705
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
THEY MIGHT HAVE A DEEPLY HELD

706
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
RELIGIOUS BELIEF OR A MORAL

707
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
BELIEF THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE

708
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
KIND OF POPULAR CULTURE.

709
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
LOOK.

710
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR BEING

711
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
VERY HEADY AND EXCITED ABOUT

712
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THEIR POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,

713
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
HAPPEN.
