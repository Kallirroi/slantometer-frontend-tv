60

I HAVE TWO KIDS.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
6-YEAR-OLD AND 10-YEAR-OLD AND

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU ALLOWING THEM TO

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
KNOW?

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
>> I ONLY FEED THEM A CERTAIN

77

AMOUNT.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I DON'T WANT THEM TO WATCH

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
EVERYTHING.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I WANT THEM TO BECOME STRONGER.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'M A SURGEON SO I DIVE RIGHT IN

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HAPPENED.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT?

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND MY SON ALEX TOLD ME THAT,

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DAD, THAT'S WHY I'M LEARNING

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
KARATE.
I'M GOING TO DEFEND MYSELF AND

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
MY TEACHER.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
MY DAUGHTER IS SAD AND SAID WHY

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IS THIS HAPPENING?

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THE DISCUSSION OF EVIL AND

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
PEOPLE SNAPPING, WHICH IS WHAT

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
WE HEAR ON THE MEDIA, DOESN'T

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
MAKE SENSE.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE EVIL, IT'S

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AND A

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
COMBINATION OF FAMILY CORE,

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WHETHER IT HAS TO DO WITH A MOM

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
TAKING HIM WITH THIS RIFLE AND

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
GUNS, IT'S A CULTUREAL ISSUE,

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
MAYBE TOO MANY VIDEO GAMES BUT

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THIS IS A FACE OF A PSYCHE.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ASPERGER'S AND AUTISM IS NOT A

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
PREREQUISITE TO VIOLENCE.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THEY'RE KIND, CARING, GOOD

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
PEOPLE IN A FAMILY THAT NURTURES

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THEM.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
AUTISM PLUS PSYCHOSIS CAN TURN

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
INTO A MONITOR.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
NOBODY WILL WAKE UP AND SAY

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
TODAY I'M GOING TO START

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000

THEY'RE AROUND US.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
AS A DOCTOR, WE NEED TO DIAGNOSE

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
THIS FIRST BEFORE THEY GET US.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I HAVE CALLED OFF ON PEOPLE THAT

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I THOUGHT LOOKED ODD.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THEY'RE USUALLY SHY.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THEY DON'T INTERACT.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THERE'S NO EYE CONTACT.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
WE KNOW THEM.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
IT'S NOT BULLY THEM.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000

BEFORE WE STARTED, THIS YOUNG

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
LOT OF US DO.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A DIVORCE, A BROTHER WHO DIDN'T

ALSO NOT TALKING TO HIM.

134

136

IN TREATMENT, IF HE WAS IN

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
TREATMENT, SOMEONE SHOULD LOOK

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
BACK AND SAID DID HE GET ENOUGH,

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WAS IT EFFECTIVE.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000

146

NOT BE RELATED TO THIS.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SOMEONE THINKS SOMETHING OUT AND

149

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN IS

188
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FORGIVENESS.
AS MANY OF US GO TO SPIRITUAL

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SERVICES TODAY, WE'LL PRAY FOR

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THOSE FAMILIES AND TRY TO FIND

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
IN OUR HEARTS ROOM FOR THE

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ASSAILANT, THE ACCUSED.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WONDER AS

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
WE MOVE FORWARD IS WE TALK ABOUT

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
WHAT WE CAN DO IN SCHOOLS TO

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
MAKE OUR KIDS SAFER AND LEARN

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
FROM A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS.

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THIS

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SUSPECT?

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
THIS ASSAILANT.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
>> WE CAN ASSUME NOT EVERYBODY

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
IS THE SAME.

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
ALL PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN MENTAL

204
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
HEALTH CONDITIONS, ASPERGER'S,

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
AUTISTIC, PERSONALITY DISORDER.

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
>> MAYBE HE WAS ON DRUGS.

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> MAYBE HE WAS ON DRUGS.

208
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THEY'LL

209
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
FIND IN THE AUTOPSY ABOUT DRUG

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
USE.
IT SOUNDS PSYCHOTIC, LIKE HE WAS

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THINKING THINGS THAT WEREN'T

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
RULE.
PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE THESE

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
PROBLEMS THAT DON'T DO SOMETHING

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
LIKE.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THIS WE DON'T WANT TO BE AFRAID

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

217
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
CONDITIONS, THIS IS AS NO,

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MA'AMICALLY -- ASTRONOMICALLY

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
SMALL.

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THE CHANCES OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
BECOMING VIOLENT IS VERY SMALL.

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE KIDS THEMSELVES, WE HAVE A

223
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
LOT OF PRECEDENT ON THIS.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF SCHOOL

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SHOOTINGS.

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO TELL

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
OUR CHILDREN IS, IF THEY ASK,

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ASKED.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HOMICIDE, ONLY LESS THAN 1%

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
OCCUR IN SCHOOLS SO THE CHANCES

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
OF THIS OCCURRING IN YOUR

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
CHILD'S SCHOOL IS VERY LOW BUT

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
OUR CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN

235
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
COMPASSION AND EMPATHY FOR THE

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
VICTIMS.

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
ALMOST 600 KIDS FILED OUT OF

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THAT SCHOOL KNOWING THEY MIGHT

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
NOT MAKE IT TO CHRISTMAS.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
TOLD TO FOLLOW AN ORDER.

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WE HAVE A FLIGHT OR FIGHT

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
RESPONSE WHERE YOU SEE HARM AND

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
FREEZE.
ANIMALS DO, WE DO.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THEN WE GET OUTPOURING OF

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HORMONES.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
>> MY HEATER IS RACE -- HEART IS

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
RACING JUST AS YOU DESCRIBE THE

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
FLEE.

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THESE ARE LITTLE CHILDREN, HOW

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
ARE THEY AFFECTED BY A SCENARIO

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
LIKE THAT?

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
>> LOOK, WHAT WE'VE -- WE'VE

254
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
SAID A LOT OF MAYBES IN THE PAST

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
AND MARK BRINGS AN IMPORTANT

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
POINT.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
WE DON'T WANT TO JUDGE PEOPLE OR

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
PROFILE PEOPLE BUT AT SOME POINT

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
WE NEED TO STOP THIS.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I THINK THE TIME WILL COME THAT

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE MAYBES HAVE TO GO TO THE

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
SIDE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
THIS.
SCHOOLS HAVE TO BECOME SAFER.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
MONDAY MORNING, THE FIRST

265
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
QUESTION WILL BE AM I GOING TO

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
BE SAFE?

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
YOU'RE NOT SURE.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
NOW, IT IS RARE BUT IT'S ALSO

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
QUITE OFTEN AND WE'RE SEEING

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THEM IN SHOPPING MALLS, IN MOVIE

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THEATERS, NOW IN OUR SCHOOL.

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME OF THE

273
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS STICK

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WITH THE KIDS AND WATCH THEM

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
CAREFULLY.

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS WILL COME.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
EVERYONE DEALS WITH IT IN A

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
DIFFERENT WAY.

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SOME KIDS MAY START TO NOT BE

280
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AFFECTED.
SOME MAY HAVE HEADACHES.

281
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
IF THERE'S A CHANGE, A STOMACH

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
PAIN, IF THEY'RE NOT EATING

283
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
WELL.
IT'S OKAY TO BREAK THE RULES AND

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
LET THEM IN THE BEDROOM AND HUG

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THEM AND KEEP THEM WITH YOU.

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
THEY NEED THE CARE AND LOVE

287
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
BECAUSE THEY NEED OUR

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
PROTECTION.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
>> OBVIOUSLY, BESIDES OUR KIDS,

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
THERE'S NO REPORT YESTERDAY THAT

291
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
LANZA RECEIVED PSYCHOLOGICAL

292
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
HELP.

293
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
WHAT DO YOU DO TO PREVENT THIS

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
>> FIRST YOU HAVE TO HOPEFULLY

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
HAVE MORE OF A REACHOUT PROGRAM

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AND GET THEM IN TREATMENT.

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY SHOOTINGS,

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THE ONE IN COLORADO, WHERE THERE

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
WERE WARNING SIGNS THAT

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
PSYCHIATRIC PERSONNEL

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
OVERLOOKED.
IN TERMS OF THE KIDS, FOR THE

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
KIDS THAT ARE SURVIVORS, PTSD IN

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
ADULTS USUALLY SEE FLASHBACKS,

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
FOR KIDS, THEY MAY WORK IT OUT

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IN PLAY.

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THEY MAY GET ANGRY, SAD, DIS

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
ASSOCIATED AND FEEL ALONE.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THESE ARE THE SURVIVORS.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
STUDIES SHOW PEOPLE IN THE

312
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
COMMUNITY HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
VICARIOUS DISTRESS.

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR THE

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SURVIVORS, AND PEOPLE IN THE
UNITED STATES.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
>> WE'LL HAVE MORE ON WHAT YOU

318
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
CAN TELL YOUR CHILDREN AND HOW

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT AND

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
PREVENT THESE HORRIBLE TRAGEDIES

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

323
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
>>> BACK NOW WITH "SUNDAY HOUSE

324
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
CALL."

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
ADAM LANZA'S BROTHER SAID'D

326
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THE STRESSES IN

328
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
HIS LIFE.

329
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
HOW DO YOU RECOGNIZE DEEP

330
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
PROBLEMS IN SOMEONE YOU LOVE?

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
WHERE DO YOU GET HELP AND CAN

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
YOU FORCE SOMEONE TO GET HELP?

333
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE'S

334
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
TROUBLED AND IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD?

335
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO?

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM.

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WE NEED TO CARE FOR THEM.

338
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE.

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I THINK THE PROBLEM HAPPENS --

340
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN MORE AS THE

341
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
STORY PANS OUT BUT THERE WAS A

342
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
DIVORCE IN 2009.

343
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SO THE LEADING FIGURE IN THE

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
FAMILY IS GONE.

345
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THE FATHER IS NOT IN THE

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
PICTURE.
THE BROTHER HASN'T TALKED TO HIM

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS.

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
THAT'S A HUGE IMPACT.

349
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MOM IS WORKING, TRYING TO RUN

350
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THE FAMILY.

351
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
YOU HAVE A LOANER, SHY -- LONER,

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
SHY KID WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL

353
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
BACKGROUND EXPOSED TO RIFLES.

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THE DEBATE ON WHETHER YOU SHOULD

355
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
HAVE GUNS IS NOT FOR TODAY.

356
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES, THEY'RE

357
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
NOT SAFE TO HAVE IN THE HANDS OF

358
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT COMPLETELY

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
INTACT MENTALLY.

360
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
PLUS THE FACT THERE'S A HUGE

361
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
PRESSURE IN SOCIETY ON THIS KID.

362
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PERHAPS THERE'S BULLYING WE

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

364
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
WHEN HE WALKED IN THE HALLWAY,

365
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
HE WOULD GO TO THE CORNER AND

366
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
HIDE.
IF YOU DIAGNOSE IT, YOU GET

367
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
HELP, WE CAN PREVENT IT.

368
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> APPARENTLY HE WAS TAKEN OUT

369
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OF SCHOOL AND HOMESCHOOLED AT

370
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
SOME POINT.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
SHOULD THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HAVE

372

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
THEY MAY HAVE.

374
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000

IS SOMEONE THAT WAS SLEEPING AT

NIGHT NOT SLEEPING.

378

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
ARE THEY DEPRESSED?

380

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
BRIEFCASE WHERE BEFORE HE

382
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CARRIED SOMETHING ELSE.

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REPORT THEM

391
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
TO THE PRINCIPALS, SO THE

392
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU REPORT

393
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
