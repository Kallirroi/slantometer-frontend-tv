>> OH!

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
OH!

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

CNN-FN BY ALLAN CHERNOFF WHO

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TRYING TO HOLD ON TO A FISH

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
WHILE STANDING IN A BOAT.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
NICE TRY, CNBC, BUT WE'RE

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
HOLDING OUT FOR MODERATE TO

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
EXTREME CURSING.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
THAT DOES IT FOR US.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
WE'LL SEE YOU IN ONE HOUR FROM

"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT" STARTS

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
NOW.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>>> TONIGHT, TEAM OBAMA TAKES A

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
BIG HIT.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
SUSAN RICE DROPS OUT OF THE

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
AFTER A BRUISING BATTLE WITH

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
CRITICS LIKE JOHN McCAIN.

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> SHE NOT ONLY GAVE WRONG

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE THE

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
PARTY LINE.

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
>> NOW IS JOHN KERRY A LOCK FOR

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
STATE?
>>> AND THE OTHER BIG LATE STORY

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
IN WASHINGTON, SPEAKER BOEHNER

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
HOW CLOSE ARE THEY NOW TO A

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
DEAL?

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
RUDOLPH GIULIANI IS HERE TO SAY

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A LOT ABOUT THESE THINGS.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'LL ASK HIM IF AMERICA IS

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
GETTING MORE DANGEROUS IN THE

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
WAKE SOME OF VERY SHOCKING

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HIGH-PROFILE GUN CRIME.

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
>>> HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
WEST MEMPHIS THREE NOW DAMIAN

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
EKLES IS ADJUSTING TO LIFE AS A

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FREE MAN.

51
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME

52
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
SHOCK AND TRAUMA.

53
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> AND HOW HE SURVIVED 18 YEARS

54
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
ON DEATH ROW.
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY NIGHTMARISH.

55
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>> THIS IS "PIERS MORGAN

56
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
TONIGHT."

57
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, YOU'RE LOOKING

58
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE

59
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HAD ONE OF

60
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THOSE WIN SOME, LOSE SOME KIND

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OF DAYS.

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN BOEHNER

63
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
MET FOR 50 MINUTES IN A MEETING

64
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
BEING CALLED FRANK.

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WHEN BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO NO

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
DEAL YET.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS WAS, QUOTE,

67
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION

68
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
REMAIN OPEN.
THE BAD NEWS, AMBASSADOR SUSAN

69
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
RICE WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SHORT LIST TO REPLACE HILLARY

71
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

72
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
>> I WITHDREW MY NAME BECAUSE I

73
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THE COUNTRY RAAND I THINK IT'S E

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
RIGHT THING FOR THE PRESIDENT.

76
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
PUTTING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER,

77
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT MAKES IT THE RIGHT THING

78
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
>> RUDOLPH GIULIANI.

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SUSAN RICE.
WERE YOU SURPRISED IN THE END

82
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THAT SHE FELL ON HER SWORD

83
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TODAY?

84
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

85
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
IN FACT I DON'T SEE THAT AS BAD

86
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

87
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I SEE THAT AS GOOD NEWS FOR THE

88
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
PRESIDENT, BECAUSE A BATTLE TO

89
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
GET HER CONFIRMED WOULD HAVE

90
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OFFERED THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

91
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
TO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE BENGHAZI

92
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THING, WHERE NO ANSWERS HAVE YET

93
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BEEN GIVEN.
>> YOU WERE ON TELEVISION WITH

94
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HER.
>> I WAS, I WAS.

95
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
>> ON THAT FATEFUL MORNING.

96
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> I WAS ON THE CANDY CROWLEY

97
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
SHOW WHEN SHE APPEARED, RIGHT

98
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HERE IN THIS BUILDING.
WATCHED IT, HAD MY LITTLE PAD IN

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
FRONT OF ME.

100
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT -- HONESTLY,

101
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT, I UTTERED AN

102
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
EXPRESSION THAT I CAN'T SAY ON

103
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TELEVISION.
IT STARTS WITH A B.

104
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
BULL --
>> YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IT?

105
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE

106
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HERE YOU HAD AN ATTACK WITH

107
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ROCKET-PROPELLED HAND GRENADES,

108
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MORTARS, VERY WELL EXECUTED,

109
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
VERY WELL PREPARED.

110
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE MORE

111
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS

112
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER

113
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
11th, I HAD JUST COME FROM A

114
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
DINNER WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

115
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SURVIVED SEPTEMBER 11th WITH ME.

116
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I SAID IS THIS WOMAN OUT OF HER

117
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
MIND?
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT, A

118
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SPONTANEOUS ATTACK?

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
DID SOMEBODY GIVE HER THAT?

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND THIS IDEA THAT SHE JUST READ

121
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE NOTES.
DON'T YOU EXERCISE SOME

122
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THIS?

123
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
>> IN AN OP-ED PIECE IN THE

124
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
"WASHINGTON POST" SHE SAYS THESE

125
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
UNCLASSIFIED POINTS SHE RECEIVED

126
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE

127
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
CLASSIFIED ASSESSMENTS I

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
RECEIVED AS A SENIOR POLICY

129
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
MAKER.

130
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT IN ANY WAY,

131
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
SHAPE OR FORM TO MISLEAD THE

132
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

133
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TO DO SO WOULD RUN COUNTER TO MY

134
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
CHARACTER AND MY LIFE OF PUBLIC

135
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SERVICE.

136
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IN RECENT WEEKS, NEW LINES OF

137
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ATTACK HAVE BEEN RAISED TO

138
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
MALIGN MY CHARACTER AND MY

139
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
CAREER.

140
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
WITH ALL THE GENERAL PETRAEUS

141
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
CONFUSION, THERE WAS AN

142
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
IMPLICATION THAT PERHAPS SHE HAD

143
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WITHHELD CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

144
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS,

145
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WHICH WAS THE BIT THAT HAD

146
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
LINKED TO POSSIBLE AL QAEDA

147
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
INVOLVEMENT.
SHE'S MAKING IT PRETTY CLEAR,

148
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THOUGH, THAT ALL THE

149
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
INTELLIGENCE SHE RECEIVED,

150
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
CLASSIFIED OR UNCLASSIFIED, WAS

151
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
CONSISTENT.

152
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO ASSUME DID

153
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
NOT SAY THIS IS LIKELY TO HAVE

154
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
BEEN AN AL QAEDA-RELATED ATTACK.

155
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
>> AND SHE DEMONSTRATED SHE'S AN

156
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
READER OF NOTES AND NOT AN

157
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ANALYZER OF EVENTS.

158
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
>> WHAT WAS HER JOB THAT DAY,

159
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
RUDY, TO BE FAIR?

160
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> COMMON SENSE.

161
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THEY GAVE HER A STORY THAT

162
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
DIDN'T MEET THE SMELL TEST.

163
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A STRONG PERSON SAYS GARBAGE,

164
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT IT.

165
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'M SORRY.

166
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I HAVE DONE THAT.

167
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

168
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
ME.

169
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT THIS

170
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WAS A SPONTANEOUS ATTACK.

171
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS

172
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO TRY TO

173
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
SAY THIS WAS A SPONTANEOUS

174
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ATTACK, TRY TO LINK IT TO THAT

175
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
MOHAMMED MOVIE THAT PRESIDENT

176
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OBAMA TRIED TO LINK IT TO FOR

177
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

178
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>> DO YOU THINK SHE LIED?

179
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT.

180
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
FOR ME SHE'S UNQUALIFIED TO BE

181
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE SHE

182
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE

183
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT TO MAKE

184
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ANALYSIS LIKE THESE TALKING

185
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
POINTS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

186
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID AFTER

187
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THE RESIGNATION CAME IN, I

188
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
DEEPLY REGRET THE UNFAIR AND

189
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
MISLEADING ATTACKS ON SUSAN RICE

190
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
IN RECENT WEEKS.
THE OTHER THING I'VE BEEN

191
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HEARING TODAY FROM MANY PEOPLE

192
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
IN WASHINGTON IS, LOOK, YES, THE

193
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BENGHAZI THING WAS PROBABLY PART

194
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
OF THIS, BUT ACTUALLY WHAT

195
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WORSENED HER CASE REALLY WAS

196
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
WHEN SHE WENT TO TRY AND HAVE IT

197
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
OUT WITH SENATORS McCAIN AND THE

198
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OTHERS AND REALLY CAME OFF

199
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SECOND BEST AGAIN.

200
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
SHE GOT LED DOWN A GARDEN PATH

201
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AND CAME OUT WITH THORNS

202
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
EVERYWHERE.

203
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING, YOU

204
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
KNOW, SHE'S JUST A BIT

205
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
INEXPERIENCED TO DEAL WITH

206
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BRUISES LIKE THIS.

207
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR HER ON

208
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THE WORLD STAGE.

209
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
IS THAT A FAIR CRITICISM?

210
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> ALSO FAIR.

211
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
WAS SHE IN ABOVE HER HEAD?

212
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
QUITE POSSIBLE.
MAYBE SHE WAS IN ABOVE HER HEAD

213
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AND NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW

214
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
TO ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE WELL

215
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ENOUGH.

216
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
NOT HAVING ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

217
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
KNOWLEDGE TO APPLY TO IT TO

218
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
REALIZE THIS IS A MISTAKE.

219
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WHEN I HEARD IT, WHEN JOHN

220
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
McCAIN HEARD IT, WE IMMEDIATELY

221
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
KNEW IT WAS A STORY THAT JUST

222
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
DIDN'T FLY.
MAYBE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE

223
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
EXPERIENCE THAN SHE DOES.
>> I INTERVIEWED JOHN McCAIN AND

224
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM THIS WEEK WHO

225
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BOTH SAID THIS.
WATCH THIS.

226
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
>> THE FACT IS SHE NOT ONLY GAVE

227
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WRONG INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE

228
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THE PARTY LINE THAT, FOR

229
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
EXAMPLE, THAT AL QAEDA IS

230
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
DECIMATED.
AL QAEDA IS NOT DECIMATED.

231
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT OUR EMBASSIES AND

232
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
CONSULATES ARE SECURE.

233
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THEY ARE NOT SECURE.

234
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
SO EVERYBODY -- WE ARE ALL

235
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE SAY.

236
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS,

237
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IF SHE IS NOMINATED, AND WE'LL

238
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SEE.
>> I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE WAS

239
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SANITIZED OR CREATED A FALSE

240
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
NARRATIVE.
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE WHERE.

241
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> WOULD YOU OBJECT TO HER

242
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE

243
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
PERSONALLY?
>> PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE

244
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SHE WOULD SERVE THE COUNTRY WELL

245
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IN THAT CAPACITY.
>> WE'RE WILLING TO GIVE HER THE

246
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
NOMINATION PROCESS, BUT SHE'S

247
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
GOT A LOT TO PROVE.

248
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> I MEAN CRITICS ARE SAYING,

249
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
LOOK, SHE'S BASICALLY BEEN

250
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
STITCHED UP HERE BY A LOT OF

251
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
OLDER GUYS IN THE REPUBLICAN

252
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
PARTY WHO HAVE LOOKED AT A

253
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN AND THOUGHT

254
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF

255
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
HERE.
>> A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULDN'T

256
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
HAVE MADE THAT STATEMENT.

257
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULD HAVE

258
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HAD ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

259
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
KNOWLEDGE, ENOUGH INDEPENDENT
JUDGMENT TO REALIZE SHE WAS

260
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
BEING FED A LOAD OF MULARKEY.

261
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
IN THE WORDS OF OUR VICE

262
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
PRESIDENT.
>> SHE'S CLEARLY BRIGHT, RUDY.

263
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SHE'S NOT A STUPID WOMAN.

264
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SHE'S A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

265
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT WITH ENOUGH

266
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
INFORMATION, NOT WITH ENOUGH

267
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
EXPERIENCE TO KNOW HOW TO

268
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CRITICALLY ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE.

269
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> IF JOHN KERRY GETS THE JOB --

270
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD, FIRST OF

271
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ALL?

272
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?

273
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> WOULD TI SUPPORT IT?

274
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED JOHN

275
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
KERRY, I SEE NO REASON TO STAND

276
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IN THE WAY OF JOHN KERRY AS

277
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

278
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'M CERTAINLY IF I WERE

279
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PRESIDENT NEVER SELECT JOHN

280
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
KERRY AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

281
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> WHY?
>> I THINK SOME PEOPLE IN OUR

282
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
MILITARY WILL HAVE A VERY HARD

283
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
TIME.
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE

284
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
HANOI HILTON LISTENING TO JOHN

285
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
KERRY ATTACKING AMERICA AND

286
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ATTACKING AMERICAN SOLDIERS WILL
HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS.

287
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA,

288
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
WHO WOULD YOU GO FOR?

289
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M NOT

290
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

291
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
ARE YOU SAYING TO ME IS THIS AN

292
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ACCEPTABLE CHOICE WITHIN THE

293
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
REALM OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIGHT

294
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
TO CHOOSE?

295
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
WHICH I BELIEVE IN VERY MUCH.

296
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
YES, THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE

297
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
CHOICE.

298
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO THE FISCAL

299
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
CLIFF, BECAUSE IT'S BECOME A

300
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
REAL PAIN IN THE BACK SIDE FOR

301
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
EVERYBODY REALLY AND EVERYBODY

302
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IS WAITING FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE

303
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TO BE AN INEVITABLE DEAL.

304
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IT WOULD SEEM TODAY THAT JOHN

305
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
BOEHNER AND PRESIDENT OBAMA MET

306
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

307
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.

308
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THEY HAVEN'T COME OUT ATTACKING

309
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EACH OTHER, THAT'S ENCOURAGING.

310
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS AS A

311
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
PRE-CHRISTMAS DONE DEAL, RUDY?

312
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> I THINK SO, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

313
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

314
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IT.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE COMMENT THAT

315
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THEY HAD A FRANK TALK.

316
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE COLD WAR.

317
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THAT'S WHEN KRUSCHEV AND KENNEDY

318
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
WOULD MEET AND THE NEXT THING

319
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
AFTER YOU SAID THEY HAD A FRANK

320
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
CONVERSATION, EVERYONE WENT INTO

321
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
SHELTERS AND SAID OH, MY GOD,

322
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?

323
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
TO ME A DEAL IS DOABLE, BUT

324
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
YOU'VE GOT -- YOU HAVE TO

325
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
RECOGNIZE WHAT BOTH SIDES --

326
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS A

327
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HIKE IN TAXES.

328
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

329
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ISN'T IT?

330
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
LET'S BE HONEST, THE REPUBLICANS

331
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
HAVE LOST THAT ARGUMENT.

332
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE ARGUMENT NOW CLEARLY IS

333
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
ABOUT HOW FAR ARE THE SPENDING

334
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
CUTS GOING TO GO.

335
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
>> NOT ONLY HOW FAR, ARE THEY

336
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

337
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
REPUBLICANS DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL

338
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
DO SPENDING CUTS.

339
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
SO HERE'S MY PROPOSAL, SEE WHAT

340
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
IT'S WORTH.

341
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE, SPLIT THE

342
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
DIFFERENCE.

343
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE TO JUMP THE

344
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
RATE FROM 35 TO 37 AND OTHER

345
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
SIMILAR KINDS OF JUMPS.

346
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
DEMOCRATS AGREE TO A TRILLION

347
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
DOLLARS, TRILLION AND A HALF

348
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS.

349
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THE SPENDING CUTS AND THE TAX

350
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
INCREASES GO INTO EFFECT AT THE

351
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SAME TIME.
BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT REPUBLICANS

352
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.

353
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WE'LL GIVE

354
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THEM THE TAX INCREASES, THEY'LL

355
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SAY, DON'T WORRY, AND THEN A

356
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
YEAR FROM NOW THEY'LL BE VERY,

357
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
VERY FEW SPENDING DECREASES.

358
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
SO IF YOU COULD LINK THE TWO

359
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THINGS TOGETHER AND SAY, OKAY,

360
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WE CAN'T GET ALL THE SPENDING

361
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
REDUCTIONS DONE RIGHT NOW.

362
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WE'LL AGREE ON A TAX INCREASE OF

363
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

364
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WE'LL AGREE ON SPENDING

365
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
DECREASES FOR REAL.

366
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THEY GO INTO EFFECT JUNE 30th.

367
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
JUNE 30th BOTH THINGS HAPPEN.

368
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I DON'T SEE REPUBLICANS AGREEING

369
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
TO A TAX INCREASE WITHOUT

370
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
GETTING THEIR SPENDING CUTS KIND

371
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OF LOCKED IN STONE.

372
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY VERY

373
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SENSIBLE AND I THINK THE REAL

374
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
BATTLE WILL COME WITH THE DEBT

375
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
CEILING GETS KICKED INTO THE

376
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
ORBIT OF WASHINGTON COME

377
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
JANUARY, FEBRUARY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REALLY

378
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
TASTY DEBATE, I SUSPECT.

379
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT UPPED THE

380
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ANTE BY SAYING HE WANTED SORT OF

381
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
PERMANENT AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE

382
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DEBT CEILING AND THAT'S REALLY A

383
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
NONSTARTER.

384
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THAT MIGHT EVEN BE

385
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I'M NOT SURE.

386
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO GUNS BRIEFLY.

387
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THE REASON I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

388
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
ABOUT IT, WE HAD ANOTHER OUTRAGE

389
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THIS WEEK, A YOUNG MAN ARMED

390
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
WITH AN AR-15 ASSAULT WEAPON

391
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
GOES INTO A SHOPPING MALL AND

392
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
STARTS SHOOTING PEOPLE.

393
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THANK GOD HIS WEAPON JAMMED AND

394
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
HE WASN'T ABLE TO COMMIT THE

395
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ATROCITY WE SAW IN AURORA, BUT

396
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
IT WAS THE SAME WEAPON THAT THE

397
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
GUY IN AURORA USED, ONE OF THE

398
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
FOUR THAT HE HAD WAS AN AR-15.

399
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THEY ARE BANNED IN NEW YORK.

400
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
YOU CAN'T GET THEM HERE.

401
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IT'S ILLEGAL.

402
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
WELL, THEY'RE NOT BANNED IN MOST

403
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
STATES IN AMERICA.

404
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ALMOST EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO,

405
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WHO ISN'T RABIDLY PRO-GUN THINKS

406
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THERE SHOULD BE A SENSIBLE

407
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
DEBATE ABOUT BANNING THOSE KINDS

408
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
OF WEAPONS AGAIN.

409
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?

410
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> I AGREE THERE SHOULD BE A

411
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
SENSIBLE DEBATE ABOUT IT.

412
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I DIDN'T AGREE THAT IT

413
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
NECESSARILY SHOULD RESULT IN

414
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
IMMEDIATE GUN CONTROL BECAUSE I

415
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
LOOK AT THE MURDER THAT TOOK

416
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PLACE IN NORWAY OR IN FINLAND

417
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WHERE, WHAT, 79 PEOPLE WERE

418
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
KILLED WITHOUT A GUN.

419
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SO THE REALITY -- THE REALITY IS

420
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SENSIBLE

421
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
DEBATE ABOUT WEAPONS LIKE THIS,

422
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN

423
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
WE PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS ON

424
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
THEM, HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE

425
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THEY'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE

426
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
RIGHT PEOPLE.

427
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
BUT PLEASE DON'T USE IT AS A WAY

428
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
OF NOT DEALING WITH WHAT'S

429
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
REALLY GOING ON, WHICH THESE

430
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

431
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I THINK A LOT OF ANY INCREASE WE

432
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
SEE IN CRIME DOESN'T COME FROM

433
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
GUNS, IT COMES FROM A LACK OF

434
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
RESPONSIBILITY IN SOCIETY.

435
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> I KEEP HEARING IT'S NOT THE

436
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
GUNS, IT'S ITS PEOPLE.

437
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THAT'S FINE, BUT THIS CHARACTER,

438
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
22 YEARS OLD, SEEMED PERFECTLY

439
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
NORMAL TO EVERYBODY WHO KNEW

440
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
HIM.

441
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
FAMILY, FRIENDS, SCHOOL

442
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
COLLEAGUES, WHATEVER.

443
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
EVERYONE WHO HAD EVER KNOWN THIS

444
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
GUY SAID MR. NORMAL.

445
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
NOT A CLUE THAT HE WOULD EVER DO

446
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THIS, AND YET HE GOES INTO A

447
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SHOPPING MALL AND BEGINS

448
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SHOOTING PEOPLE IN WHAT WAS A

449
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
VERY SIMILAR IN, MY VIEW, KIND

450
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
OF THING THAT WE SAW IN AURORA.

451
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
MAYBE A COPY CAT, CRY FOR

452
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ATTENTION, WHATEVER IT IS.

453
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE FOR THAT.

454
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO REMOVE

455
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THAT GUY'S ABILITY TO FIND AN

456
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AR-15.

457
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OR STEAL ONE, AS HE DID.

458
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
>> AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

459
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
REMOVE IT, THOUGH.

460
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
>> WHY NOT?
>> IF HE DOESN'T GET THE AR-15,

461
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
HE'LL GO GET A HANDGUN.

462
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
IF HE DOESN'T DO THAT, HE'LL GO

463
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
GET EXPLOSIVES.

464
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT, HE'LL GO

465
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
GET POISON.

466
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
>> BUT DON'T YOU HAVE TO TRY

467
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A COUNTRY

468
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
WITH SO MANY GUNS TO TRY TO MAKE

469
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
IT HARDER?

470
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
>> I THINK I PROBABLY WITH BILL

471
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
BRATTEN SEIZED MORE GUNS IN NEW

472
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
YORK CITY THAN ANY MAYOR IN

473
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
HISTORY.
MAYBE MIKE AND COMMISSIONER

474
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
KELLY HAVE MET THAT RECORD, I'M

475
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
NOT SURE.
BUT I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO

476
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
REALLY SEIZE GUNS.

477
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I BELIEVE IN IT.
I BELIEVE IN GETTING THEM OUT OF

478
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
SOCIETY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT

479
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ENDS CRIME.

480
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS MUCH MORE

481
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
IMPORTANT.
IF YOU WANT TO DO A FACTOR, 75%

482
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
IS HUMAN BEHAVIOR, 25% IS THE

483
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
INSTRUMENT.

484
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
WEAPONS LIKE THIS WHERE PEOPLE

485
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
CAN KILL, YOU KNOW, MULTIPLE

486
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
TIMES VERY, VERY QUICKLY, WE

487
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
SHOULD HAVE SOME REASONABLE

488
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THEM.

489
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
>> THAT IS WHERE I THINK THIS

490
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
STRAYS AWAY FROM THE RIGHT TO

491
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
BEAR ARMS.

492
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IT SHOULDN'T INCLUDE THOSE KIND

493
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OF WEAPONS WITH THOSE KIND OF

494
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
MAGAZINES.

495
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, IT ALSO
LEADS TO PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE

496
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
TO ARM THEMSELVES WITH HANDGUNS.

497
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ARM

498
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THEMSELVES WITH HANDGUNS BECAUSE

499
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT, IF

500
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THEY JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE,

501
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND THIS IDIOT HAS AN AK-47,

502
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THEY CAN KILL HIM.
>> RUDY, ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK TO

503
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING

504
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

>> MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU TOO.

507
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000

508
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
YOU'RE THE FIRST TO WISH ME A

509
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
WHEN WE COME BACK I'LL THROW

ABOUT ALL YOUR MEDICAL
CONDITIONS AND MEDICATIONS,

541
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000

ENOUGH FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

542
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

543
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000

SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

549
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

550
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS IN HEARING OR VISION,

551
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
OR IF YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIC
REACTIONS SUCH AS RASH, HIVES,

552
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
SWELLING OF THE LIPS,
TONGUE OR THROAT,

553
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING
OR SWALLOWING,

554
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
STOP TAKING CIALIS AND GET
MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

555
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE

556
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
AND A 30-TABLET FREE TRIAL.

557
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A Hybrid? Most are
just no fun to drive.

558
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Now, here's one that will
make you feel alive.

559
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Meet the five-passenger
Ford C-MAX Hybrid.

560
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
C-MAX says ha.

561
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
C-MAX says wheeee.

562
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Which is what you get,
don't you see?

563
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Cause C-MAX has lots more
horsepower than Prius v,

564
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
a hybrid that C-MAX
also bests in MPG.

565
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Say hi to the all-new 47
combined MPG C-MAX Hybrid.

566
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>>> TODAY I MADE THE DECISION

567
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THAT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR

568
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
OUR COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN

569
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
PEOPLE THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO BE

570
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
CONSIDERED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

571
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
NOMINATION AS SECRETARY OF STATE

572
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

573
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

574
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

575
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
POLITICIZED.

576
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
>> AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TELLING

577
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
NBC'S BRIAN WILLIAMS ON ROCK

578
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
CENTER WHY SHE WAS WITHDRAWING

579
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
HER NAME FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.

580
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
LET'S GET TO THE BATTLE IN

581
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
AMERICA.

582
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

583
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.

584
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
>> LET ME START WITH YOU,

585
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
MARGARET HOOVER.
THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A BIG WIN

586
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
FOR THE OLD GUARD REPUBLICANS.

587
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I INTERVIEWED THE THREE AMIGOS

588
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES THIS

589
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
WEEK, BUT I'M SURE SENATORS

590
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
McCAIN AND GRAHAM WILL SLEEP

591
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
EASY TONIGHT KNOWING THEY'VE

592
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
SEEN OFF THE CHALLENGE FROM

593
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
SUSAN RICE.

594
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE PLEASED

595
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
ABOUT THIS?
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR THEM IF IT'S

596
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
AS MUCH PERSONALLY ABOUT HER OR

597
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
IF IT'S ABOUT BENGHAZI.

598
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
ALL THREE OF THEM DID

599
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
IMMEDIATELY TODAY MAKE

600
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
STATEMENTS SAYING WE WILL NOT

601
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
STOP THE SCRUTINY ON BENGHAZI

602
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
AND WHAT HER WITHDRAWAL DOES IS

603
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
STOP THE SCRUTINY OR THE

604
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
HEADLINES OF BENGHAZI.

605
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
>> THERE'S A FEAR THAT SHE'S

606
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
BASICALLY FALLEN ON HER SWORD

607
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

608
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
BE A RESIGNATION LINKED TO

609
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
BENGHAZI AT SOME STAGE.

610
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
>> IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE HER.

611
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
BUT REMEMBER THE FOUNDATION

612
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
REALLY STARTED TO CRUMBLE ON

613
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THIS WHEN THE LEFT STOPPED

614
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SUPPORTING SUSAN RICE.

615
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
SO AS MUCH AS THE THREE AMIGOS

616
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
WERE OUT IN FRONT, MAUREEN DOWD

617
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
HAD CRITICAL, CRITICAL REVIEWS

618
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OF HER, EZRA KLEIN, THE

619
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
ENVIRONMENTALIST MOVEMENT

620
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH
HER.

621
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
>> THAT IS TRUE AND I DETECTED

622
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THAT.
THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE WHEN SHE

623
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WENT UP THERE TO SEE THE THREE

624
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
AMIGOS AND OTHERS, SHE REALLY

625
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
EMERGED LOOKING QUITE WEAKENED

626
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
AS IF SHE GOT INTO AN OBVIOUS

627
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
TRAP AND BEEN LASSOED ALL OVER

628
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
AGAIN.
IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK VERY SMART

629
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
POLITICS BY HER.

630
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
>> WELL, NO, I THINK SHE TOOK

631
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ONE FOR THE TEAM.

632
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ENTIRE

633
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
SITUATION HAS BECOME HIGHLY

634
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
POLITICIZED.

635
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
FRANKLY GIULIANI SAYING SHE MAY

636
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
NOT HAVE BEEN SHARP ENOUGH IS

637
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
WHOLLY UNFAIR AND I THINK IT

638
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
REALLY IS A TRAGEDY, BECAUSE SHE

639
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
REALLY, I WOULD SAY, IS THE BEST

640
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WOMAN FOR THE JOB.

641
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
SHE WAS A TRUSTED ADVISER TO THE

642
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
PRESIDENT AND SHE HAS DONE MORE

643
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
IN TERMS OF PUTTING SANCTIONS

644
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
AGAINST IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN HER

645
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
CAPACITY AS AMBASSADOR.

646
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
IS TRULY A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS

647
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
21st CENTURY DIPLOMACY AND

648
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
NATIONAL SECURITY.

649
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
AND WHAT SHE DID WAS GO AND READ

650
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
TALKING POINTS GIVEN TO HER BY

651
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THE NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF AND

652
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
DID HER JOB.

653
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
HAD SHE GONE IN AND ASSERTED HER

654
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
OWN OPINIONS, HER OWN -- IT

655
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS PLAYING

656
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
POLITICS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

657
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
OUT OF PLACE.
>> OKAY.

658
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
BUT MARGARET, WHETHER SHE'S THE

659
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB I THINK

660
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
IS A FAIRLY ARGUABLE POINT.

661
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I DON'T THINK SHE'S BEEN

662
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
MASSIVELY IMPRESSIVE IN THE LAST

663
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
FEW MONTHS.

664
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC

665
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
DELIBERATELY BUT NOT MASSIVELY

666
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
IMPRESSIVE.
JOHN KERRY, I WOULD SAY, IS

667
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
PROBABLY A BETTER CANDIDATE,

668
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
JUST FROM MY DISPASSIONATE EYE.

669
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
>> HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE

670
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
MADE THE SAME MISTAKE SHE MADE.

671
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I THINK SENATOR CLINTON PROBABLY

672
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SAID IT BEST WHEN SHE ACTUALLY

673
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
MADE EVERY INDICATION THAT SHE

674
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
FAVORS JOHN KERRY FOR THE

675
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
POSITION, NOT SECRETARY RICE.

676
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
HE IS WIDELY RESPECTED IN

677
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WASHINGTON, WHETHER YOU LIKE

678
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
HIS -- HE'S BEEN HEAD OF THE

679
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR

680
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS SO HE

681
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
PROBABLY DOES HAVE MORE

682
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
EXPERIENCE.
NOT TO KNOCK SUSAN RICE'S

683
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY.

684
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SENATOR

685
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
McCAIN WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE

686
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
FOREIGN POLICY THAT JOHN KERRY

687
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
RUNS ANY BETTER THAN SUSAN RICE.

688
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
IT WAS THE HANDLING OF THIS AND

689
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
THE HANDLING OF THE

690
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ADMINISTRATION WITH BENGHAZI

691
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
THAT THIS BECAME THE SYMBOL OF.

692
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO THIS RATHER

693
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DIFFICULT SITUATION THE

694
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
PRESIDENT FINDS HIMSELF IN WITH

695
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THE TOP FOUR CABINET POSITIONS

696
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
COULD ALL BE FILLED BY MEN IT

697
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
NOW SEEMS, NO WOMEN AT ALL.

698
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
THAT'S NOT GREAT FOR A

699
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT LIKE

700
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
BARACK OBAMA, IS IT?
>> YEAH, NO.

701
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD

702
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT

703
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
PROSPECT.
I THINK THE THING IS THERE IS I

704
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
DEEP ENOUGH BENCH OF FABULOUS

705
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
WOMEN THAT COULD FULFILL THESE

706
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ROLES AND WE SURE WOULD LIKE TO

707
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
SEE THEM HOLD THOSE POSITIONS.

708
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
SUSAN RICE, I THINK IS NOT JUST

709
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THE BEST WOMAN FOR THE JOB, I

710
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
THOUGHT SHE WAS THE BEST PERSON

711
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
FOR THE JOB.
IN TERMS OF JOHN KERRY BEING A

712
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
SAFE CHOICE, HE'S VANILLA AND

713
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
VANILLA IS ALWAYS A SAFE FLAVOR,

714
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
RIGHT?

715
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
BUT I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY IT'S

716
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IN

717
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
TERMS OF I THINK IT'S GOOD TO

718
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE

719
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
JOB ALWAYS.

720
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH CHECKING

721
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
OUT THE PROSPECTS FOR SURE.

722
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
>>> LET'S TURN TO THE FISCAL

723
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
CLIFF, THE FRANK MEETING BETWEEN

724
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOHN

725
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BOEHNER.

726
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I BELIEVE THEY JUST CALLED EACH

727
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
OTHER NAMES FOR 50 MINUTES AND

728
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
WALKED OUT WITH NO DEAL BEING

729
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
DONE.

730

UKRAINE PARLIAMENT.

732
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
JUST WHEN YOU THINK WASHINGTON

733
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000

734
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
DOING THINGS TOGETHER, LOOK AT

THESE CLOWNS, THIS IS QUITE

736
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
AMAZING.
THIS IS THE UKRAINE PARLIAMENT

737
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
ERUPTING INTO OPEN PHYSICAL

738
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000

739
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
NOW, THERE IS A VOORIEW THAT A D

740
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
OLD PUNCH-UP DOES TEND TO

741
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
RESOLVE THESE THINGS.

742
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
MAYBE JOHN BOEHNER AND BARACK

743
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
OBAMA SHOULD JUST SQUARE OFF,

744
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
GET IN A RING AND SLUG EACH

745
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000

THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THE

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
UKRAINE.
>> OR THE BRITISH PAURLIAMENTPA.

749
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
IT'S FAR MORE INTERESTING AND

750
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
FAR MORE FUN WHEN YOU CAN THROW

751
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
A LITTLE HUMOR AND PUNCHES.

752
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
MAYBE THEY NEED TO GET IT OUT OF

753
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
THEIR SYSTEMS.

754
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
>> BUT BRITISH YOU HAVE

755

THOUGH, MARGARET HOOVER, LET ME

758
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ASK MARGARET FIRST AND THEN YOU

759
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
MARJORIE, ARE WE GOING TO GET A

760
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000

ALL THE HINTS I'M GETTING IS

762
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
YES, IT'S GOING TO BE A DEAL.

763
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A

764
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
DEAL AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS

765
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
HOW HEAVILY SCORNED IS JOHN

766
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
BOEHNER AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT

767
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
HURT BARACK OBAMA'S MOMENTUM

768
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
GOING INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE

769
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
NEXT DEAL BECAUSE HE WANTS TO

770
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
GET IMMIGRATION DONE IN JANUARY

771
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AND FEBRUARY.
IF HE'S GOT AN IMPENDING DEBT

772
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
CEILING DEBATE HE'S GOING TO

773
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH INSTEAD THAT,

774
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
WILL PUT REAL MOMENTUM INTO IT.

775
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
SO WHAT IS HE GOING TO GIVE

776
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BOEHNER --
>> IF OBAMA WINS THE VICTORY

777
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OVER RAISING INCOME TAX FOR THE

778
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
WEALTHY 2%, HE WILL SEE THAT AS

779
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
A MAJOR TRIUMPH.

780
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
IT WAS AN ELECTION PLEDGE.

781
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
HE WILL THINK, OKAY, ONE FOR THE

782
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
NEW GIPPER.

783
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
BUT HE'S GOT TO GIVE JOHN

784
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
BOEHNER SOMETHING ELSE.
HE'S GOT TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING

785
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
HE CAN TAKE BACK TO HIS FAITHFUL

786
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
AND SAY I'VE GOT SOMETHING TOO.

787
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> I'M GOING TO START USING

788

789
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
YES, I THINK HE WILL GET HIS BIT

790
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THERE, BUT I THINK HE WILL HAVE

791
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
TO GIVE, ABSOLUTELY.

792
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPROMISE IN

793
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THE END.

794
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
HONESTLY, THIS IS CLASSIC

795
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
NEGOTIATION 101.
THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE

796
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000

797
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
TO THEIR SIDE, HEY, LOOK, WE

WE GOT OUR PIECE.

801
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

802
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
YOU LOOK AT ANY OF THE PAST

803
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES, IT ALWAYS

804

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
TINY BITS OF TRIVIAL DETAIL

909
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM

910
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

911
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
THERE'S A GREAT STORY THAT YOU

912
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
TELL ABOUT YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER

913
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
IF YOU COULD HAVE A CAR.

914
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
AND IN EXCHANGE HE SAID, RIGHT,

915
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
YOU CAN.
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY BIRTHDAY

916
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
OR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR SOME

917
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
INDETERMINANT PERIOD.

918
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
HOW LONG WAS THE PERIOD?

919
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
>> THREE YEARS.

920
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GIVE

921
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
ME $5,000 AND I THOUGHT I COULD

922
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
GET THE CAR FOR $5,000 AND I WAS

923
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
$2500 SHORT.
THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY.

924
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
>> HOW DID YOU FEEL?

925
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
DIDDY EVER NEARLY SUCCUMB TO THE

926
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
PRESSURE?
>> OH, NO, IT WAS A DEAL.

927
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD A DEAL IS A

928
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
DEAL.
>> WAS THERE A HANDSHAKE OR

929
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
FORMAL CONTRACT?

930
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
>> NO, THE HANDSHAKE WAS IT.

931
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
>> HAS YOUR DAD ALWAYS BEEN A

932
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
HANDSHAKE MAN?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

933
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
HE'S MADE SOME OF THE BIGGEST

934
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
DEALS ANY BUSINESSMAN HAS EVER

935
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
MADE ON A HANDSHAKE.

936
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
>> AND YOU THE SAME?

937
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

938
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I MEAN IF YOU DON'T TRUST WHO

939
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
YOU'RE DOING A DEAL WITH, THEN

940
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING A DEAL.

941
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
A CONTRACT DOESN'T MAKE A BAD

942
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
GUY DO A GOOD DEAL.

943
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT ON A

944
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HANDSHAKE.
>> THE OTHER STORY I ABSOLUTELY

945
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
LOVED WAS AS A KID YOU TURNED

946
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
YOUR BACK YARD INTO A FARM AND

947
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
THAT'S BECOME YOUR GREAT PASSION

948
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
OR LOVE.

949
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
YOUR FATHER LATER BOUGHT LAND

950
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
FOR YOU AND CHARGED YOU RENT,

951
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
BUT THIS WAS THE TWIST.
HE TIED IT TO THE AMOUNT OF YOUR

952
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
BODY WEIGHT.

953
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THE HIGHER YOUR WEIGHT, THE

954
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
HIGHER THE RENT.

955
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
DID IT WORK?

956
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST DIET

957
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THING IN HISTORY.

958
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
>> IT DIDN'T WORK.

959
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
AND HE WOULD TELL YOU IT DIDN'T

960
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WORK.

961
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
YOU KNOW, SO WE MOVED ON TO THE

962
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
NEXT THING.

963
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
>> WHAT DID WORK OVER THE YEARS?

964
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> WELL, I THINK THE THINGS THAT

965
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
HAVE WORKED, I'M NOT SURE

966
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
EXACTLY SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE

967
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
AFTER.

968
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
>> WELL, HE MUST HAVE IMPARTED

969
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SO MUCH WISDOM TO YOU OVER THE

970
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
YEARS.
>> HE HAS BEEN AN AMAZING

971
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
MENTOR.

972
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I USED TO SIT -- I'M NOT SURE HE

973
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
EVEN KNOWS I DID THIS.

974
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
BUT I USED TO SIT IN A CHAIR OR

975
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
ON THE COUCH OR SOMETHING IN THE

976
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
SAME ROOM.

977
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
HE'S BE ON THE PHONE NEGOTIATING

978
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
SOMETHING AND I'D JUST LISTEN TO

979
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
HIM.
I'D ONLY HEAR ONE SIDE OF THE

980
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
CONVERSATION, BUT THAT WAS

981
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF

982
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING OF THE AND I

983
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
MEAN IT WAS AN AMAZING

984
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
EXPERIENCE.
>> YOU HAVE THIS FOUNDATION

985
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
INVOLVED VERY MUCH WITH HUNGER

986
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
AND CHARITY WORK, YOU VISITED

987
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THE CONGO WITH BEN AFFLECK.

988
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OBVIOUSLY A PASSION OF YOURS.

989
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
>> WELL, I JUST GOT BACK FROM

990
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
EASTERN CONGO ABOUT FOUR DAYS

991
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
AGO, THE SECOND TRIP IN FIVE

992
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
WEEKS.

993
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
CONGO IS AN AREA WHERE A LOT OF

994
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE DEBATE

995
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
WRONG.

996
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'VE BEEN

997
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
TALKING ALL ABOUT SUSAN RICE AND

998
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I DON'T KNOW THE POLITICS OF

999
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
SUSAN RICE.

1000
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SHE MADE A STATEMENT WHICH IS

1001
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
DEAD RIGHT, WHICH IS IF IT ISN'T

1002
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THEM IN 23, IT WILL BE THEM.

1003
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
SINCE 1990 IT HAS NOT MOVED AND

1004
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
STILL HAS REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM

1005
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
OF THE U.N. INDEX FOR POVERTY

1006
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
AND HUMAN SUFFERING.

1007
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
SO -- AND IT RANKS ALMOST DEAD

1008
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
LAST AND MO ABRAMS INDEX NEXT TO

1009
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
SOMALIA.

1010
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I WAS IN SOMALIA ABOUT FIVE

1011
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
WEEKS AGO.
I TELL YOU, I CAN UNDERSTAND

1012
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THAT.
SO IT'S A TOUGH PLACE, IT'S A

1013
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
TOUGH -- IT'S FULL OF ATROCITIES

1014
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

1015
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

1016
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC TO DO A

1017
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
BETTER JOB AND TO TAKE EASTERN

1018
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
CONGO AND TURN IT -- IT HAS

1019
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
INCREDIBLE MINERAL -- SOME OF

1020
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
THE ESTIMATES ARE $24 TRILLION

1021
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OF WEALTH TO BRING OUT IN THE

1022
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
FUTURE.
IT COULD BE A VERY RICH COUNTRY.

1023
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> LET'S TALK BRIEFLY THE FISCAL

1024
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
CLIFF.

1025
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL

1026
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
ABOUT TAXES.

1027
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
HE SAYS COME ON, BRING IT TO ME,

1028
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
TAX ME MORE.

1029
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL BE IN THE

1030
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
FIRING LINE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A

1031
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
POOR MAN, ARE YOU.

1032
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
ARE YOU HAPPY YOUR FATHER IS

1033
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
LEADING THIS CALL FOR YOU TO

1034
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
GET --
>> NO, BECAUSE I HEAR FROM ALL

1035
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO DON'T

1036
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
LIKE IT.
YOU KNOW, THE FISCAL CLIFF, YOU

1037
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
TALK ABOUT IT, IT'S LIKE -- YOU

1038
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
KNOW, IT'S THE RESULT OF POOR

1039
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
BEHAVIOR.

1040
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED.

1041
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
YOU KNOW, ON THE OTHER HAND THE

1042
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WORLD DOESN'T END TOMORROW IF WE

1043
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
GO OFF THE CLIFF.

1044
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
COKE SELLS COCA-COLA, BURLINGTON

1045
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
NORTHERN HAULS FREIGHT.

1046
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I WILL TELL YOU, I THINK OF THE

1047
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
FISCAL CLIFF A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.

1048
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I PUT IT -- I THINK IT'S

1049
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
RELATIVE TO THE WORLD.

1050
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
EVERYBODY IN THE EASTERN CONGO

1051
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
GETS UP AND THEY'RE FALLING OFF

1052
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF EVERY MORNING

1053
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
WHEN THEY GET OUT OF BED TRYING

1054
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN FEED

1055
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THEIR CHILD LIVING ON $1 A DAY

1056
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
OR HALF A DOLLAR A DAY.

1057
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
SO I THINK IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

1058
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
AND THE WORLD DOESN'T END.

1059
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT GOING

1060
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
OFF THE CLIFF ISN'T THE SLAP IN

1061
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THE FACE WE NEED TO SAY, FOLKS,

1062
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WE NEED TO DO BETTER.

1063
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
>> WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO PAY

1064
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
MORE TAX?
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO PAY

1065
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
MORE TAX.

1066
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IT

1067
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
AMOUNTS TO.

1068
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
WHEN MY DAD STARTED TALKING

1069
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
ABOUT THIS I STARTED PAYING

1070
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
ATTENTION TO WHAT TAX I PAID.

1071
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'M IN THE 35% TAX BRACKET.

1072
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
BUT I WENT BACK AND FIGURED IT

1073
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
OUT -- I SHOULD SAY MY WIFE WENT

1074
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
BACK AND FIGURED IT OUT, SHE DID

1075
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
ALL THE WORK.

1076
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE PAID JUST

1077
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
UNDER 24% ON AN AVERAGE ACROSS

1078
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE FIVE YEARS.

1079
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I THINK IF PEOPLE PAID WHAT THEY

1080
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY WITHIN THE

1081
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
TAX BRACKET, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

1082
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
RAISE TAXES.
>> FINAL QUESTION, WHAT ON EARTH

1083
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
DO YOU BUY WARREN BUFFETT FOR

1084
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
CHRISTMAS?

1085
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
>> NOW YOU'VE PUT ME ON THE
SPOT.

1086
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK --

1087
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000

1263
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
FROM A DOCUMENTARY MAKER

1264
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
POINTING OF VIEW?

1265
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
>> WELL, THE STORY HAD SO MANY

1266
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
TWISTS AND TURNS BUT AT THE END

1267
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
OF THE DAY THERE WAS A MAN ON

1268
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
DEATH ROW AND TWO SERVING LIFE

1269
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
SENTENCES FOR SOMETHING THEY

1270
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
DIDN'T DO.

1271
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I THINK THE MOST GRIPPING THING

1272
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WAS THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED AS

1273
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
IF THEY PERPETRATED THESE

1274
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
SATANIC MURDERS.

1275
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
ONCE WE DISCOVERED THAT SNAPPING

1276
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
TURTLES ACTUALLY CAUSED THE

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
WOUNDS THAT WERE BEING JUDGED AS

1278
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
KNIFE WOUNDS, THIS WAS A WHOLE

1279
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
DIFFERENT MURDER CASE.

1280
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A CLIP

1281
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
FROM THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT

1282
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
PERTAINS EXACTLY TO WHAT YOU

1283
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
JUST MENTIONED.

1284
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
>> IF YOU ASK ME, THE SING IT

1285
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
GREATEST OFFENSE COMMITTED IN

1286
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THIS CASE IS WHAT WAS DONE BY

1287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
JOHN WITH THE KNIFE AND THE LEG.

1288
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
>> GOING DIVERS SEARCHED A SMAL

1289
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AND THAT SEARCH PRODUCED A

1290
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
KNIFE.
>> TO GO OUT THERE IN THIS BIG

1291
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
POND AND TO GO RIGHT THERE AND

1292
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
JUST LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AND

1293
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
COME UP WITH THIS KNIFE, I MEAN,

1294
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
YOU WIN THE LOTTERY.

1295
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>> WIN THE LOTTERY.
OF COURSE THE LOTTERY TURNED OUT

1296
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
TO BE A SHAMEFUL FARCE, DIDN'T

1297
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
IT?

1298
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
>> AND WHAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR WAS

1299
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ACTUALLY THAT THAT KNIFE WAS

1300
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
ACTUALLY THROWN IN THE LAKE A

1301
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
YEAR BEFORE THE MURDERS EVEN

1302
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
HAPPENED AND IT ACTUALLY WAS

1303
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
USED IN THE TRIAL TO CONVICT

1304
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THESE GUYS.

1305
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
SO IT WAS JUST SUCH A TRAGEDY IN

1306
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THE MAKING.

1307
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
>> AND IN RELATION TO THE WOUNDS

1308
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TO THESE POOR BOYS, AND WE'LL

1309
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
COME TO THE FACT THERE'S NEVER

1310
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
BEEN ANYONE REALLY WHO ACTUALLY

1311
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
DID THIS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, THE

1312
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS

1313
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
DOCUMENTARY UNRAVELS IS THAT

1314
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THESE WOUNDS WERE MUCH MORE

1315
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

1316
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
TURTLES THAN BY A KNIFE.

1317
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1318
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THERE WAS NO DEPTH TO THE

1319
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
WOUNDS, THEY WERE SCRATCH MARKS.
BUT PEOPLE WERE PRESENTED WITH

1320
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THE INFORMATION AS IF THEY WERE

1321
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
STABBED TO DEATH.

1322
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
AND THERE WAS NO DEPTH.

1323
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THERE WAS NO ORGAN DAMAGE OR

1324
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
ANYTHING.
>> THE DOCUMENTARY IS VERY

1325
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
POWERFUL.
IT TALKS OF BEING THE FIRST

1326
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
CROWD SOURCED INVESTIGATION

1327
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
EVER, AND YOU WORKED WITH

1328
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
INVESTIGATORS AND FORENSIC TEAMS

1329
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
TO REVEAL FALSE CONFESSIONS,

1330
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
JUNK SCIENCE AND THE PROSECUT

1331
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

1332
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE THIS WAS A
CLOSED CASE AND THEY WERE

1333
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
CONVICTED, EVERYTHING BECAME
AVAILABLE ON THE PUBLIC RECORD

1334
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
AND PEOPLE WERE FASCINATED WITH

1335
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
THIS STORY FOR ALL DIFFERENT

1336
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
REASONS AND STARTED GOING DOWN

1337
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
TO THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE

1338
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
DEPARTMENT AND TAKING PICTURES

1339
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
OF EVIDENCE AND THEN THE

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
INTERNET BEGAN TO GET -- TO

1341
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY.

1342
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
AND SO PEOPLE WERE LIKE -- IF

1343
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
THEY WERE TRYING THE CASE ONLINE

1344
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
BASICALLY.
AND IT JUST BECAME THIS MASSIVE

1345
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
CALL TO ACTION.

1346
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
>> LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

1347
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I WANT TO COME BACK AND TALK

1348
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000

THE DOCUMENTARY, YOU CAN'T WATCH

1443
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
THAT WITHOUT SHAKING YOUR HEAD

1444
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
REALLY ABOUT THE LIFE THAT
HAPPENED FOR YOU FOR NEARLY TWO

1445
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
DECADES.

1446
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
IT'S A COMPLETELY WASTED LIFE

1447
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
UNTIL THE STAGE OF WHERE YOU ARE

1448
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
NOW.
REALLY SHOCKING.

1449
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE OTHER SHOCKING THING, OF

1450
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
COURSE, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN

1451
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
EXECUTED BY NOW.

1452
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> RIGHT.
>> 53 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXECUTED

1453
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
SINCE YOU WERE RELEASED.

1454
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
11 IN 2011, 42 THIS YEAR.

1455
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, GIVEN YOUR

1456
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF
DEATH ROW, GIVEN WHAT WE NOW

1457
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
KNOW ABOUT  WHAT WE NOW

1458
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
KNOW ABOUT DNA WITH AND THE WAY

1459
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
IT'S BEEN EXONERATING MANY

1460
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW, WHAT DO YOU

1461
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THINK OF IT?

1462
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY NIGHTMARISH.

1463
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF CASES

1464
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE DNA

1465
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THAT THE PEOPLE COULD VERY WELL

1466
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
BE INNOCENT AND EVEN IF THEY'RE

1467
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
NOT, YOU KNOW WBT MEDIA SORT OF

1468
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
PORTRAYS THIS IMAGE TO SOCIETY

1469
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
THAT DEATH ROW IS FULL OF, YOU

1470
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
KNOW, CRIMINAL GENIUS HAN BELL

1471
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
HANNIBAL LEKTER TYPE AND THEY

1472
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
ARE NOT.

1473
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THEY SAY THEY DON'T EXECUTE THE

1474
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
MENTALLY INSANE OR MENTALLY

1475
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
HANDICAP AND THEY DO.

1476
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU

1477
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
ENCOUNTER ON DEATH ROW THAT YOU

1478
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
BASICALLY BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN

1479
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
INNOCENT?
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE TIME WAYS

1480
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
THERE PROBABLY THREE OTHERS.

1481
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
ONE WAS EXECUTED, PROBABLY WILL

1482
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
BE EXECUTED IN THE UPCOMING

1483
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
YEAR.

1484
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
ONE HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF

1485
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
GETTING OUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT

1486
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE MEDIA

1487
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
INTEREST IN HIS CASE.

1488
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
>> WHAT DNA EVIDENCE HAD IT BEEN

1489
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
AROUND WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED,

1490
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
HAVE CLEARED YOU FROM THE START?

1491
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1492
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CONVICT

1493
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
US SO BADLY.

1494
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
WE HAD OTHER THINGS LIKE ALIBIS,

1495
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
PEOPLE THAT COULD TESTIFY TO

1496
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
WHERE WE WERE AT THE TIME AND

1497
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
CAN PLAINLY PROVE THAT WE

1498
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
WEREN'T AT THE CRIME SCENE.

1499
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
THEY SEEN HAVE JESSE MESCELLI

1500
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SIGNING A LOG BOOK AND PHOTOS

1501
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
ABOUT HIM.
SO TECHNICALLY IT IS POSSIBLE

1502
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
THAT THEY COULD HAVE SHOWED THEM

1503
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
THE DNA AND THEY WERE SO ENRAGED

1504
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
AT THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

1505
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
CONVICTED US ANYWAY.

1506
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
>> HAVE YOU TATTOOS THAT YOU

1507
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
DIDN'T HAVE LAST TIME.

1508
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
WHAT DO ME MEAN?

1509
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
>> IT HELPS ME DEAL.

1510
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
IT IS VERY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

1511
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
EMOTIONALLY SOOTHING TO ME.

1512
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
IT IS ALSO LIKE PUTTING ON A

1513
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
SUIT OF ARMOR.
LIKE IT GIVES YOU SOME SORT OF

1514
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
LEVEL OF -- LIKE A BUFFER ZONE

1515
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
BETWEEN YOU AND THE REST OF THE
WORLD.

1516
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> WHAT ARE THE ONES ON YOUR

1517
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
KNUCKLES?
>> THESE ARE RUINS.

1518
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
USUALLY WHEN I GET TATTOOS I GET

1519
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL TO ME.

1520
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
LIKE I SAID, IT IS A SUST ARMOR

1521
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
SO I LOOK TO PUT ON A SUIT OF

1522
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
ARMOR MADE OUT OF THINGS I LOVE.

1523
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
LIKE WINTER, SNOW, ARCH ANGEL

1524
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
MICHAEL.
SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING

1525
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
TO ME PERSONALLY.

1526
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
>> DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH

1527
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
JASON AND JESSE?

1528
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
>> JASON AND I, I HATE MORE THAN

1529
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
ANYTHING TALKING ON THE PHONE.

1530
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
BUT WE WILL TEXT.

1531
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
JESSE, FROM WHAT I HEARD,

1532
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH

1533
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
ANYONE.
HE ONLY HAD A 68 IQ TO BEGIN

1534
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
WITH AND THEN YOU DUMP ON THIS.

1535
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
THEY MADE SURE HE WON'T LIVE

1536
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
ANYTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A

1537
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
NORMAL LIFE.

1538
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
AND HE IS A SHUT-IN.

1539
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
>> IT IS A HEART BREAKING STORY,

1540
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
AS WELL AS SHOCKING STORY.

1541
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THESE ARE THREE LIVED VIRTUALLY

1542
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
RUINS AND MAYBE IN JESSE'S CASE,

1543
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
COMPLETELY RUINED.

1544
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
>> I FELL LIKE WEST OF MEMPHIS

1545
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY AND I

1546
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
FEEL LIKE WE HAD BEAUTIFUL

1547
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE INSIDE

1548
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
STORY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND

1549
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THE LOVE STORY AND I FEEL LIKE,

1550
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
THAT'S THE HAPPY ENDING THAT

1551
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THIS

1552
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
STORY.
IS TO SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY

1553
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
HAPPENED THAT THEY ALL CAME OUT.

1554
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> THIS IS THE WORST THING ABOUT

1555
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, IS

1556
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1557
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
STILL SAY, WELL, THERE'S NO

1558
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE.

1559
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THEY HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE REAL

1560
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
KILLER.

1561
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THIS IS THE TERRIBLE STIGMA YOU

1562
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
CARRY WITH YOU.
>> IT IS.

1563
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
AND IT WILL HANG OVER OUR HEADS.

1564
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1565
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE

1566
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
DAY AFTER DAY.

1567
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
IT IS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE TO

1568
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ME.
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, IMAGINE

1569
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORST

1570
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU

1571
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

1572
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF WE

1573
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
DON'T KEEP DOING IT, WE WILL

1574
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
HAVE THAT STIGMA HANGING O OVER

1575
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
OUR HEADS.

1576
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
WE HAVE TO KEEP LETTING THE

1577
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
STATE OF ARKANSAS KNOW WE'RE NOT

1578
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU DO THE

1579
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
RIGHT THING.
>> HOW IMPORTANT TO YOU AND

1580
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
POWERFUL TO YOU HAS IT BEEN TO

1581
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HAVE LORI'S UNEQUIVOCAL BACKING

1582
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
AND SUPPORT TO YOU.

1583
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> I COULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED IN

1584
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
PRISON AND OUT OF PRISON WITHOUT

1585
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
HER.

1586
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
WHEN I CON TAKE ANOTHER STEP

1587
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WHEN I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T GO

1588
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
ON, IT WAS HER.

1589
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
SHE IS WHAT WOULD CARRY ME

1590
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
FORWARD, MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,

1591
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SPIRITUALLY UNTIL I COULD WALK

1592
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
AGAIN.

1593
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
>> IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

1594
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
>> THANK YOU.

1595
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> I WISH YOU THE VERY BEST, ALL

1596
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
OF YOU, WITH THE DOCUMENTARY.

1597
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
IT IS A VERY POWERFUL FILM.

1598
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I URGE PEOPLE TO SEE IT.

1599
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THEY STILL HAVE NO REAL IDEA

1600
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, AND TO

1601
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
