DO WE THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

70

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HEALTH CONTROL ISSUES.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000

FRIDAY IN DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HE BELIEVES ACTION NEEDS TO BE

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
TAKEN.
HE WAS PRESSED ON SOME OF THESE

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SUNDAY SHOWS.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG SAYING

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT AND NOT A

VAGUE PROMISE, HE NEEDS TO

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
FOLLOW-UP ON GUN CONTROL.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THERE ARE OTHERS WAIT A SECOND,

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DON'T TRY TO CAPITALIZE WITH

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SOME SORT OF LEGISLATION THAT

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
PRESCRIPTION.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THERE WILL BE A BIG DEBATE BUT

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'M TOLD THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD TALKING

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ABOUT PRAYER AND REMEMBRANCE.

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000

UP.

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HE IS THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
AS A PARENT AND NOT JUST AS A

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000

112

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I WOULD IMAGINE, YOU ARE THERE

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ON THE GROUND, I WOULD IMAGINE

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000

PRESIDENT TO ISSUE THOSE WORDS

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
OR TO TALK ABOUT THAT TOPIC

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I MET A GENTLEMAN THAT HELPED US

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
HE IS FACING PRESSURE FROM MAYOR

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
BLOOMBERG AND OTHERS.

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WHITE HOUSE AIDES ARE SAYING

194
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THAT PRESSURE IS NOT GOING TO GO

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000

FIGHTING IT OUT ON VARIOUS

214
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000

BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT A GOOD

569
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
CREDIT SCORE, TAKE CARE OF YOUR

570
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
CREDIT CARD BILL?

571
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH WEIGHS

572
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
ON CREDIT SCORES.

573
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
58%, COMPARE TO MORTGAGE LENDERS

574
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
TO 7% AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL

575
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
LENDERS.

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
SO TAKING CARE OF YOUR CREDIT IS

577
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

578
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO

579
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
RENTED A HOME OR ANY KIND OF

580
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
LOAN AT ALL.

581
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

582
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
>> Rick: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

583
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
HAVE A BAD CREDIT SCORE, YOU HAD

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A ROUGH AS SO MANY PEOPLE IN A

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
ROUGH ECONOMY AND YOU FELL

586
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
BEHIND A LITTLE BIT.

587
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
YOUR CREDIT SCORE HAS DIPPED.

588
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU?

589
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
>> THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE

590
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
REALLY HARD TO GET A LOAN.

591
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
IT WILL BE HARD TO RENT A PLACE.

592
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
IT AFFECTS ANYTHING, IF YOU WANT

593
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
TO BORROW OR GET CREDIT, IT WILL

594
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
IMPACT YOUR ABILITY TO DO SO.

595
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
BASICALLY WHAT THE CREDIT SCORE

596
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
LOOKS AT IS YOUR ABILITY TO

597
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
REPAY A DEBT.

598
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN REPAYING

599
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
DEBT PARTICULARLY ON CREDIT CARD

600
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
SOMEONE IS GOING TO LOOK AT THAT

601
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
AND LOW CREDIT SCORE.

602
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
BECAUSE OF THAT, WHY SHOULD ERIC

603
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
GIVING THEM MONEY IF THEY ARE

604
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
NOT WILLING TO PAY IT BACK IN

605
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THE PAST.

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
>> Rick: LET'S TALK ABOUT

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
BALANCES.

608
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
EVERYBODY GETS A STATEMENT.

609
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
YOU CAN PAY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
OR YOU CAN PAY IT OFF IN FULL.

611
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
AS FAR AS MAINTAINING GOOD

612
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
CREDIT SCORE WHAT IS THING TO

613
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
DO?
>> DEFINITELY PAY OFF THE

614
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
MINIMUM.

615
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
IF YOU CAN'T PAY THAT OFF THAT

616
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A BLACK

617
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SPOT ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT.

618
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY

619
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
OFF THE BALANCE, OF COURSE, THAT

620
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
IS THE BEST THING TO DO FROM A

621
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
PERSONAL FINANCE STANDPOINT

622
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO AVOID

623
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
ALL THE INTERESTED FEES.

624
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
IT DOESN'T IMPACT YOUR CREDIT

625
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SCORES YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT

626
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
OF HOLE A LITTLE BIT QUICKER.

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
>> Rick: WHAT ABOUT FOLKS THAT

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ARE BUYING CHRISTMAS PRESENTS

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
AND STORE SAYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO

630
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
GET ONE OF OUR STORE CREDIT

631
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000

632
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
WE'LL TAKE 30% OFF YOUR PURCHASE

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
TODAY.

634
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
>> MOST PEOPLE DO BECAUSE YOU

635
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
GET A DISCOUNTED.

636
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU ARE NOT

637
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
GOING TO VIGILANT ABOUT

638
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
MAINTAINING THESE RETAIL CARDS,

639
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
IT'S REALLY GOING TO COST YOU

640
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
MORE IN THE END THAN JUST THAT

641
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
LITTLE DISCOUNT THAT YOU GET.

642
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
UNFORTUNATELY DURING THESE HARD

643
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
TIMES WE'RE DISCOVERING THAT

644
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
PEOPLE ARE REALLY USING THEIR

645
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
CREDIT CARDS FOR MORE THAN JUST

646
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
WANTS AND NEEDS, 30% ARE BUYING

647
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THINGS LIKE GROCERY AND PAYING

648
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
UTILITY BILLS ON CREDIT CARDS.

649
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> Rick: MAYBE A GOOD IDEA

650
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
SEASON TO PUT THE CREDIT CARD

652
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AWAY AND BUY THINGS WITH CASH.

653
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE IDEA

654
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
OF THE CREDIT SCORE.

655
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET CREDIT

656
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
OR GET A LOAN BUT THE INTEREST

657
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
RATES MIGHT GO UP?

658
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
>> RIGHT.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

659
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YOU CAN STILL GET A LOAN BUT YOU

660
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
WILL PAYING A LOT MORE.

661
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
IT'S BASICALLY THE PRICE OF

662
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
MONEY.
THAT IS WHAT CREDIT IS.

663
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
>> Rick: SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

664
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
TAKEN A HIT ON THEIR CREDIT

665
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
SCORE, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO

666
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
DIG OUT OF THAT?

667
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
>> YOU CAN DO IT.

668
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
JUST MAKE EIGHT RESOLUTION FOR

669
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
NEXT YEAR TO START PAYING OFF

670
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
THE MINIMUM FOR EXAMPLE.

671
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
IT DOESN'T TAKE SO LONG EVERY

672
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
MONTH IF IT IS CONSISTENT, THAT

673
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
IS KEY.

674
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000

DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SUFFICIENT

716
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
PROXIES OR ONLY SECRETARY OF

DISAPPOINTMENT NOT ONLY TO THE

MEMBERS OF OUR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHE WILL

DOHERTY.

732
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THESE WERE BRAVE AMERICANS THAT

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WERE SERVING OUR NATION AND AN

734
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000

735
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
ATTACK ON AMERICA.

736
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
IN THIS, WE WILL HAVE TWO OF HER

THEY ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR

742
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THE SECRETARY.

743
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
DAY BEFORE OPEN HEARING WE WILL

747
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
BE HEARING FROM THE TWO

748
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
GENTLEMEN THAT WERE IN CHARGE OF

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
REVIEW, TOM PICKERING AND

750
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
AMBASSADOR MULLEN.

751
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THEY WILL PROVIDE THIS IN A

752
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
CLASSIFIED SETTING BECAUSE THE

753
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
REPORT WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS.

755
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
THAT HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM WITH

756
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THE ADMINISTRATION.

757
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THEY WANTED TO HAVE ALL OF THE

758
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
HEARINGS AND ALL OF THE

759
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
BRIEFINGS IN A SECURED SETTING

760
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO

761
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
KNOW WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT

762
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
AND ALL OF OUR AGENCIES ARE

763
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
DOING TO KEEP OUR DIPLOMATS

764
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
SAFE.
WE ALL DESERVE AN OPEN ANSWER IN

765
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
A TRANSPARENT SETTING.

766
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
>> Arthel: IS IT POSSIBLE FOR

767
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO HEAR

768
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AND COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION

769
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AT THESE HEARINGS, AND THEN

770
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
PROPERLY INFORM THE AMERICAN

771
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
PEOPLE SO THAT IN THE EVENT THAT

772
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
RAW TESTIMONY, IF YOU WILL, SOME

773
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SECRETS ARE NOT DIVULGED.

774
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
IS THAT POSSIBLE SO THE AMERICAN

775
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
PEOPLE WON'T FEEL CHEATED IN THE

776
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
END?

777
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
>> THAT IS AN EXCELLENT

778
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
QUESTION.
THIS IS AMERICAN TAXPAYER

779
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
DOLLARS AT WORK.

780
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THEY ARE FUNDING THE OPERATIONS,

781
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NOT JUST THE CONSULATE AND THE

782
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
EMBASSIES BUT ALSO THE SECURITY

783
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
IN OUR ISLAND OF DEMOCRACY.

784
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AMERICAN

785
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE USED WISELY

786
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND MORE

787
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
MONEY.

788
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WE NEED TO SPEND THE MONEY WE

789
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
HAVE IN A BETTER WAY.

790
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
IN BENGHAZI THE REPORTS WE HAVE

791
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
HEARD THAT THERE WERE CALLS AND

792
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THEY WERE VERY CLEAR REQUESTS

793
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
FOR ADDED SECURITY.

794
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THOSE REQUESTS WERE NOT HEEDED.

795
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I KNOW THAT CONGRESS WOULD HAVE

796
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
FULLY FUNDED ANY OF THESE

797
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
SECURITY REQUESTS.

798
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
WE WANT TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
WISELY.

800
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
>> Arthel: WE'RE SHORT ON TIME.

801
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE POINTS

802
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
YOU WANT TO HAVE ANSWERED FOR

803
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
SURE.
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY ADAMANT

804
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ABOUT HEARING FROM SECRETARY OF

805
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
STATE CLINTON.

806
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
HAVE YOU HEARD ANY INFORMATION

807
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
FROM HER OFFICE THAT SHE MIGHT

808
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE SPECIAL

809
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
HEARINGS?

810
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> WE HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO

812
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
HER OFFICE THAT WE DO EXPECT HER

813
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
TO TESTIFY.

814
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
SHE HAS EVERY EXPECTATION SHE

815
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
WILL BE TESTIFYING, BUT

816
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU KNOW, SHE

817
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
HAS ALREADY STATED SHE WILL BE

818
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
STEPPING DOWN.

819
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD REPORTS

820
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THAT SENATOR KERRY WHO IS NOW

821
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HEADING THE SENATE FOREIGN

822
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
RELATIONS COMMITTEE WILL BE

823
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
TAKING HER SPOT.

824
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I FEAR BECAUSE OF THE SHUFFLE

825
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THAT IS GOING ON WE MAY NOT BE

826
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
ABLE TO HEAR FROM SECRETARY

827
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
CLINTON ON THE BENGHAZI

828
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
TERRORIST ATTACK.

829
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WE WILL BE A POORER NATION FOR

830
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IT.

831
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
>> Arthel: THERE IS NO WAY

832
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
SECRETARY CLINTON STEPS DOWN AND

833
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
NEW SECRETARY OF STATE IS IN

834
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
PLACE, THERE IS NO WAY TO CALL

835
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
MRS. CLINTON BACK TO TESTIFY?

836
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>> WE HOPE THAT SHE WILL FULFILL

837
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
HER DESIRE TO COME BEFORE OUR

838
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
COMMITTEE.

839
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
WE HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN.

840
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THEY HAVE NOT SHUT THE DOOR ON

841
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THAT, BUT I KNOW AS ROBERT FROST

842
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SAYS, WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL

843
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
HAPPEN.

844
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
WE HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION SHE

845
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
WILL.

846
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THAT IS OUR STRICT REQUEST AND

847
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
WE HOPE SHE MAKES GOOD ON IT.

848
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
>> Arthel: IS THERE ANY WAY TO

849
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
ENSURE THAT THESE HEARINGS WILL

850
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
NOT BE POLITICIZED?

851
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
IF YOU WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

852
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
TO GET THE REAL ANSWERS YOU HAVE

853
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
TO KEEP POLITICS OUT OF IT.

854
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>> IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP

855
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
POLITICS OUT OF ANYTHING WE DO

856
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
IN CONGRESS.

857
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

858
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
TERRORIST ATTACK WITH FOUR

859
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES, EVEN

860
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THOUGH THEY REQUESTED MORE

861
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
SECURITY AND MORE HELP.

862
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG

863
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
AND TO PREVENT ANOTHER BENGHAZI.

864
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AMERICAN LIVES ARE AT STAKE ALL

865
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
OVER THE WORLD.

866
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
WE ARE TARGETS.

867
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

868
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ANOTHER BENGHAZI IS NOT GOING TO

869
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
HAPPEN AND ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO

870
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THAT IS EXAMINE WHAT HAPPENED

871
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
WITH THIS ONE.

872
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
>> Arthel: CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
DREADING TO HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT

GIRL, BLONDE AND ALWAYS SMILING.

896
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
SHE WAS A BUDDING ARTIST WHO

897
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
FEELING BECAUSE THEY KNOW SO

MANY OTHER PARENTS ARE SUFFERING

933
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
>> Rick: MOLLY, THANK YOU.

935
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> Arthel: AND AMID THAT SORROW

936
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
AND GRIEF THE QUESTION MANY ARE

937
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
ASKING THIS WEEKEND, WHAT SET

938
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THE GUNMAN ON THE PATH THAT MADE

939
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
HIM COMMIT ONE OF THE MOST

940
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
INFAMOUS CRIMES IN HISTORY.

941
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
A FORMER DETECTIVE WITH THE

942
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT.

943
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
GOOD MORNING, PATRICK.

944
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
POLICE ARE COLLECT VERY GOOD

945
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
GOOD EVIDENCE THEY GOT AT HIS

946
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
HOME.

947
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES MAY BE

948
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
LOOKING FOR AT THIS POINT?

949
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO

950
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
RECONSTRUCT NOT JUST THE

951
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
MOVEMENTS GOING BACKWARDS OF

952
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
ADAM BUT HIS ENTIRE LIFESTYLE.

953
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THEY WANT TO CONNECT THE DOTS

954
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
AND TIE TOGETHER E-MAILS AND

955
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
VOICEMAIL MESSAGES.

956
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
TO RECONSTRUCT NOT ONLY HOW IT

957
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
HAPPENED BUT WHY IT HAPPENED.

958
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> Arthel: THAT IS THE QUESTION

959
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
WE ARE HOPING TO FIND SOME

960
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ANSWERS TO.

961
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE ALSO

962
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
SAYING THERE IS A WOMAN WHO WAS

963
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WOUNDED IN THE SHOOTING.

964
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
SAYING THAT SHE IS INSTRUMENTAL

965
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
IN THE INVESTIGATION AT THIS

966
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
POINT.
WHO MIGHT ELSE BE ABLE TO HELP

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
PROVIDE CRUCIAL INFORMATION AT

968
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THIS TIME?
>> THE WOMAN THAT THEY ARE

969
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
REFERRING TO IS THE VICE

970
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
PRINCIPAL THAT SURVIVED WHEN THE

971
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND PRINCIPAL

972
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
LUNGED LEFT SIDE AT THE SHOOTER.

973
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS, WHAT IN

974
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
PARTICULAR WHAT HE SAID.

975
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
THIS IS AN INTERVIEWHE

976
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
CHILDREN.
THAT WILL BE A LONG, PAINFUL

977
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
PROCESS.

978
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
SO THIS ADULT SBIEV IS A

979
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
POTENTIAL KEY WITNESS.

980
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> Arthel: AT WHAT POINT WILL

981
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVE

982
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
PROVIDED EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS.

983
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
WILL AUTHORITIES TO HAVE SIT

984
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THEM DOWN AND FURTHER QUESTION

985
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THEM AS TO WHAT THEY SAW, WHAT

986
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THEY HEARD.

987
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
>> IT'S AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION

988
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WITH MANY MOVING PARTS.

989
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THERE IS LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE

990
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
UNANSWERED AND CERTAIN

991
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
UNMITIGATED FACTS.

992
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I WOULD SPECULATE THEY WOULD

993
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BEGIN THAT PAINFUL PROCESS OF

994
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
MASSAGING OUT VARIOUS EYEWITNESS

995
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
DETAILS FROM THE CHILDREN IN THE

996
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
COMING DAYS.

997
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
>> Arthel: THEN THERE IS

998
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
COMPUTER THAT WAS FOUND AT THE

999
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
SHOOTER'S HOME.

1000
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WHAT MIGHT BE ON THAT COMPUTER

1001
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THAT AUTHORITIES WILL BE LOOKING

1002
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
FOR?

1003
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> THEY WILL BE INTERESTED IN

1004
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
ALL ACTIVITY ON THAT COMPUTER.

1005
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
E-MAILS IN AND OUT.

1006
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
CONTENT OF E-MAILS, VARIOUS

1007
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
SITES THAT THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE

1008
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
VISITED AND WHAT THE RELEVANCE

1009
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
TO THE BROADER PICTURE.

1010
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
UNDERSTAND THEY WILL WANT TO

1011
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
RECONSTRUCT THE LIVES FROM THE

1012
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
THREE WEAPONS, FROM THE WORK

1013
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
BENCH UNTIL 9:40 A.M. ON FRIDAY

1014
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THE 14th BECAUSE THERE MAY HAVE

1015
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
BEEN OTHER SHOOTINGS ATTACHED TO

1016
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THOSE WEAPONS.

1017
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
>> Arthel: IS THERE ANY

1018
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE WILL BE

1019
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
HELD CULPABLE IN TERMS OF PAYING

1020
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
A CRIMINAL PRICE FOR THIS,

1021
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
CRIMINAL CHARGES?

1022
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY.

1023
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
IT'S AN EVOLVING CASE BUT THE

1024
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
INITIAL FACTS AS THEY HAVE BEEN

1025
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ASCERTAINED SEEM TO SUPPORT THE

1026
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
SOLE SHOOTER AND SOLE SHOOTER

1027
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
CULPABILITY.

1028
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
AT THIS JUNCTURE IT SEEMS LIKE

1029
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
ADAM LANZA ALONE FROM THE FACTS

1030
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WE KNOW.
>> AS AUTHORITIES COLLECT

1031
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
INFORMATION IN THE COMING DAYS

1032
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
AND WEEKS AND PERHAPS MONTHS

1033
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
PERHAPS WE WILL AT SOME POINT

1034
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
FIND OUT WHY WHICH WILL NOT

1035
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
CHANGE THAT HORRIFIC EVENT THAT

1036
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
TOOK PLACE.

1037
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS

1038
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
TODAY.
>> Rick: TOMORROW IS A SCHOOL

1039
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
DAY AND CALLS FOR STRONGER

1040
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
SECURITY MEASURES AT OUR

1041
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
NATION'S SCHOOLS GETTING LOUD

1042
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
THEY ARE THE WAKE OF THIS

1043
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
MASSACRE.

1044
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
SOME EXPERTS SAY THERE ISN'T

1045
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
MUCH MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO

1046
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IMPROVE CAMPUS SAFETY.

1047
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
WHERE DO AMERICAN SCHOOLS STAND

1048
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
RIGHT NOW?

1049
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL

1050
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
SAFETY AND SECURITY

1051
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
ADMINISTRATION WEIGHS IN NEXT.

1052
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

1053
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Mmmm tasty.

1054
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And cut! Very good.

1055
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1056
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1057
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1058
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's not real.

1059
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1060
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1061
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1062
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

1063
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
>>.

1064
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
>> Arthel: THE CONNECTICUT

1065
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
TRAGEDY THRUST SCHOOL SAFETY

1066
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BACK IN THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT.

1067
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
USING SECURITY MEASURES, CHECK

1068
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
INS AND METAL DETECTORS.

1069
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT

1070
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
OUR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE.

1071
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
JOINING US IS KEN TRUMP.

1072
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
YOU ARE A CONSULTANT FOR SCHOOLS

1073
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
AND YOU HELP THEM DEVICE PLANS

1074
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE.

1075
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'M GOING DROP MY KINDERGARTENER

1076
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
OFF TO SCHOOL TOMORROW MORNING

1077
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
AND I'M GOING TO WALK AWAY AND

1078
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'M GOING TO THINK IS THAT

1079
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
SCHOOL SAFE.

1080
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE?

1081
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
>> WELL, PARENTS DEFINITELY NEED

1082
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL

1083
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
TOMORROW.
SCHOOL WILL BE THE SAFEST PLACE

1084
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THEY CAN BE BUT SIX YEARS DOWN

1085
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THE ROAD WE HOPE WE'RE HAVING

1086
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION THAT

1087
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
WE'RE HAVING TODAY.

1088
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE DON'T

1089
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
NEED TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW

1090
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
PLAYBOOK WITH NEW PRACTICES AND

1091
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
PROCEDURES TEACHING KIDS TO

1092
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
ATTACK ARMED INTRUDERS.

1093
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
FOCUS ON THE FUNDAMENTALS AND

1094
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
HAVE CRISIS TEAMS, SUPPORT OUR

1095
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND

1096
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
POLICE OFFICERS AND LOOK AT

1097
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
THOSE PROGRAMS.

1098
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE AFTER

1099
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
COLUMBINE ON BUILDING

1100
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS TO

1101
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
PREVENT VIOLENCE.

1102
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
MAKING SURE SCHOOLS ARE WORKING

1103
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WITH POLICE AND WHOLE LIST OF

1104
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
OTHER THINGS.

1105
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO WE

1106
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY.

1107
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
A LOT OF SCHOOL SAFETY FUNDS

1108
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
HAVE BEEN CUT AND WE NEED MOST

1109
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
OF ALL TO SPEND MORE TIME

1110
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WORKING ON THIS.

1111
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
>> Rick: I THINK THERE WOULD BE

1112
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
A GREATER APPETITE OR DISCUSSION

1113
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
ABOUT PUT SOMETHING MONEY BACK

1114
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
INTO THE SYSTEM FOR SECURITY

1115
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
NEEDS.

1116
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I TALKED TO A GUEST YESTERDAY,

1117
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
KEN, WHO TOLD ME THAT ALL THESE

1118
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
SHOOTINGS TAKE PLACE IN WHAT

1119
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THEY CALL GUN FREE ZONES.

1120
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
IF TEACHERS WERE ARMED AND BRAVE

1121
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
PRINCIPAL HAD BEEN ARMED SHE

1122
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP

1123
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
THIS.

1124
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

1125
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
>> I STRONGLY BASED SCHOOL BASED

1126
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
POLICE OFFICERS.

1127
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
OUR LAW OFFICERS WERE TRAINED TO

1128
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WITH FIREARMS.

1129
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I THINK TEACHERS WANT TO BE

1130
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
ARMED WITH TEXTBOOKS IN THE

1131
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
SCHOOLS TO TEACH.

1132
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
OFFICERS HAVE PREVENTED MANY

1133
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
MORE TRAGEDIES THAN WHAT WE SAW

1134
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
IN NEWTOWN LAST WEEK BUT WE ALSO

1135
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
NEED AND SOMETIMES TO INTERVENE.

1136
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
>> Rick: I HAVE TO JUMP IN.

1137
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US.

1138
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
POLICE ARE HOLDING ANOTHER PRESS

1139
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
CONFERENCE.

1140
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
THAT IS LIEUTENANT VANCE.

1141
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
LET'S LISTEN.

1142
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
HER DEATH HAS BEEN RULED AS

1147
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000

ADAM LANZA.

1151
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
HIS CAUSE OF DEATH IS GUNSHOT

1152
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
WOUNDS AND HIS DEATH HAS BEEN

1153
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
RULED AS SUICIDE.

1154
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT

1155
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
WEAPONRY.

1156
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAN

1157
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
BE RELEASED AT THIS TIME.

1158
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THE WEAPON THAT WAS UTILIZED

1159
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
MOST OF THE TIME DURING THIS

1160
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
HORRIFIC CRIME WAS IDENTIFIED AS

1161
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
BUSHMASTER AR-15 ASSAULT WEAPON.

1162
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000

1166
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
FOURTH WEAPON WAS A SHOTGUN THAT

1167
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
WAS RECOVERED FROM THE SUSPECT'S

1168
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
VEHICLE THAT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE

1169
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000

1170
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THAT WEAPONRY IS GOING, AS I

1171
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000

1172
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000

00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
IT WILL BE HISTORICALLY SEARCHED

1174
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000

1175
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
WHAT WE STATED THIS MORNING, BUT

1181
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
ANYONE THAT HARASSES, THREATENS

1182
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000

1183
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000

1184
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000

1189
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT LAST.

1190
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
INCLUDES, IN PERSONAL CONTACT

1191
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.

1194
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
WE AGAIN ARE ASKING AND

1195
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
IMPLORING MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA

1196
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
TO PLEASE RESPECT THE FAMILIES'

1197
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
PRIVACY.

1198
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
WE ARE CONTINUING TO STAFF A

1199
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
LINE OF COMMUNICATION TO ASSIST

1200
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000

INDEFINITELY.

1204
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

1205
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
AGAIN, UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE

1206
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE STILL

1207
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
CANNOT ANSWER AND CANNOT

1208
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
DISCUSS.

1209
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THERE WAS IN FACT A THREAT AT

1210
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THE ST. ROSE CHURCH HERE IN

1211
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
NEWTOWN.

1212
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THE CHURCH AND EVERYTHING IS

1213
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
TAKEN EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY.

1214
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THE CHURCH WAS EVACUATED AS A

1215
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
PRECAUTION.

1216
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
IT WAS THOROUGHLY SEARCHED.

1217
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WE INITIATED A CRIMINAL

1218
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
INVESTIGATION.

1219
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I HAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS.

1220
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I DON'T KNOW THE CONTENT OF THE

1221
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THREAT.

1222
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
SUFFICE IT TO SAY WE TREAT THESE

1223
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
INSTANCES AS VERSUS CRIMES.

1224
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
AND IF PERPETRATOR IS IDENTIFIED

1225
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL BE

1226
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF

1227
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
THE LAW.
>> THE PHONE CALLS?

1228
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
>> THAT IS AS MUCH INFORMATION

1229
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
AS I HAVE.

1230
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> DID HE USE HANDGUNS AT ALL.

1231
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE WEAPON THAT

1232
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
NANCY WAS SHOT WITH.

1233
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

1234
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
BUSHMASTER WAS USED AS EXPLAINED

1235
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
YESTERDAY IN THE SCHOOL IN ITS

1236
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
ENTIRETY AND HEALING WAS USED TO

1237
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

1238
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
IT'S A DIRECTORY OF THE SHOTS,

1239
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
ALL OF THE AMMUNITION USED IN

1240
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
THIS HORRIFIC CRIME WILL BE

1241
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
EXAMINED AND THOROUGHLY REPORTED

1242
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
IN THE REPORT.

1243
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO

1244
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
BE ABLE TO SPECIAL LATE.

1245
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
HIGH CAPACITY, MULTIPLE HIGH

1246
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

1247
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
APPROXIMATELY 30 ROUNDS PER

1248
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
MAGAZINE.

1249
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
HUNDREDS OF BULLETS, YES.

1250
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
>> WAS IT A RIFLE OR HANDGUN.

1251
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
>> HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE FOR

1252
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THE RIFLE AND MULTIPLE MAGAZINES

1253
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
FOR THE RIFLE AND MULTIPLE

1254
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
MAGAZINES FOR BOTH HANDGUNS.

1255
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I DON'T WANT TO STATE THAT.

1256
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'M SURE THEY DID EVERYTHING

1257
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
THEY COULD.

1258
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT

1259
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
SPECIFIC DETAIL AT THIS TIME.

1260
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
AGAIN, MOTIVE AS I DISCUSSED

1261
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
EARLIER, THAT WILL COME AS WE

1262
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
FINISH THE INVESTIGATION.

1263
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
WE CAN'T PIECEMEAL IT.

1264
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC REASON

1265
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
WE CAN STAND HERE AND SAY THIS

1266
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
OCCURRED.

1267
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
WE WILL AND WE ARE SEARCHING

1268
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
DILIGENTLY AND NONSTOP TO ANSWER

1269
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
THAT QUESTION.

1270
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
THE TIME SHRINE BEING

1271
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
ESTABLISHED BY INVESTIGATORS.

1272
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THAT IS THE BEST I CAN DO WITH

1273
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
THAT.

1274
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
GO AHEAD.

1275
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

1276
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE

1277
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS TO DO

1278
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
WHAT IS BEST.

1279
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EMOTIONAL

1280
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
TIME.

1281
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THE PLAN RIGHT NOW IS STILL UP

1282
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
IN THE AIR.

1283
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
THEY ARE FINALIZE GO THE PLANS

1284
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
AND WE'LL GET THAT INFORMATION

1285
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

1286
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
AS I SAID IT'S STILL TO BE

1287
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
DETERMINED.

1288
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
>> DO WE KNOW HOW MANY SHOTS

1289
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
WERE FIRED?

1290
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
>> THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.

1291
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
WE DO KNOW HOW MANY ROUNDS WE

1292
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
RECOVERED.
WE DO KNOW HOW MANY SHELL

1293
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
CASINGS WE RECOVERED BUT I DON'T

1294
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO GIVE

1295
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
OUT.

1296
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I WOULD BE SPECULATING AND

1297
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
GUESSING.
>> HOW MANY MAGAZINES?

1298
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
>> AGAIN THAT IS INFORMATION

1299
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THAT I'M NOT PRIVY TO.

1300
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I DON'T HAVE THAT TO GIVE YOU.

1301
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
MANY, MANY, HUNDREDS.

1302
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
YES, SIR, CORRECT.

1303
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
SIR?

1304
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

1305
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
THE QUESTION IS HE IS COMING TO

1306
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN, THE

1307
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

1308
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T DISCUSS SECURITY

1309
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1310
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
STATES.
SUFFICE IT TO SAY SIGNIFICANT

1311
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
SECURITY WILL BE IN PLACE.

1312
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
NO, SIR.

1313
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
NO TIME FRAME HAS BEEN

1314
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
DETERMINED.

1315
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
>> ARE YOU MAKING PROGRESS IN

1316
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
DETERMINING....

1317
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
>> WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE WORK

1318
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
THAT WE'RE MAKING.

1319
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS

1320
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
WE'RE MAKING.

1321
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
THIS TEED US ON PROCESS, IT WILL

1322
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
TAKE MANY, MANY MAN-HOURS TO PUT

1323
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
THIS PICTURE TOGETHER.

1324
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
THE MINUTE WE HAVE IT, OUR

1325
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

1326
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

1327
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION AS

1328
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

1329
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
WE HAVE A MOTIVE OR MOTIVE WE

1330
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
ARE PREPARED TO DISCUSS, THAT

1331
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
CANNOT HAPPEN.

1332
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT.

1333
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I WOULD AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO

1334
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
DISCUSS THE CRIME SCENE AT ALL.

1335
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
WE DID SEIZE A GREAT DEAL OF

1336
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
EVIDENCE.
OUR DETECTIVES HAVE EXECUTED

1337
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
NUMEROUS SEARCH WARRANTS IN THIS

1338
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
CASE.
WE DO NOT DETAIL THE C OF

1339
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
WHAT WE SEIZE IN ANY CRIMINAL

1340
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000

1342
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
DEAL OF INFORMATION.

1343
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
ALL THAT EVIDENCE NEEDS TO BE

1344
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
ANALYZED AND IT WILL BE WHETHER

1345
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
IN OUR FORENSIC LABORATORY OR

1346
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
SPECIALISTS AS TIME GOES ON.

1347
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
WE ANTICIPATE THIS IS GOING TO

1348
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
BE THE LAST DISCUSSION TODAY.

1349
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT COMING IN WE

1350
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
HAVE A GREAT DEAL ON OUR PLATE.

1351
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
IF ANYTHING ADDITIONAL SHOULD

1352
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
SURFACE WE WILL POST IT ON THE

1353
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
STATE POLICE WEBSITE BUT WE DO

1354
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
NOT ANTICIPATE ANYTHING THAT

1355
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
SHOULD ARISE.

1356
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
IF IT ARISES, CHECK ON OUR

1357
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
WEBSITE ON A REGULAR BASIS.

00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
