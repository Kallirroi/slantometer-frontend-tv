BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS ENORMOUS

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
TRAGEDY.
NO WORDS CAN TRULY EXPRESS HOW

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
HEARTBROKEN WE ARE.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
HE IS THE FATHER OF ADAM LANZA.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM FROM

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
HE IS NOW 20 YEARS OLD WHO

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
POLICE SAY WALKED INTO AN

INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL, THEY'RE

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THE SHOOTER KILLED HIMSELF.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
THIS IS WHERE POLICE ARE TRYING
TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THE

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
QUESTIONS WHY.
THE LANZA HOME, NOT FAR FROM THE

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
SCHOOL.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
IT'S ALSO WHERE THE SUSPECTED
SHOOTER'S MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AS WELL.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
TODAY, THE FATHER AND AUNT OF

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTING VICTIMS IN

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WENT

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
BEFORE CAMERAS TO REMEMBER A

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
CHILD THEY DESCRIBED AS

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
INCREDIBLE BUT IN REMEMBERING

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
LITTLE EMILIE PARKER, THEY SAID,

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
THEY'RE PRAYING FOR THE

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY, TOO, BECAUSE

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE
WANTED.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
KYUNG LAH WAS THERE.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
KYUNG, WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
MOST OF ALL WHEN YOU WERE

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE AND YOU
WATCHED ALL OF THIS?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
>> THE ABILITY OF THEM TO BE

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
ABLE TO STILL THINK OF OTHER

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
PEOPLE AND SOCIETY IN THE FACE

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
OF AN UNSPEAKABLE LOSS.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
IF YOU'RE A PARENT, IF YOU HAVE

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
CHILDREN WHO YOU LOVE AND YOU

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THINK ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
YOURSELF, IT'S REALLY HARD TO

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
COMPREHEND, THEN BEING ABLE TO

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
FACE NATIONAL CAMERAS, REPORTERS

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
AND MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SOCIETY.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY HAS

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
DONE.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THEY SAID.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
>> EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TWO LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IN TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ,

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
DANCE AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS
IN LIFE.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
>> EMILIE ALICE PARKER WAS THE

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL I'VE EVER

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
KNOWN.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
MY CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
MY SIBLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
ARE GRIEVING AND WE'RE JUST

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
DEVASTATED THAT SOMEONE SO

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT IS NO
LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR LIVES

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
>> AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SO MANY PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
PEOPLE.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> WHAT HE SAID IS THAT HE

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SIMPLY WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TO BECOME MORE TOLERANT, TO BE

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
MORE HUMANE.

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
HE IS HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TO BE AN EVENT WHERE PEOPLE LOOK

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
NOT AT THE SHOOTER, NOT AT THE
CRIME ITSELF BUT IN TRYING TO

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BECOME BETTER PEOPLE FOR THE

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
GREATER GOOD OF SOCIETY.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
IT'S REALLY, TRULY REMARKABLE,

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THIS FATHER CAME HERE EIGHT

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
MONTHS AGO WITH HIS FAMILY TO

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THIS SMALL COMMUNITY TO TAKE A

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
JOB AT A NEONATAL SECTION OF THE
LOCAL HOSPITAL HERE.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
HE'S HERE TO TRY TO HELP

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CHILDREN GET BETTER AND YET HIS

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
CHILD WAS LOST DUE TO GUN
VIOLENCE.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IN THE FACE OF UNSPEAKABLE LOSS,

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
DON, FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO STEP

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
ISSUES REALLY IS SIMPLY

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
STUNNING.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
>> SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY IN

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THAT PHOTO AND REALLY SUCH A

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
COMPOSED MAN CONSIDERING WHAT

HAPPENED.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
KYUNG LAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT VICTORIA

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
SOTO, SHE ADORED HER STUDENTS
CALLING THEM HER KIDS.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED, SHE

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
DID WHAT SHE COULD TO PROTECT

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THEM.

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000

WORE GREEN.

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THE 27-YEAR-OLD'S FAVORITE

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
COLOR.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
CNN'S JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
HOW IS THIS COMMUNITY DEALING

WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
RIGHT NOW?

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
>> THEY'RE JUST COMPLETELY TORN

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
UP.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT,

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TO SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HUNDREDS WHO CAME OUT HERE AT

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
STRATFORD HIGH SCHOOL.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THIS IS WHERE VICTORIA, VICKI AS

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
EVERYONE CALLED HER, VICKI SOTO,

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THIS IS WHERE SHE GRADUATED BACK
IN 2003.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WHEN EVERYONE GOT TOGETHER HERE

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
TONIGHT, THEY DID THEIR BEST TO

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
REMEMBER HER.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW SOTO

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A TEACHER,

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE
GIRL.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO BE A

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TEACHER, THAT'S WHAT HER FRIENDS

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SAID.

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
TONIGHT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
HEROIC ACTIONS THAT SHE TOOK IN

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
HER CLASSROOM WHEN THE GUNMAN

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR, HOW SHE

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
RUSHED THE KIDS INTO A CLOSET TO

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TRY AND SAVE THEM AND THEN OF

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
COURSE THE GUNMAN TOOK HER LIFE.

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AS WE WERE OUT HERE TONIGHT WITH

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
HER SISTERS AND HER BROTHER, HER

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
COUSINS AND ALL OF HER FRIENDS,

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
REMEMBER HER, I SPOKE TO ONE

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
YOUNG WOMAN, A FRIEND OF SOTO'S

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
JUST LISTEN TO HOW SHE STRUGGLED

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WILL
REMEMBER HER.

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
SMILING.

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT
SHE WENT THROUGH.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
HEAVEN.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
>> DON, THE REASON WHY SOTO'S

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
FAMILY DECIDED TO HOLD THIS

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
VIGIL TONIGHT, THE REASON WHY

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THEY SHOWED UP AND GAVE US

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PICTURES, PICTURES BY THE WAY

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THAT SOTO'S MOTHER PICKED OUT

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BECAUSE THEY WERE HER FAVORITE

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PICTURES.
THE REASON WHY THEY DID ALL THIS

196
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT

197
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SOTO TO BE REMEMBERED AS JUST A

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
VICTIM.

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THEY WANTED HER TO BE REMEMBERED

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AS A DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DAUGHTER, A LOVING SISTER.

202
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
AT ONE POINT HER SISTER, CARLEY,

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SHE STOOD UP AND SPOKE TO

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT HERE TODAY

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AND SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT SHE

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
HAD TWEETED EARLIER TODAY.

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SHE SAID, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES,

208
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WILL EVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THESE WERE THE WORDS SPOKEN BY

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HER YOUNGER SISTER, 19-YEAR-OLD

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
CARLEY.

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THIS IS HOW THEY WANT HER
REMEMBERED.

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
DON?

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
>> JASON, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THESE ARE NOT JUST VICTIMS.

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
HAVE LED EXTRAORDINARY LIVES AND

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
TAKEN AWAY WAY TOO SOON.

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
JASON CARROLL, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.

222
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WITNESSES SAY THE FIRST SHOTS

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
RANG OUT YESTERDAY JUST AFTER

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BEING READ AT SANDY HOOK
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

226
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
POLICE ARE TRYING TO HAMMER DOWN

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

228
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THAT MOMENT.

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
AND OUR TOM FOREMAN HAS A

230
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
BREAKDOWN ON WHAT INVESTIGATORS
KNOW SO FAR.

231
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
>> POLICE ARE SEARCHING OVER AN

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
IMMENSE AREA FOR ANY CLUE WHY

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THIS HAPPENED.
THEY'VE SEARCHED THE BROTHER'S

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
JERSEY.
THEY BELIEVE THE GUNMAN WENT

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
DIRECTLY HERE AFTER HIS MOTHER'S

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
MURDER AND EMERGED FROM HIS CAR

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
IN THE PARKING LOT CARRYING

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
WEAPONS VERY MUCH LIKE THESE.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE
BASED ON POLICE RADIO REPORTS

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
AND EYEWITNESSES.

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT'S WHEN

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WE BELIEVE THAT HE EMERGED FROM

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
HIS CAR AND HEADED INTO THE

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
SCHOOL HERE.

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS HIS

248
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CAR.
BUT THEY'VE PAID A LOT OF

249
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ATTENTION TO THIS VEHICLE OVER

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HERE IS WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED HIS

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
FIRST BARRICADE BECAUSE THERE

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WAS A SECURITY SYSTEM ON THE

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
DOORS THERE RECENTLY PUT IN BY

255
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE HE WOULD

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

257
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
POLICE LATER FOUND THAT THE

258
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
GLASS HERE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OR
BROKEN OUT IN SOME FASHION.

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE ENTERED

260
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THE SCHOOL.

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

262
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
WELL, THE FIRST CALL TO THE

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
POLICE THAT SAID THERE WAS A
PROBLEM CAME AT 9:36.

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THE FIRST CALL SAYING THERE IS

265
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
GUNFIRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
KNEW IT BECAUSE THEY COULD

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
EITHER HEAR IT DIRECTLY OR

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT OVER THE

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
SCHOOL'S P.A. SYSTEM, THERE WERE

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE AT THE
TIME.

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ALL THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN A
A VERY SMALL AREA UP IN THIS

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL.

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ELSE HAVE SOME IDEA THAT THIS

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WAS GOING ON SO THEY COULD TRY
TO BE SAFE IN THESE

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

278
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
BEYOND THAT, WHAT HAPPENED?

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AT 9:38, POLICE WERE SAYING

280
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
ALREADY THEY WERE HEARING

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
REPORTS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OVER.

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TIME.

285
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
2, 2 1/2 MINUTES, MAYBE, WHERE

286
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE BULK, IF NOT ALL OF THE

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.
WHAT WAS THE NEXT PHASE OF ALL

288
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
OF THIS?

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THE NEXT PHASE CAME WHEN AT

290
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
ABOUT 9:40, POLICE AT THE SCHOOL

291
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SAID, WE NEED SOME EMERGENCY

292
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
MEDICAL SERVICES HERE.

293
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL FOR

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AMBULANCES.

295
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
IT WAS FOR TWO AMBULANCES TO

296
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS THEY

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
REALIZED THEY HAD MANY MORE
VICTIMS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THERE WAS A CALL FOR MANY, MANY

299
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MORE EMERGENCY MEDICAL

300
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
TECHNICIANS AND AMBULANCES TO

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
COME TO THE SCHOOL.

302
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AND THEN SURPRISINGLY, BY 9:50

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IN THE MORNING, POLICE WERE

304
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT THEY HAD

305
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN, MEANING

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THEY HAD HAD ONE SUSPECT WHO IS

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
DEAD, THEY HAD SECURED THE

308
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BUILDING TO SOME DEGREE.

309
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THEY'D CLEARED THE BUILDING IS

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE LANGUAGE THEY USED.

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AND A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE BEING

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
LED AWAY.

313
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM "THE

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
NEWTOWN BEE" OF THE KIDS BEING

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
LED AWAY.

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THIS IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
TIME, FROM 17 TO 20 MINUTES THAT

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THIS WENT FROM NOTHING HAPPENING

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
TO ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPENING

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SO MANY PEOPLE.

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
AND POLICE WILL CONTINUE GOING

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THIS

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SHOOTER AND HIS VICTIMS TO TRY

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

327
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
PRECISELY HOW IT ALL HAPPENED.

328
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> TOM, THANKS.

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BUILDING

330
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AFFECTED EVERYONE.

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE TRAGEDY IS TOUGH FOR THE

332
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
ENTIRE COMMUNITY HERE.

333
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
AND THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED
STILL WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH TWO WOMEN

335
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
TRYING TO DO JUST THAT.

336
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
WHEN YOU CAME UP TO TALK TO ME,

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
YOU LADIES COULD BARELY GET THE

338
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WORDS OUT.

339
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
>> THIS IS -- THERE ARE NO

340
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WORDS.

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
AND EVEN RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT

343
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
FAMILIES ARE CRYING TOGETHER,

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TRYING TO GET THROUGH DAY TO

345
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
DAY.

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
AND WE FEEL THAT SINCE WE

347
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WEREN'T DIRECTLY IMPACTED, WE

348
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
USE OUR VOICES TO SAY THINGS

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THAT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
GOING TO BE SAYING FOR A LONG

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
TIME AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE.

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S AFTER THE

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CAMERAS ARE GONE THAT THINGS

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
STOP WORKING.

356
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
AND MOTION STOPS.

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> FOR YOU, YOU'VE BEEN CRYING

358
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE STANDING
HERE.

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE WORDS TO

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE

362
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
AND HOW CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
AUNTS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE FAR

365
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
AWAY WHO JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
HERE, THERE ARE NO WORDS.

367
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
AND THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE

368
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
ANYWHERE.

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WE NEED TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN DO

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000

I WANT SOMEONE TO GIVE US AN

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO
SCHOOL?

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THEM THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING

SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE THEM

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
FEEL SAFE.

389
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
>> HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?

390
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS 11 AND MY SON

391
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000

>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SCHOOL?

>> IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE,

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

396
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000

EVERY PARENT?

403
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
>> YEAH.

00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE KIND

405
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
OF COVERAGE THAT YOU'RE --

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
YOU'VE BEEN VERY SENSITIVE.

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> THOSE WOMEN DIDN'T WANT THEIR

408
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
FACES ON CAMERA.

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THEY SAID WE COULD SHOOT THEM

410
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
FROM THE SIDE BECAUSE THEY HAD

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
BEEN CRYING ALL DAY.

412
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
THE REASON THEY CAME HERE, THEY

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SAID THEY WERE WATCHING THE
BROADCAST EARLIER AND I ASKED,

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO YOUR

415
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
CHILDREN, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT?

416
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
AND THIS IS THE NOTE THAT THEY

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WROTE TO ME BEFORE THEY WALKED

418
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
AWAY.

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I SAID, PLEASE LET ME PUT IT ON
CAMERA.

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THEY SAID, EARLIER YOU ASKED

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
SOMEONE BEING INTERVIEWED WHAT

422
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
WE WOULD WANT OUR COUNTRY TO DO

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

424
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE.

425
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
RIGHT AWAY, WE NEED SPECIFIC

426
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
PLANS AND ACTIONS TO IMPROVE

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

428
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
SCHOOLS BEFORE THEY'RE EXPECTED

429
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
WE FEEL WE COULD BETTER ENSURE

431
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY BY PLACING

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A PERMANENT OFFICER IN EACH OF

433
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
OUR SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN SO THEY

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WILL KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS THERE

435
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
THEIR SCHOOL AND THEN THEY WENT

437
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ON SAYING WHAT ELSE THEY WOULD
LIKE.

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
BASICALLY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN

439
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
THEY GO TO SCHOOL.

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THEY SAID THEIR KIDS ARE ASKING

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THEM QUESTIONS THAT THEY CAN'T

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
ANSWER AND THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO

443
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE COMING
WEEKS.

444
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A LOT OF PARENTS REALLY ARE
ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT

445
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
NOW.

446
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

447
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
GET THEM ON, PUT THEM ON CAMERA

448
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
AND LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD.

449
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
TONIGHT, A LOT OF PARENTS

450
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WATCHING THESE EVENTS AT HOME,

451
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
WHILE THEIR HEARTS ACHE FOR

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY HAVE TO BE

453
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WORRIED, THEY HAVE TO BE
WORRIED.

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?

455
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SCHOOL

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SAFETY IN A MOMENT.

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
ALSO A YOUNG MAN WHO RAN TO THE

458
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
SCHOOL WHEN HE HEARD THE SHOTS.

459
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
HIS STORY IS NEXT.

460
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
[ Woman ] DEAR CAT, YOUR HAIR
MIXES WITH POLLEN AND DUST.

461
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000

TOMORROW WILL NO DOUBT BE
ANOTHER EMOTIONAL DAY HERE.

472
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THE PRESIDENT IS COMING TO MEET

473
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE ATTEND AN

475

INTERFAITH VIGIL SCHEDULED FOR

476
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER RELEASED A

477
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
STATEMENT TONIGHT.
THE FATHER'S NAME IS PETER

478
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
LANZA.

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
HE SAYS, WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
HIS FAMILY'S HEARTBREAK.

481
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
HE SAYS THE FAMILY IS IN WHAT HE

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
CALLS A STATE OF DISBELIEF.

483
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SIX WOMEN, 20 CHILDREN DIED AT

484
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

485
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
THAT NUMBER INCLUDES 12 GIRLS

486
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
AND EIGHT BOYS.
16 OF THE KIDS WERE ONLY 6 YEARS

487
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
OLD.

488
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
THE OTHERS HAD TURNED 7 IN JUST

489
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

490
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I WANT TO BRING IN NOW A STUDENT

491
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
AT NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL.

492
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
HE JOINS ME NOW

493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
YOU ACTUALLY RAN INTO THE SCHOOL

494
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WHEN YOU HEARD THE SHOTS.

495
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
YOU STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL THAT

496
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
DAY BY HAPPENSTANCE.

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
YOU RAN INTO THE SCHOOL.
WHAT HAPPENED?

498
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> I DID NOT ACTUALLY RUN INTO

499
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THE SCHOOL BUT I WAS VERY CLOSE

500
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
TO THE PERIMETER OF THE SCHOOL

501
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
AND THAT'S WHERE -- AS SOON AS I

502
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
ENTERED THE DRIVEWAY OF THE

503
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
SCHOOL, WE SAW A LOT OF POLI

504
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
CARS THERE.

505
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
>> YOU WERE AT HOME.

506
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
DID YOU HEAR SHOTS?

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WHAT DID YOU --

508
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR CALLED US

509
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
CLAIMING SHE HEARD SHOTS.

510
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE HEARD A LOT

511
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
OF SIRENS GOING OFF.

512
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT VERY

513
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
CONCERNED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DID

514
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL.

515
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THEY DID NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

516
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THAT WAS WHEN WE REALLY BECAME

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
CONCERNED.

518
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, YOU SAID
YOU GOT TO THE PERIMETER OF THE

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SCHOOL.
>> RIGHT.

520
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, THEN

521
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
WHAT?

522
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
>> THEN IT WAS JUST HORRIFYING.

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WITHIN A MATTER OF THREE

524
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
MINUTES, WE SAW TWO STUDENTS

525
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
BEING CARRIED OUT BY STATE
TROOPERS.

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THEY WERE NOT MOVING.

527
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
THEY WERE VERY PALE AND IT WAS

528
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
JUST A VERY HORRIFYING SCENE.

529
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AND THEN A THIRD FEMALE CAME

530
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OUT.

531
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
SHE HAD A LOT OF BLOOD OVER HER

532
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
FACE.

533
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE.

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
IT WAS BLOOD SPLATTER FROM OTHER

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
STUDENTS WAS MY GUESS BECAUSE

536
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
SHE WAS WALKING FINE.

537
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
>> THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

538
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, 5, 6, 7

539
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
YEARS OLD.

540
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>> YEAH, NO MORE THAN THAT.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

541
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
>> DID YOU FEEL HELPLESS IN NOT

542
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING?

543
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S THE

544
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE IT.

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
HELPLESS.

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I WAS WAITING FOR MY SISTER.

547
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
IT WAS 20 MINUTES BETWEEN THE

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
TIME I SAW THOSE OTHER

549
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
FEMALES --

550
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> YOUR SISTER GOES TO THE

551
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
SCHOOL?
>> YES, SHE DOES.

552
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW --

553
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

554
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
HAPPENING TO HER.

555
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
>> YOUR SISTER IS 7?

556
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> SHE'S 9.

557
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
>> SHE'S 9?
>> CORRECT.

558
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
>> NOT KNOWING IN THOSE
MOMENTS --

559
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

560
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY

561
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
HEAD, ALL MY MEMORIES WITH HER

562
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

563
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
DURING THOSE 20 MINUTES.
IT SEEMED LIKE DAYS.

564
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
BUT IT WAS HORRIFYING.

565
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
>> WHEN DID SHE COME OUT?
>> SHE CAME OUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES

566
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
AFTER THE -- I SAW THE OTHER

567
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
STUDENTS -- THE TWO OTHER

568
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
STUDENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE

569
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD LATER ON.

570
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
AND THE STUDENTS -- ALL THE

571
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
STUDENTS WERE CRYING AND

572
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
SOBBING.

573
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND THEY WERE JUST -- THEY WERE
TRAUMATIZED.

574
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
>> HOW'S YOUR SISTER DOING?

575
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
>> SHE'S DOING WELL.

576
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
AGAIN, SHE'S VERY TRAUMATIZED

577
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
NATURALLY.

578
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
BUT I CREDIT THE TEACHERS FOR

579
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
KEEPING THEM CALM.

580
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THEY'RE VERY HEROIC TEACHERS

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
THAT DAY.

582
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THERE WERE

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
MULTIPLE TEACHERS THAT DID A
FANTASTIC JOB KEEPING THE

584
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
CHILDREN CALM.

585
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR SISTER SAY?

586
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING --

587
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
>> YEAH.

588
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
THE FIRST THING SHE TOLD ME WAS

589
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE INTERCOM

590
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
SYSTEM COME ON AND THROUGH THE

591
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
INTERCOM, SHE HEARD SCREAMS AND
BULLETS -- SHE HEARD THE

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
GUNSHOTS AND THE SCREAMS

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
OCCURRING IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF
THE BUILDING.

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHEN THE

595
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
SCHOOL WENT INTO LOCKDOWN.

596
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> A 9-YEAR-OLD.

597
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE A 9-YEAR-OLD

598
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT?

599
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I JUST CAN'T.

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
>> IT'S TRAUMATIC.

601
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
>> TELL US -- TALK TO OUR

602
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
VIEWERS AND EVERYONE WHO'S
WATCHING HERE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS

603
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
ARE DOING, YOUR SISTER, YOUR

604
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY?

605
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
>> FIRST OFF, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE

607
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
WHO'S SUFFERING FROM THIS,

608
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, IT'S AN

609
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY.

610
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

611
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
IN NEWTOWN.

612
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
CULTURALLY WE'RE A VERY, VERY

613
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
STRONG TOWN.

614
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AND WE STICK TOGETHER.

615
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
WE'RE A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

616
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK
THROUGH THIS.

617
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
EVERYONE CARES ABOUT EVERYONE.

618
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
AND THAT'S JUST WHO WE ARE.
THAT'S OUR CULTURE.

619
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> YOU'RE 17?

620
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> YES.

621
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
>> THE SHOOTER IS 20.
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>> NO.

623
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
BUT UPON HEARING HE WAS 20, I

624
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WAS SHOCKED.

625
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I WAS LOST FOR WORDS.

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
HOW COULD SOMEONE SO YOUNG

627
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
COMMIT SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

628
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FAMILY?

629
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
>> I DO NOT.
I DO NOT.

630
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

631
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> WE'RE GLAD YOUR SISTER IS

632
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
OKAY.

633
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
AGAIN, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

634
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
ARE WITH EVERYONE HERE.

635
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> APPRECIATE IT.

636
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING JUST TO

637
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
WATCH THIS COMMUNITY IN THE

638
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
COMING DAYS TRY TO DEAL WITH

639
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
THIS, TO SEE HOW THEY'RE GOING

640
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
TO COPE, HOW THE WORLD IS GOING

641
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
TO TRY TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH

642
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
IT, WHAT WORDS OF COMFORT THE

643
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PRESIDENT WILL OFFER THEM AS

644
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WELL.

645
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
WE'LL BE HERE TO COVER IT FOR

646
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
YOU HERE ON CNN.

647
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I TOOK A
WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN, THIS

648
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
TOWN OF JUST 27,000 PEOPLE, ALL

649
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OF THEM STILL TRYING TO PROCESS

650
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED JUST

651
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
DOWN THE ROAD.

652
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE ROAD

653
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SCHOOL

654
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
WHERE THIS HAPPENED.

655
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.

656
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE RIGHT

657
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ACROSS THE STREET ON THAT PORCH,

658
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
IT SAYS, GOD BLESS SANDY HOOK.

659
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THAT JUST ABOUT SAYS IT ALL

660
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
AND RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

661
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THE SQUARE, 26 CANDLES FOR ALL
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS TRAGEDY

662
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME SQUARE.

663
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AND UP THE STREET, A CHURCH
WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE BEING

664
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
MEMORIALIZED.

665
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE INTIMATE

666
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
LITTLE SQUARES HERE IN SANDY

667
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
HOOK.

668
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE QUAINT

669
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
STORES, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STORES.

670
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND THEN COME THIS WAY, YOU CAN

671
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
SEE JUST THE MEDIA.

672
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
SQUARE OVER.

674
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE HERE, THEY

675
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SAY, THERE'S NEVER THIS MANY
PEOPLE.

676
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THERE ARE NEVER THIS MANY PEOPLE

677
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
WHO COME TO THIS TOWN ON A
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
TO SEE HOW INTIMATE AND

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
BEAUTIFUL THIS TOWN IS, LOOK, A

680
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
CREEK THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH

681
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
IT.

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS SMALL TOWN

683
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
PROBABLY NEVER DREAMED THAT

684
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THEIR TOWN WOULD BE THE FOCUS OF

685
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
SUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH AND
SORROW.

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THIS IS THE NEWTOWN UNITED

687
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
METHODIST CHURCH AND WHERE A LOT

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
OF THE MEDIA ARE CAMPED OUT.

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THEY GIVE PRESCHOOL CLASSES,

690
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
AGES TWO TO SIX, SADLY SOME OF

691
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THOSE KIDS HAVE DIED

692
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THERE'S THE CHURCH BEHIND ME.

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
IT'S BEEN OPENED NOW FOR 24
HOURS.

694
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN 24 HOURS

695
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED IT

696
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
HERE.
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT

697
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
CHURCH DIED AND ANYONE WHO WANTS
TO COME BY AND PAY THEIR

698
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
RESPECTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DIED,

699
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP FROM THIS
CHURCH, THEY CAN COME HERE AND

700
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
GET IT.

701
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
AFTER THIS SHOOTING INSIDE SANDY

702
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
SAFETY ISSUE WILL NOW BE FRONT

704
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
AND CENTER AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.

705
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
DO CLASSROOMS NEED TO BE CHANGED

706
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
INTO PANIC ROOMS OR AS I'VE BEEN

707
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
SAYING EARLIER, CAN WE MAKE

708
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
CLASSROOMS INTO MINI PRISONS?

709
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE MAY HAVE

710
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO
BE SAFE.

711
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I WANT TO BRING IN LOU PALUMBO.

712
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HE IS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER

713
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
AND NOW THE DIRECTOR OF A LEAD

714
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
INTELLIGENCE BASED SECURITY FIRM

715
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
SOME SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE
ROAMING OFFICERS, METAL

716
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
DETECTORS, OFFICERS ROAMING THE

717
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
HALLWAYS.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR

718
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
SCHOOLS SAFER?
DO WE NEED ALL OF THESE MEASURES

719
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
IN PLACE?

720
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
>> WELL, APPARENTLY BASED ON

721
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THIS INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE UP

722
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HERE YESTERDAY, I GUESS YOU

723
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
COULD SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT.

724
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE TO THINK

725
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

726
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
CREATE ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR

727
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
CHILDREN TO LEARN IN THAT ARE A

728
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
BIT MORE SECURE.

729
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
AND I DON'T THINK MY

730
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANYTHING

731
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THAT ARE EXTREME.

732
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, DON,

733
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
ONE THING I WOULD DO IS LOCK
THESE CLASSROOM DOORS.

734
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I WOULD CHANGE THE DOORS AND

735
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
FORTIFY THE LOCKS AND UPGRADE

736
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
THEM.

737
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE SAME ON ENTERING THE
BUILDING.

738
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THERE'S A CONDITION WHAT WE CALL
A MANTRAP.

739
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU ENTER FROM AN

740
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
OUTER DOOR INTO A TYPE OF FOYER

741
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
AREA WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER DOOR

742
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND THAT DOOR IS SECURED UNTIL

743
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO YOU

744
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ARE.

745
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF

746
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THINGS THEY CAN IMPLEMENT

747
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS

748
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE NOT JUST

749
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
IMPACTING OUR EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS BUT OUR ENTIRE

750
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
COUNTRY.
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR SAFETY,

751
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
OUR PEACE OF MIND.

752
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
OUR FEELING OF HOW SECURE WE

753
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
REALLY ARE

754
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A

755
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
CHANCE TO HEAR THE TWO MOTHERS

756
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THATCAME UP AND WROTE ME THE
LETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY TO

757
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THEIR KIDS.
THEY SAY, OUR KIDS ARE ASKING

758
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

759
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.
THEY'RE ASKING US ABOUT GOING

760
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY.

761
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
HOW DO YOU REASSURE PARENTS AND
EVEN STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SAFE

762
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AT SCHOOL?
CAN YOU REASSURE THEM?

763
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT?

764
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
>> APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT.
WHAT I WOULD DO IN THE

765
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD IN
PARTICULAR FOR THESE CHILDREN UP

766
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
HERE, I WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF
UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE

767
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
TO EASE THEM THROUGH A

768
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
TRANSITION OF COMFORT AGAIN TO

769
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WHERE THEY CAN START TO RELAX

770
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AND FEEL A BIT MORE SECURE AND A

771
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
BIT MORE SAFE.

772
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
AND WATCHED OVER, SO TO SPEAK

773
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I DON'T THINK THE GRAVITY OF

774
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THIS SITUATION FOR ALL OF US HAS

775
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
SET IN YET, NOT IN THIS
COMMUNITY AND NOT IN THIS

776
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
NATION.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY HAVE

777
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WHAT THE

778
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
ANGUISH WAS FOR THESE BABIES IN

779
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
THAT CLASSROOM.

780
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO EVEN
SPEAK ABOUT IT.

781
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
>> THAT THIS HAPPENS -- I SAID

782
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
AMAZING EARLIER, AND THE

783
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
PERPLEXING SENSE OF THAT WORD

784
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
THAT EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT
THIS, WE SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

785
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
COMMUNITY'S RESILIENT.

786
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THEY'LL GET THROUGH IT.
WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO SAY

787
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
THAT.

788
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

789
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE BURYING
CHILDREN AT THIS AGE.

790
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
IT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF A MUCH

791
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
LARGER PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY.

792
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
>> I WENT ON THE AIR I THINK IT

793
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
WAS ABOUT 11:40 ON FRIDAY AND I
WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SAFETY

794
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
AND SECURITY.

795
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AND I SAID, LOU, YOU SEND YOUR

796
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL AND THIS IS

797
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THE WORST PHONE CALL THAT YOU

798
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
CAN GET.

799
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
THEN WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS

800
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
JUST SOME ANGRY PARENT OR

801
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
SOMEONE WHO HAD JUST COME IN AND

802
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON

803
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
INVOLVED.
AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, WE FIND

804
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
OUT IT'S 20 CHILDREN INVOLVED IN

805
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
THIS SHOOTING.

806
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.

807
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH

808
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

809
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.

810
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
>> WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS

811
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
INTERPRETATION WE HAVE OF THE
CONSTITUTION.

812
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
AND I WOULD SAY INTERJECT SOME

813
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
LEVEL OF COMMON SENSE, DECENCY

814
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
AND SENSIBILITY.

815
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
NO ONE'S OPPOSED TO IS SECOND
AMENDMENT.

816
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'M CERTAINLY NOT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.

817
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE SEE US DO

818
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THIS -- THEY SAY, NO ONE'S
TRYING TO DO THAT.

819
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF.

820
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS,

821
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
LOU.

822
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
WE DON'T COVER MULTIPLE

823
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
STABBINGS WHERE 20 PEOPLE -- 26

824
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
PEOPLE DIE IN A SCHOOL.

825
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
WE DON'T COVER WHERE MOLOTOV

826
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
COCKTAIL GOES OFF IN THE SCHOOL

827
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

828
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
IT'S USUALLY FROM SOMEONE WITH

829
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
SOME TYPE OF ASSAULT WEAPON AND

830
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SICK MIND WHO
GOES IN AND DOES THESE SORTS OF

831
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THINGS.

832
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
>> THE REAL UNFORTUNATE PART IS

833
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
COUPLED WITH A SICK MIND OR

834
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
DERANGEMENT OR DELUSION, WE HAVE
A VEHICLE OF DELIVERY OF THEIR

835
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
MESSAGE.
THAT'S WHERE THE FIREARM COMES

836
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
IN.

837
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
WHAT WE SPOKE TO EARLIER IS

838
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
KNOWING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE

839
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
PEOPLE WE'RE PUTTING THESE
FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF.

840
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
TALKING ABOUT JUST SCREENING

841
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
PEOPLE PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

842
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
THIS IS NOT AN ANOMALY.

843
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
THIS IS BECOMING A PATTERN.

844
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO

845
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
STATISTICALLY ADDRESS THIS BY

846
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
SAYING THE NUMBER OF TIMES OR

847
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE

848
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
INCIDENTS IN DIRECT PROPORTION

849
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
TO OUR POPULATION ARE .5%.
THAT'S A GREAT STATISTIC UNLESS

850
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
IT'S YOUR CHILD.
BUT THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN DO

851
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THIS.
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

852
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF

853
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
THIS THING OUT AND SIT DOWN THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

854
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE ADDRESSING

855
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
THIS.

856
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
THIS IS A DISGUSTING PROBLEM

857
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH --

858
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
>> AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

859
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
THANK YOU.

860
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

861
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
>> AND AS YOU SAY, TAKE THE
POLITICS OUT OF IT.

862
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
IT'S A COMMONSENSE ISSUE, NOT A

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
LEFT/RIGHT ISSUE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

864
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
MOST OF US CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

865
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN.

866
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN BECAUSE THEY
HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE.

867
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
CNN'S JOSH LEVS TELLS US HOW

868
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
VICTIMS OF THE 1999 COLUMBINE

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SHOOTING ARE REACTING TO THIS
HORROR.

870
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
>> MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE WORLD ARE MOURNING FOR THE

871
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN

872
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
CONNECTICUT.
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN GROUP OF

873
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, A VERY

874
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
SMALL GROUP, FORTUNATELY, THAT
CAN ASSOCIATE IN A WAY THAT MOST

875
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
OF US CANNOT IMAGINE.

876
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT

877
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
IT'S LIKE TO BE AT SCHOOL WHEN A

878
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
TYPICAL DAY TURNS INTO CARNAGE.

879
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
SOME OF THEM ARE SURVIVORS OF

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE 14 YEARS

881
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
AGO, SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW

882
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
PARENTS THEMSELVES.

883
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I SPOKE WITH ONE WHO'S NOW A

884
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
MOM, CASEY JOHNSON.

885
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> YOU LOSE THE SENSE THAT

886
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THINGS COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO
YOU.

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SO MANY PARENTS WOULD SAY, THIS

888
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AT MY CHILD'S

889
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SCHOOL.

890
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
FOR ME AS A PARENT OF A CHILD, I

891
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
BELIEVE THIS COULD EASILY HAPPEN

892
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
AT MY CHILD'S SCHOOL BECAUSE

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED

894
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
TO ME BEFORE.

895
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE

896
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
INVOLVED WILL WALK BESIDE THESE

897
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES FOR
THE YEARS TO COME.

898
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THEY HAVE YEARS AND YEARS OF

899
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
HEALING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

900
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
FACING.

901
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME

902
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
BESIDE THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM

903
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
AND FOCUS POSITIVELY ON THE

904
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
LIVES OF THE ONES THAT WERE

905
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
LOST.

906
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
>> I WANT YOU TO MEET SHAWN
GRAVES.

907
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
SHAWN WAS SHOT SIX TIMES AT

908
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
COLUMBINE.
HE ENDED UP SPENDING MORE THAN A

909
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
YEAR IN A WHEELCHAIR.

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
TO THIS DAY, HE HAS SOME PAIN

911
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
BECAUSE OF IT.
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT HOW THE

912
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
NEWS FROM CONNECTICUT IS

913
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000

INJURIES THAT I SUSTAINED.

917
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
BUT LOOKING BACK THEN, I TRY NOT

918
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

919
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

HANDS OF HER TROUBLED SON.

949
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Music is a universal language.

950
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But when I was in an accident...

951
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I was worried the
health care system

952
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
spoke a language all its own

953
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

954
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000

Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

957
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So I never missed a beat.

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS

1089
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
US THAT HIS OLDER BROTHER SAYS

1090
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS

1091
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
AUTISTIC.

1092
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING ADDS UP TO A

1093
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MOTIVE.

1094
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN, NEWTOWN,

1095
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
CONNECTICUT.

1096
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER HAS

1097
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MORE

1098
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
MYSTERIOUS FIGURES IN THE
INVESTIGATION.

1099
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
HER SON APPARENTLY USED ONE OF

1100
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
HER OWN GUNS TO KILL HER.

1101
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE
DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER.

1102
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
CNN'S DAVID ARIOSTO JOINS US NOW

1103
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
WITH WHAT'S NEW ON THIS.

1104
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
DAVID, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

1105
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
NANCY LANZA?
>> RIGHT HERE, WE'RE HERE IN

1106
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
FRONT OF NANCY LANZA'S HOUSE.

1107
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN

1108
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THE ROAD.
WE'VE BEEN DIGGING ON THAT VERY

1109
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
QUESTION.

1110
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE AS TO
WHO THIS WOMAN REALLY WAS.

1111
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
WE SPOKE WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE
AREA HERE.

1112
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
MANY OF THEM HAVE RECALLED A

1113
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
PERSON WHO IS A VERY PLEASANT

1114
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
PERSON TO TALK WITH, LOVED

1115
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
GARDENING, LOVED LANDSCAPING.

1116
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
WOULD OFTEN ATTEND THESE SORT OF

1117
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
DICE GAME, LADIES NIGHT
GET-TOGETHERS EVERY SO OFTEN,

1118
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
PERHAPS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1119
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT

1120
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
SORT OF LEANED ON HER NEIGHBORS

1121
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
BUT WAS ONLY REALLY FAMILIAR

1122
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS IN

1123
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

1124
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
YOU KIND OF THINK OF YOUR OWN

1125
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW MANY

1126
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
NEIGHBORS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW

1127
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OUTSIDE THOSE INITIAL FEW

1128
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
BLOCKS.

1129
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
SO THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE DID GET

1130
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
TO SPEAK WITH DID GET TO KNOW

1131
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NANCY, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT ALL

1132
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THAT CLEAR WHAT WAS BEHIND THE

1133
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SCENES.

1134
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SHE MOVED HERE IN 1998 WITH HER

1135
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
HUSBAND.

1136
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THEY HAD TWO BOYS.

1137
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
SHE LATER DIVORCED AND RAISED

1138
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
HER TWO BOYS IN THIS AREA.

1139
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED LATER, HOWEVER,

1140
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
IS REALLY SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR

1141
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS OTHER SIDE

1142
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
TO NANCY.

1143
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
SHE HAD SEVERAL GUNS AND ONE

1144
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
INDIVIDUAL THAT I SPOKE TO, A

1145
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
BUSINESS OWNER, SAID THAT AT ONE

1146
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
POINT SHE EVEN BRANDISHED A
RIFLE THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY

1147
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
PURCHASED.

1148
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO SAID THAT

1149
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
SHE WOULD GO TARGET SHOOTING.

1150
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED

1151
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
AT A RANGE OR JUST AROUND ON

1152
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
CERTAIN TREES OR WHAT ACTUALLY

1153
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
HE MEANT BY THAT.

1154
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
BUT THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ATF
AND FBI OFFICIALS SAID

1155
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
ESSENTIALLY THAT WASN'T THE

1156
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
CASE.

1157
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
THEY WEREN'T AT A SHOOTING
RANGE.

1158
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THAT DIDN'T OCCUR.

1159
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
BUT REALLY WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

1160
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HERE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS

1161
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
TO IS JUST WHAT MOTIVATED HER

1162
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
SON TO DO THIS?

1163
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED INSIDE THE

1164
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
HOUSE -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF

1165
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PEOPLE REALLY REELING FROM THIS

1166
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
AND LEFT WITH THIS SORT OF A
SPEECHLESS QUALITY ABOUT IT,

1167
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
EVEN A DAY AFTER.

1168
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I KNOW MYSELF, I WENT DOWN TO

1169
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THE FIREHOUSE JUST YESTERDAY AS

1170
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
FAMILIES WERE COMING OUT OF THIS

1171
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
FIREHOUSE THAT WAS MEANT TO BE A

1172
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
WEIGH STATION.

1173
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
AND TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING

1174
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
HOURS OF THAT TUMULTUOUS DAY,

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
YOU'D SEE FAMILIES WALKING OUT

1176
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
WITH LOVED ONES, CHILDREN WHO

1177
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WERE TEARY-EYED, SHAKEN BUT

1178
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
CLEARLY THEY WERE WALKING OUT

1179
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1180
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
AND AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, THESE

1181
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
FAMILIES WOULD WALK OUT
CHILDLESS.

1182
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THESE

1183
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THINGS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

1184
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
AN EASY END EVEN AS THE DAYS --

1185
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> AND DAVID, CLEARLY IT BREAKS

1186
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
YOUR HEART.

1187
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
AS YOU SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF

1188
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1189
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL REPORTS

1190
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THAT SHE, NANCY LANZA,

1191
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ORIGINALLY WORKED FOR THE

1192
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
SCHOOL.

1193
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE, IS IT?

1194
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
>> A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING

1195
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
IN FROM ALL ANGLES HERE THAT WE

1196
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
GET IN.

1197
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
IT SEEMS CREDIBLE.

1198
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE

1199
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THE CASE.

1200
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL LOCAL

1201
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
REPORTS THAT INDICATED THAT SHE

1202
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN THE SCHOOL

1203
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
SYSTEM.

1204
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
WHAT WE LATER FOUND OUT IS THAT

1205
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SHE ACTUALLY HAD A BACKGROUND IN

1206
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
FINANCE AND HAD TAKEN SOME TIME
OFF AND WAS STAYING HERE.

1207
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WHAT HER CONNECTION WAS TO THE

1208
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
SCHOOL IS UNCLEAR.

1209
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
IF THERE'S ANY, WHICH ALSO

1210
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY

1211
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
HER SON CHOSE THIS SCHOOL TO GO

1212
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
IN AND COMMIT THIS HEINOUS ACT.

1213
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
>> DAVID ARIOSTO, THANK YOU VERY

1214
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING.

1215
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER HAD THREE

1216
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
GUNS WITH HIM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1217
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
THOSE GUNS WERE REGISTERED TO
HIS MOTHER.

1218
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT

1219
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THEM.

1220
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
SO CAN ANYONE BE HELD

1221
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEADLY
ATTACK?

1222
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
KAREN CONTI IS A TRIAL ATTORNEY
IN CHICAGO.

1223
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
CAN WE EXPECT LAWSUITS TO BE

1224
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
FILED AND AGAINST WHOM?

1225
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
>> LAWSUITS GET FILED FOR A LOT

1226
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
OF REASONS OTHER THAN MONEY
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MONEY DOESN'T

1227
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
REPLACE CHILDREN.

1228
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS TO

1229
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
GET INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN'T

1230
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
OTHERWISE GET THROUGH THE

1231
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
AUTHORITIES.
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1232
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
BLAME SOMEONE FOR AND HOLD
SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

1233
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
SENSELESS VIOLENCE.

1234
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1235
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
CHANGE THINGS IN THE FUTURE,

1236
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
MAYBE CHANGE THE LAWS AND THE

1237
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
SAFETY PROCEDURES.

1238
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
SO JUST A NOTE ABOUT THAT, THE

1239
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
PARENTS WHO ARE ANGRY AND UPSET

1240
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS WILL BRING

1241
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
LAWSUITS.
NOW, I JUST DON'T SEE A VIABLE

1242
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
LAWSUIT HERE BECAUSE WHO ARE YOU

1243
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
GOING TO SUE?

1244
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
THE SCHOOL SEEMED LIKE THEY DID

1245
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
A GREAT JOB, THEY HAD THE

1246
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
PRECAUTIONS IN PLACE.

1247
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THIS WAS AN ADULT PERSON WHO DID
THIS.

1248
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PARENTS

1249
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
RESPONSIBLE.

1250
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I DON'T REALLY SEE A VALID
LAWSUIT.

1251
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
>> YEAH.

1252
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION

1253
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
BECAUSE THE LEGAL DEFENSE HERE

1254
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE
SUSPECT IS OVER THE AGE OF 18.

1255
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
HE IS AN ADULT.

1256
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THEREFORE, HE'S THE ONLY ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS.

1257
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
BUT THEY WERE NOT HIS GUNS.

1258
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN

1259
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ACCESS TO THE GUNS.

1260
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
BUT THE PERSON THE GUNS BELONGED
TO IS NOW DECEASED.

1261
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1262
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
FAMILIES COULDN'T SUE THE ESTATE

1263
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
OF THE MOTHER.

1264
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

1265
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THAT SHE IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR

1266
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
FORM KNEW THAT HE HAD THE

1267
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
PROPENSITY TO DO THIS AND THIS

1268
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
INDIVIDUAL HAD ASPERGER'S

1269
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
SYNDROME, WHICH IS A FORM OF

1270
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
AUTISM.

1271
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
BUT IT HAS NO RELATION TO
VIOLENCE.

1272
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
BUT IF SHE HAD PRIOR

1273
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
KNOWLEDGE -- BUT EVEN THAT IS

1274
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
VERY TENUOUS.

1275
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
>> IN OREGON, WE SAW THE GUNS

1276
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
BEING STOLEN.

1277
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
WE SAW HERE THE GUNS BELONGED TO
THE MOTHER AND HE GOT ACCESS TO

1278
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THE GUNS.
CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME

1279
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
CHANGES IN THE LAW HERE BECAUSE

1280
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

1281
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN

1282
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
CONNECTICUT IS JUST PRIOR TO

1283
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THIS, AFTER THE AURORA,

1284
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
COLORADO, THEATER SHOOTING, THEY

1285
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
TRIED TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

1286
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE STRINGENT.

1287
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
BUT THERE WAS SUCH PROTEST THAT

1288
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
IT ALL GOT STRICKEN DOWN.

1289
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I DO SEE, THOUGH, THAT WE HAVE A
LAW IN ILLINOIS CALLED THE

1290
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
ILLINOIS SCHOOL SAFETY DRILL ACT

1291
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO

1292
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
ANNUALLY HAVE DRILLS TO KIND OF

1293
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
PREPARE FOR NOT ONLY THESE KINDS

1294
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
OF THINGS BUT WEATHER ISSUES,

1295
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
TORNADOES, FIRES AND THE LIKE,

1296
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
EVACUATION PROCEDURES IN PLACE,

1297
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
P.A. SYSTEMS, ET CETERA.

1298
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

1299
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION

1300
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY REQUIRING

1301
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SCHOOLS TO DO THIS.

1302
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
>> KAREN CONTI, THANK YOU.

1303
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
EARLIER ONE OF THE MOST

1304
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
COMPELLING MOMENTS OF THIS

1305
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
TRAGEDY, A FATHER WHO LOST HIS

1306
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
DAUGHTER IN THE SHOOTING,

1307
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
BRAVELY TELLS THE WORLD ABOUT

1308
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THE LITTLE GIRL THAT NOT ONLY HE

1309
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
LOST BUT ONE OF THE MANY THAT WE

1310
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
ALL LOST.

1311
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THAT'S NEXT.

1312
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
DO YOU EVER WISH
WE HAD iPADS...

1313
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
TO PRACTICE MATH
MORE?

1314
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I LOVE MATH!

1315
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
BUT TWO iPADS
MEANS TWO DATA PLANS?

1316
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THAT'S CRAZY.

1317
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
MAYBE NOT.

1318
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WITH AT&T MOBILE SHARE,

1319
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
ADDING AN iPAD
IS JUST $10 A MONTH.

1320
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
BUT HONESTLY, MOM AND DAD'S LOVE
IS ALL I REALLY NEED.

1321
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
WE SHOULD KEEP THESE
FOR US.

1322
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
WE SHOULD KEEP THESE.

1323
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WHAT?!

1324
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
[ Male Announcer ]
AT&T MOBILE SHARE.

1325
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
ADD AN iPAD
FOR JUST $10 A MONTH.

1326
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
ONE PLAN. UP TO 10 DEVICES.

1327
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
AT&T. RETHINK POSSIBLE.

1328
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
>>> WE HAVE A QUICK UPDATE ON
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS IN NEWTOWN,

1329
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
CONNECTICUT.

1330
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA COMING
HERE TOMORROW TO MEET WITH THE

1331
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1332
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
HE'S ALSO EXPECTED TO ATTEND AN

1333
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL SCHEDULED TO BE
HELD TOMORROW EVENING.

1334
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER, PETER
LANZA, ISSUED A STATEMENT

1335
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
TONIGHT OFFERING HIS CONDOLENCES

1336
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
TO THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1337
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
AND WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT

1338
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
THE VICTIMS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1339
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
SIX WOMEN AND 20 STUDENTS DIED

1340
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THERE.

1341
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
12 GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS, ALL 6 OR 7

1342
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
YEARS OLD.

1343
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THE STATE'S CHIEF MEDICAL

1344
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
EXAMINER SAYS ALL OF THEM DIED

1345
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1346
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

1347
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
NOW TRYING TO EMOTIONALLY HANDLE

1348
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
THIS TRAGEDY, FRIENDS, FAMILY

1349
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
AND RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN,

1350
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
CONNECTICUT, TRYING TO START

1351
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
DOWN THAT ROAD TO RECOVERY RIGHT

1352
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
NOW.

1353
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
OUR DR. SANJAY GUPTA VISITED A

1354
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
GRIEF CENTER TODAY AND HE TALKED

1355
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
TO SOME OF THEM.

1356
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ANDERSON

1357
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
EARLIER.

1358
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT,

1359
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THIS WAS SO RAW, I DIDN'T KNOW

1360
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
IF PEOPLE WERE GOING TO ACTUALLY

1361
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
GO TO THIS CENTER

1362
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
WE WEREN'T FILMING ANYTHING OUT

1363
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
OF RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVACY.
BUT PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT WITH

1364
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
CHILDREN, PROBABLY CHILDREN FROM

1365
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THE SCHOOL, A LOT OF PARENTS

1366
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
WALKING WITH THEM INTO THE
SCHOOL.

1367
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
AND THERE WERE PSYCHIATRISTS,
PSYCHOLOGISTS, CHILDREN'S

1368
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
COUNSELORS IN THE SCHOOL.

1369
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I THINK WHAT WAS STRIKING IS
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN AND THEY

1370
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
WERE STAYING IN FOR A LONG TIME.

1371
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
THIS WAS SORT OF A GRIEVING BUT

1372
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ALSO HEALING GOING ON.

1373
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE

1374
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
COMMUNITY WAS SORT OF AN

1375
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
INDIVIDUAL, MEANING THAT YOU SAW

1376
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING

1377
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU WERE.

1378
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
AND PEOPLE WERE BEING COMFORTED

1379
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
BY THAT IN SOME WAY.

1380
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

1381
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM WHO LOST

1382
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
A SON, MY BROTHER.

1383
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
AND SHE WAS SAYING FOR HER, IT

1384
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
HELPED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1385
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM A LOT

1386
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
OF PEOPLE HERE, THAT IT HELPS TO

1387
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
TALK.
AND YET OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF

1388
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
AREN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT IT OR

1389
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT THIS
POINT.

1390
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
>> YEAH.

1391
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I THINK THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE

1392
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

1393
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1394
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
TO EXPECT WHEN I WENT TO THAT

1395
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
CRISIS CENTER TODAY.

1396
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COMMUNITY

1397
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
FOR THE MOST PART IS READY TO

1398
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
TALK.

1399
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SMALL SAMPLE

1400
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
SIZE.

1401
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
BUT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1402
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
AND THE FEELING OF ISOLATION,

1403
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
THINKING THAT I'M GOING THROUGH

1404
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THIS ALONE, THAT NO ONE QUITE

1405
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS HAS DONE

1406
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
TO ME CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL AND

1407
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
QUITE DAMAGING LONG TERM AS

1408
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
WELL.

1409
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE GOING

1410
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THROUGH IT -- EVEN JUST BEING

1411
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
THERE IN THE CRISIS CENTER WITH

1412
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I THINK, SEEMED TO

1413
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
BE THERAPEUTIC FOR THEM.

1414
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
>> AND A LOT OF PARENTS HERE AND

1415
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
AROUND THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO

1416
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR
KIDS ABOUT IT.

1417
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I TALKED TO SOME PARENTS LAST

1418
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
NIGHT WHOSE KIDS WERE IN THE

1419
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
SCHOOL AND THANKFULLY HAD
SURVIVED.

1420
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
AND THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILD TO KIND

1421
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
OF BRING IT UP TO THEM.
AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT.

1422
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THEY
KNOW.

1423
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN IN THE
SCHOOL KNOW.

1424
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
BUT EVEN OTHER CHILDREN IN THE

1425
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
COMMUNITY KNOW, EVEN IF THEY

1426
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION

1427
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
JUST IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE.

1428
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THE THING THAT KEEPS COMING BACK

1429
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
IS THEY SORT OF DIRECT THE

1430
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
CONVERSATION.

1431
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SO YOU SORT OF GET YOUR OWN

1432
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
FEELINGS IN CHECK FIRST AS AN

1433
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
ADULT OR AS A PARENT.

1434
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
AND THEN YOU FILL IN DETAILS AS

1435
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
APPROPRIATE, AS AGE APPROPRIATE,
LEAVING OUT OBVIOUSLY GRAPHIC

1436
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
DETAILS.

1437
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU

1438
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
DON'T WANT TO BE FALSE OR YOU

1439
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT IN

1440
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
TERMS OF WHAT YOU TELL THEM -- I

1441
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY

1442
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
DAUGHTER.

1443
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
SHE STARTED ASKING ABOUT SOME OF

1444
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1445
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THEY

1446
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
IMMEDIATELY WANT TO HUMANIZE

1447
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THIS IN SOME WAY FOR THEMSELVES.

1448
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
IT'S A TOUGH CONVERSATION TO

1449
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
HAVE.

1450
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL

1451
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
WAS GOING TO BE SAFE.

1452
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I HAD TO SAY, LOOK, DADDY'S

1453
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
SCHOOL NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO

1454
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HIM.
MOMMY'S SCHOOL NEVER HAD IT

1455
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
HAPPEN TO HER.

1456
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED.

1457
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP

1458
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
YOU SAFE.

1459
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
IT'S TOUGH BUT AN IMPORTANT
CONVERSATION.

1460
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
>> AND ONE FATHER REFUSES TO

1461
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
THINK OF HIS DAUGHTER AS JUST

1462
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THE VICTIM OF A HORRIBLE CRIME.

1463
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THIS IS HOW ROBBIE PARKER SAYS

1464
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
HE'LL REMEMBER HIS 6-YEAR-OLD

1465
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
LITTLE GIRL.

1466
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

1467
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

1468
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

1469
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

1470
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

1471
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

1472
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

1473
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
THEM.

1474
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE
SHOOTER.

1475
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1476
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

1477
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

1478
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

1479
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

1480
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1481
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

1482
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

1483
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1484
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

1485
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

1486
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

1487
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

1488
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1489
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1490
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

1491
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

1492
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

1493
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

1494
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

1495
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

1496
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN

1497
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

1498
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

1499
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

1500
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

1501
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

1502
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

1503
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

1504
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

1505
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

1506
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
VERY LOVING.

1507
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

1508
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

1509
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

1510
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

1511
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

1512
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

1513
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

1514
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

1515
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1516
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

1517
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

1518
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

1519
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

1520
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

1521
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

1522
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

1523
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING
NOTE.

1524
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

1525
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

1526
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

1527
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

1528
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

1529
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

1530
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

1531
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

1532
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

1533
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

1534
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
LIFE.

1535
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

1536
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

1537
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

1538
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

1539
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

1540
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

1541
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

1542
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

1543
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

1544
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

1545
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

1546
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

1547
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
CRAFTS.
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

1548
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

1549
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
COMFORT.

1550
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

1551
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
AND A DAD.

1552
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

1553
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

1554
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

1555
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

1556
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

1557
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1558
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1559
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

1560
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

1561
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

1562
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
REMARKABLE.

1563
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1564
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

1565
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
DAD.

1566
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

1567
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

1568
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

1569
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

1570
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

1571
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
PORTUGUESE.

1572
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

1573
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

1574
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

1575
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

1576
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

1577
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
THE DOOR.

1578
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

1579
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

1580
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
US.

1581
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1582
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

1583
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1584
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT
AWAY.

1585
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1586
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE
