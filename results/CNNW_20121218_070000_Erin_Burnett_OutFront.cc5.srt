AWKWARD.

A RETIRED STOCKBROKER, NANCY

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
LANZA WAS A LIFELONG RED SOX FAN

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
WITH SEASON TICKETS WHO LIVED

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WITH HER SON ADAM IN A LARGE

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
COLONIAL HOME AND FRIENDS SAY

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SHE WAS A LITTLE CONTRADICTION,

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
EXTREMELY GENEROUS AND FRIENDLY

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
YET EXTREMELY PRIVATE WHEN IT

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
CAME TO HER FAMILY LIFE.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THEY SAY SHE DID TALK ABOUT THE

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
CHALLENGES SHE FACED RAISING A

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SON WITH ASPERGER'S SYNDROME AND

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
HER FRIENDS SAY SHE THOUGHT SHE

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
MAY SOON BE LEAVING NEWTOWN.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
>> SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WASHINGTON STATE AND READY TO

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CHANGE HER WHOLE LIFE, SELL HER

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
HOUSE AND START OVER, JUST FOR

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HIM, JUST SO HE COULD GO TO

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SCHOOL AND HE WAS HER LIFE.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> FRIENDS SAY NANCE ALANZA WAS

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A GUN ENTHUSIAST AND HAD TAKEN

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
UP TARGET SHOOTING AS A HOBBY

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AND THEY INSIST SHE WAS ALWAYS

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
RESPONSIBLE WITH GUNS.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> THEY PAINTED HER AS SOME

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IRRESPONSIBLE GUN FREAK AND SHE

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WASN'T.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SHE WAS THE EPITOME OF

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
RESPONSIBILITY AND SHE WAS A

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
PARAGON FOR GUN SAFETY AND

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TAUGHT THE BOYS HOW TO USE THE

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
GUNS RESPONSIBLY.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THE SON

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
SHE DOTED ON AND TAUGHT HOW TO

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
USE GUNS WOULD TURN THOSE GUNS

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
ON HER AND CHILDREN.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THEY BELIEVE HE SHOT AND KILLED

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
HIS MOTHER AS SHE WAS LYING IN

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SHE CAME IN MORE TO PICK UP FOOD

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000

YEAR-AND-A-HALF.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HE WAS A BUSSER.

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> HE WAS?

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
OKAY.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> ADAM WAS NEVER A SOCIAL
PERSON.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
HE USED TO COME IN AND KEEP HIS

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HEAD DOWN AND NEVER SURE OF

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
HIMSELF.

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
CONDITION THERE, ASBERGER'S AND

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ALWAYS HAD AN ISSUE IN SCHOOL

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SOCIALLY BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT KID AND HIGH

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I.Q. AND GRADUATED AROUND TENTH

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
VERY, VERY INTELLIGENT KID, AND

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I MENTIONED EARLIER, TOO, A LOT

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OF PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
ASBERGER'S AND I WOULD LIKE TO

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I THINK THAT A LOT OF KIDS HAVE

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
IT, AND I DON'T THINK IT HAS

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SITUATION AT ALL BECAUSE KIDS

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WITH THAT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> SHE TALKED, NANCY TALKED

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THROUGH THE YEARS ABOUT HER SON.

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> SHE CAME IN HERE AND WE

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SOCIALIZED AND WENT OUT AND

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE FAMILY.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SHE WAS -- SHE JUST CAME IN TO

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
HAVE A GREAT TIME, TO TALK,
AND --

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> GET IT OFF HER MIND IF

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ANYTHING.

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> SHE DID BUT SHE WOULD ONLY

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SAY IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR HER,

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HER, BRINGING HIM UP AND SHE WAS

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
ALWAYS --

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> SHE TALKED ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE OF IT.

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> YEAH, BUT ALWAYS ON IT.

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SHE WAS JUST SAYING, YEAH, NEVER

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO COME IN

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT AND

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SHE WOULD MENTION IT HAS BEEN

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
DIFFICULT AND SO MUCH FOR HIM TO

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
TRY TO GET HIM HELP HERE OR

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THERE OR DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD A

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
LOT ABOUT IS SHE WAS PASSIONATE

214
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ABOUT GUNS AND COLLECTED GUNS.

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU KNEW ABOUT

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OR SURPRISED WHEN YOU HEAR?

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST THREE

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
YEARS OR SO SHE PICKED UP THE

219
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
HOBBY.

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO GOT HER INTO

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
IT.

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SHE REALLY ENJOYED IT, TARGET

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
SHOOTING, SO I DIDN'T KNOW.

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I HAD NO IDEA.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> NOT COLLECTING?

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> SHE WAS A TARGET SHOOTER.

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SHE PROBABLY HAD SOME GUNS SHE

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
USED TO TAKE TO THE RANGE AND

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PRACTICE WITH.

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE OWNED OR

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WHAT SHE HAD.

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SHE JUST SAID SHE ENJOYED IT AND

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THAT WAS IT.

234
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE TOOK HER

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SONS, DIDN'T TAKE HER SONS, SHE

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH.

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I TOOK THIS UP, IT IS FUN, THAT

238
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
KIND OF THING.

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> GIVEN THAT YOU KNEW HER AS A

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PERSON, WOULD YOU -- DO YOU

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THINK SHE IS THE KIND OF

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
APPROXIMATE EARN THAT WOULD HAVE
THE GUNS AROUND THE HOUSE?

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
WOULD THEY BE LOCKED UP?

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
>> THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
UP.

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> SHE IS FAR TOO BRIGHT FOR
THAT.

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
SHE WAS VERY SMART.

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SHE UNDERSTOOD.

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS ARE THAT

251
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
YOU HAVE HEARD ON THE NEWS?

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> I THINK MOSTLY BETWEEN THE

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
CONDITION HE HAD WHICH PEOPLE

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
COULD CONFUSE FOR BEING THE

255
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
REASON AND THE GUNS.

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I MEAN, WE DON'T THINK IT HAS

257
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
CHARACTER.

259
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
>> DONATED HER TIME WITH ALL THE

260
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
CHARITABLE WORK AND HELPING

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
PEOPLE THAT NEEDED HELP AND

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HELPING AIDS PEOPLE AND DONATING

263
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
MONEY AND FOR AIDS AND CHARITY

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

265
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SHE DIDN'T GET PAID FOR DOING

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WHAT SHE DID AND SHE DID ALL

267
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
CHARITABLE WORK AND ALL ON HER

268
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
OWN.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
>> VERY GENEROUS.
>> VERY GENEROUS PERSON.

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
COULD BE SITTING HERE AND YOU

271
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ARE TALKING TO HER AND THEY

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WOULD BE SAYING I DON'T HAVE ANY

273
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
MONEY FOR THIS OR ANY MONEY FOR

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
THAT AND SHE WOULD TAKE HER
CHECKBOOK OUT AND WRITE A CHECK

275
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND GIVE IT TO THE PERSON

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WITHOUT KNOWING THEM.

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WAS.

279
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I WANT TO BRING IN SUSAN

281
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
CANDIOTTI WITH THE LATEST ON THE

282
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
INVESTIGATION.

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I KNOW WE WERE HEARING THOSE

284
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
FRIENDS OF NANCY LANZA TALKING

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ABOUT HOW SHE PICKED UP THE

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
HOBBY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS

287
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND THEY DON'T THINK SHE

288
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WOULD -- THEY WERE VERY ADAMANT

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SHE WOULDN'T BE THE PERSON THAT

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
WOULD LEAVE HER GUNS LOOSE.

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SHE WOULD LOCK THEM UP WHAT ARE

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
YOU LEARNING ABOUT TARGET

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SHOOTING, NANCY LANZA AND ADAM?

294
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO LOOK AT.

296
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WHAT WERE BOTH DOING, IN

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
PARTICULAR HER SON?

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THEY'RE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT
THAT.

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THEY'RE LEARNING THAT IN FACT

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BOTH MOTHER AND SON HAVE BEEN TO

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
TARGET PRACTICE AND DID GO TO

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
GUN RANGES AND SEVERAL TIMES

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

304
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OFTEN YET BUT MOST RECENTLY FOR

306
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ADAM ANYWAY WAS IN THE LAST SIX

307
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
MONTHS, AND AGAIN OVER THE

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS.

309
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THE REASON THEY DON'T KNOW THE

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
BIG PICTURE, THE FULL PICTURE

311
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
YET IS BECAUSE ATF IS STILL IN

312
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THE PROCESS OF CANVASSING ALL OF

313
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THE GUN RANGES IN THE AREA AND

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THERE ARE A TON OF THEM IN

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ADDITION TO LICENSED GUN DEALERS

316
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TO TRY TO GET MORE INFORMATION

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
ABOUT THIS.

318
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY'RE STILL FOLLOWING A LOT OF

319
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
LEADS, AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING

320
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
AT COMPUTERS, COMPUTERS THAT

321
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE

322
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
HOME, A COUPLE OF THEM WE HAVE

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
LEARNED FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

324
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OFFICIALS IS THAT THEY WERE

325
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SMASHED, SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS.

326
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
>> TRYING TO DESTROY EVIDENCE.

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE

328
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
CASE.

329
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THAT'S THE APPARENT INDICATION.

330
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
NOW THEY HAVE TO PICK UP THE

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PIECES LITERALLY AND TRY TO PULL

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THINGS TOGETHER AND EXAMINE THE

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
HARD DRIVE WHAT WILL THEY LOOK

334
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
FOR?

335
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THEY WILL BE CHECKING TO SEE IF

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
HE SENT E-MAILS TO ANYONE, WHAT

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WEBSITES DID HE VISIT, WAS IN

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS, ANY

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
INDICATION AS TO A POSSIBLE

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
MOTIVE IN ALL OF THIS.

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
WHO DID HE COMMUNICATE WITH IF

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ANYONE?

343
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

344
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT, AND REMEMBER

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THEY ARE ALSO DOING A COMPLETE

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
HISTORY OF ALL OF THE WEAPONS

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THAT WERE USED IN THIS TERRIBLE

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
TRAGEDY.

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WE HAVE GOT THE ONE MADE BY

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
BUSHMASTER WHICH WAS THE ASSAULT

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
TYPE RIFLE, AND WE KNOW THAT HE

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
CAME ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS WITH

353
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A TON OF AMMUNITION.

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HE WAS ARMED TO THE HILT WHEN HE

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WENT TO THAT SCHOOL, MULTIPLE

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
MAGAZINES.

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> HUNDREDS BULLETS.

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> EXTRA BULLETS ON TOP OF THAT,

359
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
30 ROUND MAGAZINES, A LOT TO GO

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
OVER, SO THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT

361
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
ALL OF THAT.

362
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WE WERE ALSO THERE YESTERDAY

363
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WHEN WE SAW HIS CAR BEING TOWED

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
AWAY.

365
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING OVER

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THAT VEHICLE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
INSIDE THE TRUNK, YOU WILL

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
REMEMBER, WAS AN EXTRA RIFLE.

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
>> I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT

370
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
MOTIVE AND WHEN THEY GET THIS

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
INFORMATION THEY'LL GET MORE AND
MORE INFORMATION.

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WHERE YOU LIVE BUT WHERE WE LIVE

556
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
PRETTY SHORT-TERM, AND SO THIS

558
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
FACILITY FOR YOUNG ADULTS, 10 TO

559
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
14 DAYS MAYBE AT THE MOST, MAYBE

560
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
EVEN LESS, AND AFTER THAT THERE

561
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
AREN'T A LOT OF GOOD OPTIONS FOR

562
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
CONTINUED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

563
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
HERE.

564
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

565
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
THAT I AM FACING, THE ADVICE I

566
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
GOT WAS I NEEDED TO PRESS

567
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
CHARGES SO THAT WE COULD CREATE

568
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
A PAPER TRAIL AGAIN AND HE DID

569
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
GET EXCELLENT FOLLOW THROUGH

570
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
CARE WHEN HE HAD TO DO JUVENILE

571
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
DETENTION AS A YOUNGER BOY, BUT

572
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE JAIL IS

573
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR MY SON, AND

574
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I AM JUST REALLY HOPING THAT WE

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
CAN FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION FOR

576
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
HIM.

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
>> YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR

578
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
WRITING THIS BLOG AND I KNOW

579
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT FAR AND

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
YOU WROTE IT UNDER YOUR OWN NAME

581
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
SO PEOPLE COULD FIGURE OUT WHO

582
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
YOUR SON IS AND I KNOW MICHAEL

583
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
ISN'T HIS REAL NAME AND ANYONE

584
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
THAT KNEW YOU COULD FIGURE IT

585
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
OUT.

586
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR

587
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
DOING THAT.

588
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
MAYBE IF HE DOES GROW UP AND GET

589
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THROUGH THIS AND IS ABLE TO

590
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
BECOME A FUNCTIONING MEMBER OF

591
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
SOCIETY THAT THIS WOULD DOG HIM

592
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND

593
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
YOUR WORDS WOULD BE THERE.

594
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

595
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
>> THOSE KINDS OF CRITICISMS

596
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
WILL COME UP ANY TIME THERE IS A

597
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

598
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I REALIZE

599
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THIS SOUNDS HOPELESSLY NAIVE

600
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
NOW.

601
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
DID I BELIEVE THAT MY BLOG WAS

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
ANONYMOUS, AND IF YOU LOOK AT

603
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
THE THE SOCCER MOM MY NAME IS

604
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
NOT ON THERE.

605
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WHERE THE LINK CAME IS WITH IS

606
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
WHEN I PUBLISHED ON THE BLUE

607
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
REVIEW, AND THAT WAS LINKED TO

608
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
MY BLOG.

609
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THAT, YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, AS YOU

610
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
PROBABLY KNOW, THERE IS A GREAT

611
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WOMAN NAMED SARA OUT THERE WHO

612
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
HAS A WONDERFUL BLOG, VERY

613
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
ARTICULATE AND PASSIONATE AND

614
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CHILDREN'S
PRIVACY ISSUES.

615
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
FRANKLY, ERIN, I THINK THEY ARE

616
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
CONCERNS ARE LEGITIMATE AND

617
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDREN'S

618
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
PRIVACY ISSUES ARE LEGITIMATE.

619
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
MY SON DOES KNOW ABOUT THIS
PIECE.

620
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
HIS TAKE ON IT WAS, MOM, IF WE

621
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
CAN HELP PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND,

622
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THEN THIS IS A GOOD THING.

623
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
>> LIZA, LET ME ASK YOU, YOU

624
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
MENTIONED SARA, AND OF COURSE

625
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WHO YOU'RE REFERRING TO, SHE WAS

626
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ANOTHER MOM, INCREDIBLY

627
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU AND YOU PUT

628
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
OUT A JOINT STATEMENT SAYING

629
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

630
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

631
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
WHEN SHE POSTED ONLINE SOME OF

632
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
YOUR PRIOR BLOGS, I READ THEM.

633
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
YOU WROTE THINGS ABOUT YOUR

634
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
SON'S BEHAVIOR.

635
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
IT MAKES WANT TO THROTTLE YOU

636
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
AND I QUIT, LET THE STATE TAKE

637
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
CARE OF YOU AND ANOTHER TIME MY

638
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
DAY DREAMS INVOLVE MY DEATH OR

639
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
FEDERAL PRISON.

640
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ARE THOSE THE RAW EMOTIONS YOU

641
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
FEEL AS A MOTHER AND MOST PEOPLE

642
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
DON'T SAY OR WERE YOU

643
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
EXAGGERATING OR TELL ME HOW THAT
HAPPENED.

644
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> WELL, I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, I

645
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
HAVE TO ADMIT YOU GUYS HAVE ALL

646
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SCRUTINIZED MY BLOG A WHOLE LOT

647
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
MORE THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT

648
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED.

649
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN AMERICA

650
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
THINKS ANYONE READS THEIR BLOGS,

651
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
SO, YEAH, I THINK ONE OF THE

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
HALLMARKS OF MY WRITING AND ONE

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
OF THE REASONS THIS LAST PIECE

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
CONNECTED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IS

655
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO JUST

656
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
KIND OF SAY WHAT IS ON MY MIND,

657
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
AND I WROTE THOSE WORDS AND

658
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
THOSE ARE MY WORDS.

659
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I AM NOT DISOWNING THEM.

660
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FOUR-YEAR --

661
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THAT'S A FOUR-YEAR SLICE OF

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
HISTORY.

663
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

664
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
DO YOU OWN A GUN?

665
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
>> HEAVEN'S NO, NO, NO, NO.

666
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE

667
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
WRITING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH HERE

668
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU

669
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
HAVE FAIR POINTS, BUT YOU KNOW

670
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
DON'T LET THIS OBSCURE THE

671
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED TO HAVE

672
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND WHAT WE

673
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
NEED TO DO.

674
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, NO.

675
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I HAVE CAUGHT THAT FROM MORE

676
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
THAN ONE PERSON AND I THINK THAT

677
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THE LINE IN QUESTION IS

678
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS EASY TO

679
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND IT IS

680
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
TIME TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

681
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
AND IF I CAN CLARIFY WHAT I MEAN

682
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
BY EASY, IT IS THAT WE CAN FRAME

683
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE IN TERMS

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
OF WRITE AND WRONG.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
IT IS RIGHT TO HAVE GUN CONTROL

686
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
OR IT IS WRONG IF SOME PEOPLE

687
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
WOULD SAY TO HAVE GUN CONTROL,

688
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
SO THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY TO DEBATE

689
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A QUESTION.

690
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY THAT

691
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
MENTAL HEALTH IS RIGHT OR WRONG.

692
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> YES.

693
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ALL RIGHT.

694
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LIZA.

695
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME

696
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
AND COMING AND TALKING ABOUT IN.

697
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> THANK YOU, ERIN.

698
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

699
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HIGHLIGHTING THIS IMPORTANT

700
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND I

701
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO

703
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
HAVE AS A NATION THAT WE NEED TO

704
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
DO SOMETHING FOR OUR CHILDREN

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
AND ADULTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH

706
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

707
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
ISSUES.

708
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
>> WE CERTAINLY DO.

709
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
THANKS.

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
>> THANK YOU.

711
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
>>> I ASKED LIZA WHY SHE PUT A

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
PICTURE UP OF HER SON ON HER

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
BLOG SINCE SHE CHANGED HIS NAME

714
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
AND WANTED TO PROTECT HIS

715
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
PRIVACY AND SHE WAS VERY OPEN.

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THE PICTURE IS AGE 7 AND HE

717
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I WANT TO BRING IN DR. SANJAY

719
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
GUPTA.

720
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SANJAY, WHEN YOU HEAR THIS

721
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
STORY, AND YOU SEE LIZA TALKING

722
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ABOUT HER CHILD AND HER

723
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
STRUGGLES, SHE HAS TAKEN A LOT

724
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
OF CRITICISM FOR THAT FROM A LOT

725
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
OF PEOPLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

726
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> IT WAS A REALLY GOOD

727
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
INTERVIEW.
IT WAS INTERESTING.

728
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
YOU ALMOST GOT THE SENSE IT WAS

729
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
A LITTLE THERAPEUTIC FOR HER,

730
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
HER WRITING, SHE WRITES THIS

731
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
STUFF AND NOW SEEING HER AND

732
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
MEETING HER THROUGH THAT

733
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
INTERVIEW, YOU CAN TELL SHE IS

734
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
NOT THE KIND OF MOM TO DO THESE

735
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THINGS BUT SHE IS FRUSTRATED.

736
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE, IMAGINE

737
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THIS, THE THRESHOLD TO GET YOUR

738
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
CHILD TREATMENT IS THAT THEY

739
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000

GO TO THE HOSPITAL IF YOU'RE

743
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000

NOT THERE.

763
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WHEN YOU PRESCRIBE A MEDICATION

MEDICATION, ALL THE LITERATURE

766

SAYS YOU HAVE TO MONITOR THE

767

PERSON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND

768
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THAT'S A VERY VULNERABLE TIME
PERIOD.

769

770

THEY GET PRESCRIPTIONS AND DON'T

GET THE FOLLOW-UP AND THAT'S A

772
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
REAL PROBLEM AND SOMETHING THAT

773
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
IT COMES UP EVEN WITH REGARD TO

774
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000

IN DENIAL, RIGHT?

778

>> YEAH.
I THINK DENIAL IS A BIG PART OF

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THIS.

784
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
GET THEIR CHILDREN TREATMENT AND

790
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
IT MEANS GIVING THEM A CRIMINAL

791
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
RECORD OR SOMEHOW SAYING THEY'RE

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
GOING TO HARM PEOPLE AND THEY

793
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
DON'T WANT TO TOO THAT.

794
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000

924
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HEARTBREAKING

925
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
TO BE THERE TODAY.

926
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
>> CERTAINLY BECAUSE IT JUST

927
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

928
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000

SLEEVED SHIRTS AND SWEATSHIRTS

941
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THAT HAD NEWTOWN WRESTLING ON IT

942
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
AND THE FAMILY HAD HAD ASKED FOR
PRIVACY.

943
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
WE TRIED TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH

944
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
PRIVACY AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN YOU

945
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THINK ABOUT THE GLOBAL

946
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
SPOTLIGHT, THEY TRIED TO HAVE AS

947
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
MUCH ALONE TIME AS POSSIBLE AND

948
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
CERTAINLY THERE IS A LOT OF

949
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
INTEREST IN THIS LITTLE BOY WHO

950
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
LOVED SPORTS SO MUCH AND ONE

951
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
CHILD WHO SHOWED UP TO MOURN

952
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TODAY WAS ACTUALLY WEARING A

953
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
MEDAL AND THE MEDAL IS

954
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE I SPOKE TO A

955
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
MEMBER OF A WRESTLING TEAM IN A

956
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
NEARBY TOWN AND THIS TEAM SAYS

957
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000

FIRST MATCH, HE WON HIS FIRST

960
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
MEDAL.
AS YOU MENTIONED, HIS REAL LOVE

961
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
WAS FOOTBALL.

962
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
HE LOVED THE NEW YORK GIANTS.

963
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
HE LOVED VICTOR CRUZ, AND THAT

964
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
MESSAGE WENT ALL THE WAY TO

965
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
CRUZ.

966
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
HE TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE.

967
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
HE TOOK A PICTURE OF HIS CLEATS

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
AND HIS GLOVES THAT HAD THE NAME

969
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
JACK PINTO ON IT.

970
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
HE SAID THIS GAME IS FOR YOU AND

>> IT WAS EMOTIONAL, MAN.

974
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I WAS FIGHTING BACK TEARS TO DO

975
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
IT AND IT FELT GOOD.

976
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IT FELT GOOD TO HONOR A FAMILY

977
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000

982
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
UNBELIEVABLE TO EVEN LISTEN TO

983
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
ON THE NEWS.

984
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I PUT MY DAUGHTER INTO BED WITH

985
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
ME THAT NIGHT.

986
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000

ANYONE KNEW THE HORROR THAT HAD

1021
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
HAPPENED, HE DISCOVERED SIX

1022
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
TERRIFIED CHILDREN ON HIS FRONT

THANK YOU.

1028
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I KNOW IT IS HARD AND WITH ALL

1029
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
OF THE MEDIA HERE TO COME AND

1030
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

1031
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
WHEN YOU SAW THOSE CHILDREN ON

1032
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
YOUR YARD, DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG?

1034
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> I HAD NO IDEA.

1035
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING A SKIT

1036
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
AND MAYBE THEY WERE CUB SCOUTS

1037
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
OR GIRL SCOUTS AND PRACTICING

1038
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SITTING SO

1039
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
NICELY AND THEN I SAW A MAN IN A

1040
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
VERY AGITATED WAY SAYING IT IS

1041
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, AND HE

1042
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
KEPT RAISING HIS VOICE AND I

1043
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THOUGHT THAT WAS SO STRANGE, AND

1044
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I CAME TO THE CHILDREN AND THEY

1045
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
WERE CRYING AND WAILING AND

1046
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
MORTIFIED AND THERE WAS A SCHOOL

1047
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
BUS DRIVER WITH THEM AND I

1048
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
INVITED THEM INTO THE HOUSE, AND

1049
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
SHE SAID THERE HAD BEEN AN

1050
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
INCIDENT AT THE SCHOOL AND I HAD

1051
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS.

1052
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
>> DID THE CHILDREN, HOW DID

1053
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THEY FIND THE WORDS TO TELL YOU?

1054
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THEY TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

1055
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
>> THEY TOLD ME.

1056
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THEY JUST STARTED TALKING.

1057
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE TWO BOYS MOSTLY TALKED, AND

1058
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THEY SAID WE CAN'T GO BACK TO

1059
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THAT SCHOOL, WE CAN'T GO BACK --

1060
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> WE CAN'T GO BACK.

1061
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> OUR TEACHER IS DEAD.

1062
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

1063
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
WE DON'T HAVE A TEACHER.

1064
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I COULD NOT TAKE THAT IN.

1065
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I COULD NOT ACCEPT THAT.

1066
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I JUST KEPT LISTENING TO THEM

1067
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
AND THEN THEY TALKED MORE AND

1068
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THE BOY SAID, OH, NO, IT WAS A

1069
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
BIG GUN AND A SMALL GUN AND THEN

1070
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I KNEW AND THEN THEY SAID THERE

1071
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WAS BLOOD, THERE WAS BLOOD, AND

1072
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
THEN THEY SAID HER NAME, AND I

1073
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
PRAYED THAT IT WASN'T THAT

1074
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
TEACHER, AND IT WAS.

1075
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
IT WAS THAT VERY PRETTY

1076
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
27-YEAR-OLD TEACHER.

1077
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FLED.

1078
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I THINK SHE MUST HAVE PROTECTED

1079
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
THEM AND SAVED THEIR LIVES.

1080
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY RAN ALL THE

1081
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
WAY DOWN THE BOULEVARD, THE

1082
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
STREET NEXT TO THE FIRE HOUSE.

1083
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT TO MY

1084
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
HOUSE.

1085
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
THEY WERE SO BRAVE.

1086
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
THEY WERE SO GOOD.

1087
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I BROUGHT DOWN SOME TOYS FROM MY

1088
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
GRANDSON'S TOY CHEST AND I GAVE

1089
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THEM SOME JUICE AND WE CALLED

1090
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THEIR PARENTS.

1091
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THEY WERE VERY BRAVE.

1092
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
VERY GOOD, AND I WAS AMAZED P I

1093
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
WAS ASTOUNDED AT WHAT THEY WERE

1094
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
TELLING ME.

1095
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> THEY NOTICED EVERYTHING.

1096
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000

1100
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
MOMENT.

1101
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
>> THAT'S WHAT TRAINED ME, BEING

1102
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
A GRANDFATHER.

1103
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I FELT LIKE I WAS WITH MY

1104
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
GRANDCHILDREN, AND I FELT

1105
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH THEM.

1106
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
THAT'S WHAT TRAINED ME, MY

1107
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
GRANDDAUGHTER AND MY GRANDSON,

1108
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AND THEY WERE WITH ME, AND I

1109
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
FELT COMFORTABLE.

1110
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
THEY WERE VERY SWEET, AND THEY

1111
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
CALMED DOWN A LITTLE AND THEY

1112
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WERE SO -- THEY KEPT REPEATING

1113
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THEY CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL

1114
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A

1115
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
TEACHER.

1116
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
>> AND THEY'RE GRIEVING IS GOING

1117
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
TO BE HARD FOR ADULTS TO

1118
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
UNDERSTAND.

1119
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.

1120
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
IT MAY BE MORE INTENSE.

1121
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.

1122
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU HAVE FOR

1123
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
THOSE CHILDREN THAT CAME ONTO

1124
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
YOUR YARD?

1125
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
>> I WANT TO BE REUNITED WITH

1126
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THEM.

1127
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I WANT TO SEE THOSE CHILDREN,

1128
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
AND I WANT TO TELL THEM HOW GOOD

1129
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
AND BRAVE AND STRONG THEY ARE

1130
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
AND I WANT TO TELL THEIR PARENTS

1131
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THAT, AND I WANT TO TELL THEM

1132
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
THAT I WANT TO BE THEIR FRIEND

1133
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
AND I WANT TO READ TO THEM AND I

1134
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
WANT TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING

1135
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
SPECIAL FOR CHRISTMAS AND I WANT

1136
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
TO BE THEIR FRIEND AND I WANT

1137
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THEM TO SEE ME IN LIGHT INSTEAD

1138
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
OF DARKNESS AS I SAW THEM.

1139
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I WANT THEIR PARENTS -- I HOPE

1140
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THEY WILL CALL ME BECAUSE I WANT

1141
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
TO SEE THOSE CHILDREN.

1142
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
THEY WERE VERY GOOD CHILDREN,

1143
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH

1144
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
ONE OF THE BOYS OUT OF THIS

1145
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
GRIEF AND THIS CARNAGE AND HE

1146
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
STOPPED AND HE BECAME VERY

1147
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
COMPOSED AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE

1148
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
STOPPED AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND

1149
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
HE SAID JUST SAYING YOUR HOUSE

1150
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
IS VERY SMALL.

1151
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I THOUGHT, WHAT A BRIGHT,

1152
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
WONDERFUL BOY AND HE JUST

1153
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
BROUGHT TO ALL OF US A RESPITE,

1154
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
A RESPITE FROM ALL OF THIS

1155
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
DARKNESS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

1156
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I WANT TO SEE THESE KIDS.

1157
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I HOPE THEIR PARENTS WILL CALL

1158
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
ME.

1159
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I WANT TO PUT MY ARMS AROUND

1160
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THEM AND TELL THEM THAT I LOVE

1161
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
THEM AND I WANT THE CHILDREN TO

1162
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
BE THE BASIS FOR OUR SOLUTION.

1163
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

1164
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
>> I HOPE THAT THEY ARE AND I

1165
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
HOPE YOU WILL BE THAT WHEN THEY

1166
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
REMEMBER THAT DAY, THE BEACON OF

1167
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
LIGHT FOR THEM, TOO.

1168
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GENE.

1169
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> I SO APPRECIATE YOU LETTING

1170
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ME TELL MY STORY.

1171
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000

CHANGED AND PERHAPS IN A WAY FOR

THIS COUNTRY FOR THE BETTER?

1176
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
JOHN LOOKS AT HOW FINALLY THERE

1177
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
MIGHT BE A REASONABLE

1178
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
CONVERSATION IN THIS COUNTRY
ABOUT GUNS.

1179
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THE HERO PRINCIPAL FROM THE

1180
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
POINT OF VIEW OF A FRIEND WHO

1181
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
KNEW HER.

1182
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS SHELDON, WHOSE LONG DY
SETTING UP THE NEWS

1183
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
STARTS WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND A CHOICE.

1184
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
TAKE TYLENOL OR TAKE ALEVE,

1185
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THE #1 RECOMMENDED PAIN
RELIEVER BY ORTHOPEDIC DOCTORS.

1186
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
JUST TWO ALEVE
CAN KEEP PAIN AWAY ALL DAY.

1187
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
BACK TO THE NEWS.

1188
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
JUST TWO ALEVE
CAN KEEP PAIN AWAY ALL DAY.

1189
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
WITH TWO TIMES THE POINTS
ON DINING IN RESTAURANTS,?

1190
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
YOU MAY FIND
YOURSELF ASKING

1191
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
WHY NOT, A LOT.

1192
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
CHASE SAPPHIRE PREFERRED.

1193
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THERE'S MORE TO ENJOY.

1194
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>>> IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE

1195
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
NEWTOWN TRAGEDY THERE IS GROWING

1196
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
DEMAND FOR TIGHTER CONTROLS ON

1197
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
GUNS.

1198
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
A POLL FOUND A BIG SHIFT, THE

1199
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT SAY THEY

1200
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
STRONGLY SUPPORT STRICTER GUN

1201
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
CONTROL LAWS WENT UP BY FIVE

1202
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
POINTS AND THE NUMBER STRONGER

1203
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
OPPOSED WENT DOWN FIVE POINTS

1204
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
AND AS I RECALL AFTER THE

1205
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
SHOOTING IN AURORA, YOU DIDN'T

1206
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
SEE SUCH A BIG SHIFT.

1207
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
AFTER SOME MASS SHOOTINGS YOU
DO.

1208
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THIS TIME IT IS A BIGGER MOVE,

1209
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
AND THE QUESTION IS WILL IT GAIN

1210
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
EVEN MORE MOMENTUM AND WILL

1211
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WASHINGTON ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING

1212
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
ABOUT IT?
JOHN AVALON IS LOOKING INTO

1213
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THAT.

1214
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I KNOW LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH SIDES

1215
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
OF THE PARTY AND EVEN STAUNCH,

1216
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
STAUNCH MEMBERS THAT ARE

1217
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
STAUNCHLY BACKED BY THE NRA ARE

1218
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
UNITED IN THEIR GRIEF AND SAY

1219
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THEY WANT CHANGE TO HAPPEN.

1220
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
WILL IT?

1221
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
>> ERIN, SOMETIMES IT TAKES A

1222
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
TRAGEDY TO MAKE US CONFRONT
REALITY.

1223
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
AND YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE

1224
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

1225
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
AISLE SAY MAYBE NOW IS NOT THE

1226
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
TIME TO RELY ON IDEOLOGY OR

1227
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
PARTISAN POLITICS BUT TAKE A

1228
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
LONG LOOK ON THE LAWS AROUND

1229
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
GUNS AND NOT INFRINGING ON THE

1230
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
SECOND AMENDMENT BUT WHAT

1231
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS CAN BE

1232
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
PUT IN PLACE.

1233
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS TWO

1234
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
SENATORS WITH NRA RATINGS OF A,

1235
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
JOE MANCHIN AND MARK WARNER SAID

1236
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THIS EVENT CHANGED THEM AND

1237
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
THEY'RE OPEN TO NEW SOLUTIONS.

1238
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT

1239
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
SENATOR MANCHIN TOLD CHRISTIANE

1240
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
AMANPOUR.

1241
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN

1242
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
AMERICA OR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD

1243
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
CHILDREN WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED?

1244
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
IT CHANGED ME.

1245
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY THAT

1246
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
GOES HUNTING WITH AN ASSAULT

1247
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
RIFLE.

1248
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE THAT NEED

1249
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
10, 20, 30-ROUND CLIPS.

1250
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
>> I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN HAS

1251
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND THE

1252
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
ABILITY TO HUNT IS PART OF OUR

1253
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
CULTURE AND I HAVE HAD AN NRA

1254
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
RATING OF AN A, BUT, YOU KNOW,

1255
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

1256
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
>> ERIN, THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF

1257
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WHAT MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT

1258
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
IN EVOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE.

1259
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
THE NATION HAD AN ASSAULT

1260
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
WEAPONS BAND THAT EXPIRED IN

1261
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
2004.

1262
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

1263
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
SENATORS ARE TALKING ABOUT
LOOKING AT.

1264
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
THE FACT THESE SENATORS ARE

1265
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
SAYING THEY'RE OPEN TO THIS KIND

1266
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OF CONVERSATION IS REALLY

1267
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
SIGNIFICANT.

1268
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
>> ALL RIGHT, JOHN, THANK YOU

1269
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
VERY MUCH.

1270
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
>> THANK YOU.

1271
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
>> AS THE RESIDENTS OF MOUNTAIN

MOURN THE LOSS OF FRIENDS AND

1273
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
FAMILY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

1274
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
HELPS KEEP THEM GOING IS
CELEBRATING THOSE BRAVE AMID THE

1275
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
CHAOS.

1276
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS ONE OF THEM.

1277
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
ALL THREE OF HER CHILDREN

I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THREE

1284
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
CHILDREN AND ONE OF YOUR

1285
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
CHILDREN HAS FRIENDS THAT HAVE
LOST SIBLINGS.

1286
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
>> YES.

1287
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT DAWN.

1288
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
YOU KNEW HER WELL AND WORKED

1289
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
WITH HER FOR A WHILE.

1290
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
>> I WORKED WITH HER BECAUSE I

1291
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
WAS VERY ACTIVE AS A MOM IN THE

1292
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
SCHOOL AND MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER

1293
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WHEN SHE WAS THERE DAWN WAS

1294
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
THERE AT THE SAME TIME AND DAWN

1295
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
WAS AN UNUSUAL PRINCIPAL.

1296
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT FORMALITY

1297
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THAT A LOT OF ADMINISTRATORS

1298
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
MIGHT HAVE.

1299
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
SHE HAD A RADIANT SMILE AND SHE

1300
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WAS ALWAYS ABOUT FUN AND WARMTH

1301
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
AND YOU KIND OF FELT LIKE YOU

1302
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
COULD JUST GIVE HER A HUG AS

1303
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SOON AS YOU MET HER AND SHE HAD

1304
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A RARE QUALITY.

1305
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL AND HOW DOES

1306
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
THIS TOWN FEEL?

1307
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
JUST BEING HERE, IT IS SUCH A

1308
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
PICTURE PERFECT LITTLE TOWN.

1309
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
IT IS SMALL AND FEELS LIKE

1310
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
EVERYBODY WOULD KNOW EVERYBODY
ELSE.

1311
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
>> UH-HUH.

1312
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
>> YEAH.

1313
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
WE ARE ALL CONNECTED HERE.

1314
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I FELT A LITTLE CONFLICTED

1315
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
TONIGHT ABOUT COMING OUT.

1316
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THE

1317
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
RIGHT THING TO DO.

1318
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I FELT LIKE I COULD HAVE AN

1319
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

1320
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF THAT

1321
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
WE'RE FEELING AS A COMMUNITY AND

1322
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
WE FEEL NUMB.

1323
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
WE'RE CARRYING OUR GRIEF AROUND

1324
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
WITH US.

1325
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
WE HAVE THE THOUGHTS OF THE

1326
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
PARENTS WHO LOST THEIR CHILDREN

1327
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
IN OUR MINDS ALL THE TIME.

1328
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
IT IS HARD.

1329
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
EVERYTHING STOPPED NOW.

1330
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
IT IS HARD TO GET ON WITH YOUR

1331
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
ROUTINE.

1332
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

1333
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE

1334
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
COFFEE WITHOUT FORGETTING WHAT I

1335
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
AM DOING HALFWAY THROUGH AND I

1336
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
JUST WANT TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT

1337
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
TO MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

1338
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
ESPECIALLY THE ONES GRIEVING THE

1339
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
MOST WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES

1340
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
THAT WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER AND

1341
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THAT THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD IN

1342
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THE WORLD AND THAT WE'RE GOING

1343
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TO HOLD ONTO IT TOGETHER.

1344
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
>> I KNOW YOU WERE TELLING A

1345
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
PERSONAL STORY JUST ABOUT HOW IT

1346
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
IS HARD TO SLEEP.
>> YEAH.

1347
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
>> WHEN YOU DOZED OFF LAST NIGHT

1348
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
AND WOKE UP, YOU HAD TO WAKE

1349
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
YOUR HUSBAND UP TO SEE IF IT WAS

1350
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
REAL.

1351
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
>> I WOKE HIM UP AND SAID IS

1352
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

1353
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THAT'S A LINE THAT HAS BEEN

1354
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD AND I

1355
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
MENTIONED THAT TO FRIENDS OF

1356
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
MINE AND CAN THEY ALL COULD

1357
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
RELATE TO THAT.

1358
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE IT.

1359
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN

1360
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THE

1361
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
BEAUTIFUL SPEECH LAST NIGHT AND

1362
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
HE LISTED THE MASSACRES THAT

1363
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY AND

1364
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS AND AT THE END

1365
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
OF IT CAME THE NAME OF OUR

1366
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
LITTLE TOWN THAT NO ONE ELSE

1367
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
USED TO -- I USED TO HAVE TO

1368
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
EXPLAIN WHERE IT WAS, AND THAT

1369
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
WAS SHOCKING.

1370
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
>> YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE THAT

1371
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
WAY.
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

1372
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
COLUMBINE.
>> EXACTLY.

1373
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ASSOCIATE

1374
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
THE NAME OF OUR TOWN WITH THIS

1375
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

1376
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OUR TOWN IS MORE THAN THAT.

1377
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
IT IS A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE

1378
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WHERE PARENTS ARE SO COMMITTED

1379
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
TO THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION

1380
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
AND BRINGING THEM UP WELL AND MY

1381
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
KIDS HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL

1382
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
MEMORIES OF SANDY HOOK.

1383
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
IT IS A HUGE PART OF THEIR

1384
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
CHILDHOOD AND I HAVE WONDERFUL
MEMORIES THERE, AND I WANT THEM

1385
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

1386
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THOSE MEMORIES AND NOT THINK OF

1387
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
IT AS A CRIME SCENE.

1388
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
>> THIS IS A TOUGH QUESTION TO

1389
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ASK GIVEN MY ROLE.

1390
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THE MEDIA, WHEN I WALK AROUND

1391
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
HERE, I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE

1392
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
ME AND WE'RE TRYING TO COVER THE

1393
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
STORY AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE

1394
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
MAKING IT HARD, TOO, IN SOME

1395
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
WAYS FOR YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT,

1396
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
ERIN.

1397
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I CAME DOWN A COUPLE OF DAYS

1398
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
AGO.

1399
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I CAME DOWN TO THE CENTER OF

1400
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
SANDY HOOK HERE WHEN THE MEDIA

1401
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
WAS HERE, AND I KEPT BUMPING

1402
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
INTO FRIENDS AND FRIENDS OF

1403
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
FRIENDS AND WE WOULD HOLD EACH

1404
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
OTHER AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER AND

1405
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
COME CAN TOGETHER AND THAT FEELS

1406
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
LIKE QUITE ALL RIGHT NOW AND

1407
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WHEN I CAME HERE TONIGHT, I

1408
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY I KNEW, AND

1409
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
WE REALLY FEEL THAT THE NATION

1410
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
FEELS OUR PAIN AND WANTS TO

1411
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
REACH OUT AND WANTS TO BE HERE

1412
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WITH US, AND THAT MEANS A GREAT

1413
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
DEAL.

1414
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS HARD TO

1415
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO DRIVE

1416
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
AROUND YOUR OWN TOWN WHEN REALLY

1417
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
WHAT WE NEED IS TO BE TOGETHER.

1418
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000

1419
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
