506
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS ACT OF

512
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY.

513
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR AN

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
>> WHY CAN'T ONE COP STAY IN A

560
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
PATROL CAR OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL?

561
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
>> LET'S FACE IT LAW ENFORCEMENT

562
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THE DEMANDS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

563
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
ARE INCREASING.

564
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE

565
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
RESOURCES TO DEVOTE TO ONE

566
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
SCHOOL.

567
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
>> KEN TRUMP DO YOU HAVE AN

568
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
OPINION ON THAT?

569
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

570
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
>> ALL OF THE IDEAS STARTING TO

571
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TRICKLE OUT OF WASHINGTON AND

572
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
SOME OF THE BROADER THINGS THAT

573
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
YOU TALKED ABOUT.

574
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WE HAVE SCHOOL RESEARCH OFFICERS

575
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
IN A NUMBER OF OUR SCHOOLS.

576
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WE THE COPS AND SCHOOLS PROGRAM

577
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
FUNDED.
IT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.

578
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
IT WAS ELIMINATED AND THE U.S.

579
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TWO

580
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
YEARS AGO ELIMINATED COMPLETELY.

581
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THEY PROVIDED SECURITY

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
EQUIPMENT.

583
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT HASN'T BEEN

584
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
FOUNDED THIS YEAR.

585
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I HAVE TO POINT AFTER WONDERING

586
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS LIKE YOU

587
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
IN NEWTOWN.

588
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
MY QUESTION IS DO WE NEED TO DO

589
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
SOMETHING NEW AND GO BACK TO THE

590
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
FUNDAMENTALS GO BACK TO THE

591
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THINGS THERE AND FIND OUT WHY

592
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
PEOPLE STOP THAT WHEN THERE

593
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
WASN'T A CRISIS IN THE

594
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
HEADLINES.
>> DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

595
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
HAS FAILED DO YOU THINK HE HAS

596
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
EARNED WHAT HE GOT FROM THE

597
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
BRADY GROUP THAT WANTS TO BAN

598
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

599
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
>> I THINK INSIDE THE BELTWAY

600
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
FAILED AS A WHOLE WITH CONGRESS

601
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
AND THE ADMINISTRATION THEY

602
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
STOPPED THE SCHOOLS ALL OF THESE

603
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
OTHER PROGRAMS GERALDO.

604
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
MY THING IS ONE AGAIN CHIEF SAID

605
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ONE THING IS NOT TO SECURE IT.

606
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THEY POLITICIZE IT RIGHT AWAY.

607
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
TAKE THE THINGS WE KNOW WORK WHY

608
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
DO WE CUT THEM AND WHY DO THEY

609
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
ALLOW THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

610
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
MY FIRST QUESTION IS TO TAKE A

611
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
LOOK AT YOUR VOTING RECORD ASK

612
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
YOURSELF DID YOU VOTE TO LUM

613
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
NATE THOSE RESOURCES.

614
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I AM NOT SUGGESTING IT WILL BE

615
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE CURE BUT WHAT ARE YOU TAKING

616
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THAT ARE USEFUL TO HELP THEM

617
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
PREPARED.

618
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
NEWTOWN HAD A SCHOOLS GRANT BACK

619
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
WHEN IT ORIGINATED FOR A SCHOOL

620
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
OFFICER, WHY DID YOU ALLOW THAT

621
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
TO GO.

622
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WE ARE A ROLLER-COASTER SOCIETY

623
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
PUBLIC POLICY AND PUBLIC

624
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FUNDING.

625
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
IF IT HAPPENED TODAY FINE.

626
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
6 MONTH DOWN THE ROAD IT FALLS

627
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ON THE BACK BURNERS WE SCRATCH

628
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OUR HEADS WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND

629
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
SAY HOW DID IT HAPPEN.

630
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I AM FRUSTRATED 25 YEARS IN THIS

631
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BUSINESS YOU SEE THE SAME THING

632
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

633
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
WE DON'T NEED A COMMISSION TO

634
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
FIGURE THIS OUT.

635
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
MANY OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO

636
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WHY AREN'T WE GETTING IT DONE.

637
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
>> I HEAR YOU AND I TOTALLY

638
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
AGREE.

639
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WE ARE SO FICKLE THE SPOTLIGHT

640
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
IS ON SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURES

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
RESPOND WHEN THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON

642
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AS SOON AS THE NEXT THING DIE

643
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
VERLTS OUR ATTENTION THE

644
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
LEFT-HANDERS ARE ON THE HOOK.

645
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

646
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> GERALDO FIRST THING IS THE

647
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
POLICE THEMSELVES RARELY WOULD

648
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THEY BE ABLE TO NEGATE A

649
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS BY JUST

650
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
RESPONDING.
TOO MUCH TIME GOES BY.

651
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> IN 90 SECONDS THE BAD GUY IS

652
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
IN THERE KILLING KIDS.

653
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
TOUGH STOP IT IN THE FIRST 5

654
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SECONDS.

655
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

656
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
>> SECONDLY THE POLICE HAVE

657
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
LIMITED RESOURCES.

658
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT TAKING

659
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
FROM THE POLICE WITH THEIR

660
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
SECU

661
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
CURRENT NUMBERS.

662
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I MIGHT SUGGEST EACH COMMUNITY

663
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE.

664
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I WOULD HAVE A READY POOL OF

665
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
TRAINED PEOPLE.

666
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
BUT YOU HAVE GOT ALL OF THESE

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
HIGHLY DECORATED VALUED COMBAT

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
VETERANS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN

669
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WHO ARE IN NEED OF JOBS.

670
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WHO BETTER TO PROTECT OUR

671
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
CHILDREN THAN THE PEOPLE WHO

672
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
PROTECTED AND SAVED OUR LIVES ON

673
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THE FRONT LINE.

674
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> WE HAVE 117,000 SCHOOLS IN

675
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THE COUNTRY.

676
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THE VICIOUS

677
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
CYCLE WHERE THE CRISIS HAPPENS

678
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE AND

679
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THEN WE GO BACK TO NORMAL.

680
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY THEY

681
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ARE THINKING SAFETY.

682
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
IF THE MOFTMENT IS FOR ARMED

683
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS -- I DON'T

684
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

685
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
>> I JUST WANT ONE, ONE PERSON A

686
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SUPERINTENDENT, THE HEAD

687
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
JANITOR, IT COULD BE THE FIZZ ED

688
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
TEACHER, IT COULD BE A UNIFORMED

690
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HISTORY TEACHER.

691
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
JUST ONE.

692
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> SO YOU ARE NOT SITTING DUCKS

693
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A MASSACRE GOING

694
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
ON.

695
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.

696
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THAT IS A GOOD DEBATE TO HAVE.

697
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT

698
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE

699
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
BACKGROUND ON THESE PEOPLE AND

700
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
WHO IS GOING TO CARRY THE

701
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
FIREARM.
MORE IMPORTANT THING TO SAY IS

702
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WE NEED TO DIALOGUE WE CAN'T

703
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
KEEP HAVING THESE THINGS AP HEN.

717
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000

FROM THE 35-36 PERCENT.

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS FULL OF

746
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T KNOW QUITE

747
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
WHAT.

748
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

749
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
>> I REALLY HAVE TO DISAGREE

750
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
WITH PEOPLE WHO CALL IT

751
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
POLITICAL THAT YOU DON'T THINK

752
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
YOU CAN TOLERATE IT ANY MORE.

753
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THEY ARE SAYING NOWHERE THEY

754
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ALLOW THINGS TO GO ON.

755
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY.

756
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>> YOU GO HOPEFULLY SAYING A

757
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
COMMISSION ON GUN VIOLENCE AND

758
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT THINGS

759
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THAT ARE FEEDING INTO IT WHETHER

760
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
IT IS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

761
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
WHETHER IT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF

762
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

763
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THEY HAVE MASS KILLINGS AND

764
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
NOT JUST GUN CONTROL.

766
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
>> I CAN DO WITHOUT ASSAULT

767
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WEAPONS BEING AVAILABLE TO EVERY

768
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
TOM, DICK, HARRY AND ADAM.

769
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
JONESBOROS HAPPENS THEY GO AWAY

770
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
AND THEY KEPT ONGOING BACK.

771
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
>> THERE IS A LOT OF

772
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SIMILARITIES CHILDREN, WE SAW

773
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
PARENTS STRUGGLING TO FIND

774
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
ANSWERS FOR THIS.

775
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
THEY HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES WITH

776
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THIS.

777
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
OR SHELL SHOCKED AFTER THAT.

778
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE

779
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
PERSON IN THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

780
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SPEECH WAS HIGHLY POLITICAL.

781
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
SPEAKING FROM THE HEART AS A

782
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
FATHER EXPRESSING HIS SYMPATHIES

783
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I DO LIKE WHAT HE SAID TO WHAT

784
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
DEGREE WE CAN SHARE IN YOUR PAIN

785
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TO EASE YOUR BURDEN.

786
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THAT WAS IMPORTANT.

787
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
IT SHIFTED IN WHAT DO WE NEED TO

788
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
DO HERE.
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

789
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T ZERO ONLY

790
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
IN ON GUN CONTROL.

791
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE.

792
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THAT PERSON SAID THERE'S ALSO

793
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT IS

794
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
VERY IMPORTANT IT CANNOT

795
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
DISREGARD THE INFLUENCE OF THE

796
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN

797
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SITUATIONS INVOLVING MASS

798
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
SHOOTINGS AND TELEVISION AND

799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
VIDEO GAMES THEY HAVE A BIG

800
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
IMPACT ON IT.

801
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
A OO THE BOEHNER PROPOSAL IT

802
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
GOES UP ONLY IF YOU MAKE A

803
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
MILLION OR MORE.

804
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
>> I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

805
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
GREAT DEAL IF THAT'S WHAT HE IS

806
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WILLING TO DO.

807
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THEY ARE ON THE LEFT WHICH IS

808
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
IMPORTANT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY

809
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
WHAT DOES HE CARE?

810
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THEY HAVE TO GET IT THROUGH

811
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
CONGRESS.
THE ANSWER WOULD BE HE'S GOING

812
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
TO HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

813
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
THAT.
THEY WANT TO SEE BECAUSE THE

814
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
PRESIDENT HAS CAVE THE ON THE

815
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
ISSUE IN THE PAST IN THE LEFT

816
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
THEY WANT TO SEE THE TAX RATE

817
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
GOING UP ON EVERYBODY OVER 250.

818
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT IS

819
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
A GREAT DEAL IF YOU CAN GET 39

820
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
PERCENT ON ANYBODY OVER A

821
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
MILLION.
>> ME, TOO.

822
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL LET

823
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
YOU RESPOND ON THAT.

824
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PLUS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE

825
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
ARE SOME ACTUALLY SAYING THAT

826
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS FAKING HER

827
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
INJURY TO AVOID TESTIFYING ABOUT

828
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
BENGHAZI GATE.
YOU WILL HEAR FROM A FORMER U.N.

829
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
AMBASSADOR AFTER THIS.

830
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
>> THEY TESTIFIED SHE HAS EVERY

831
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
EXPECTATION THAT SHE WILL BE

832
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
TESTIFYING.
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU KNOW SHE

833
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
HAS ALREADY STATED SHE WILL BE

834
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
STEPPING DOWN.

835
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD REPORTS

836
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
THAT SENATOR KERRY WHO IS

837
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
HEADING THE SENATE FOREIGN

838
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
RELATIONS COMMITTEE WILL BE

839
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
TAKING HER SPOT.

840
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I FEAR BECAUSE OF THE SHUFFLE

841
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THAT IS GOING ON WE MAY NOT BE

842
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
ABLE TO HEAR FROM SECRETARY

843
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
CLINTON ON THE BENGHAZI

844
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
TERRORIST ATTACK.

845
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
WE WILL BE A POOR NATION FOR IT.

846
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
>> THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT

847
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
REPUBLICANS CRYING FOUL AS

848
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON

849
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
SUFFERING FROM THE AFTERMATH OF

850
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
A CONCUSSION SHE WILL NOT BE

851
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
TESTIFYING ABOUT AGABENGHAZI AF

852
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
ALL.
SHE WILL BE LEAVING AFTER THE

853
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
APPOINTMENT OF SENATOR JOHN

854
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
KERRY TO REPLACE HER.

855
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THE FEAR OF REPUBLICANS IS THEY

856
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
WILL NEVER GET TO HEAR SECRETARY

857
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
CLINTON'S VERSION OF THE TRAGIC

858
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
EVENTS IN LIBYA FORMER

859
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS

860
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
RICHARD WILLIAMSON DO YOU, IS

861
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THAT ACCURATE AMBASSADOR?

862
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
>> I THINK THAT'S AN OVER

863
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
STATEMENT.

864
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
WE ALL HAVE TO HAVE SYMPATHY.

865
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I THINK THE CONCERN IS TWO

866
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
FACTORS HAVE TO BE ANSWERED.

867
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
THE FIRST TIME IN 32 YEARS AN

868
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR WAS KILLED

869
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
IN A TERRORIST ATTACK AS WELL AS

870
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THE OTHER AMERICANS.

871
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE

872
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
STATE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO

873
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
PROVIDE ADEQUATE SECURITY AND

874
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
THEN SECURITIONDLY IT WAS EVIDE

875
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THE TERRORIST STRATEGY OF

876
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
TARGETING KILLINGS OF AL QAEDA

877
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
HAS FAILED THAT AL QAEDA IS VERY

878
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
ACTIVE IN NORTHERN AFRICA.

879
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THOSE ARE THE TWO ISSUES.

880
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
>> DO YOU THINK SHE IS LYING

881
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
ABOUT BEING SICK AND HAVING A

882
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
CONCLUSION?
>> NO, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

883
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD BE

884
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
INAPPROPRIATE FOR HER TO LEAVE

885
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
OFFICE ABOUT AHEARING BEFORE

886
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
CONGRESS.

887
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THERE IS TIME FOR THAT AND I

888
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
HOPE SHE DOES.

889
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
>> YOU STILL THINK THAT SHE

890
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
SHOULD AND YOU BELIEVE HER

891
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
EXPLANATION OF HER MALTY AND HER

892
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
REASONS FOR NOT TESTIFYING NOW.

893
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
>> I HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION

894
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
HER WORD.

895
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WHAT I DO QUESTION IS THE DELAYS

896
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
OF THE STONE WALLING ON BENGHAZI

897
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
SO LONG.
NOW WE HAVE TO GET THE STORY.

898
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
WE WILL HAVE HEARINGS THIS WEEK.

899
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
THERE WILL BE MORE HEARINGS

900
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
HOPEFULLY SECRETARY CLINTON WILL

901
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
MAKE SURE SHE TESTIFYS TO

902
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

903
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OF THE DETAILS OF FAILURE OF

904
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
STATE DEPARTMENT SECURITY AND

905
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THE ADEQUACY OF POLICY ON

906
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
TEARRISM.

907
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
>> IN LITTLE ROCK TONIGHT WHAT

908
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
DO YOU THINK?

909
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
>> I HOPE SECRETARY CLINTON HAS

910
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
A GOOD NOTE FROM HER DOCTOR.

911
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
BAD ENOUGH FOR THE OWE BAM PAW

912
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
CAMPAIGN TO PUT AMBASSADOR RICE

913
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ON THERE SPEAKING ON MORNING

914
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SHOWS GIVING THEM DENY ABILITY

915
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
AS SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

916
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
BENGHAZI BUT NOW WE HAVE THE

917
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THEM ASKING JOHN KERRY TO ANSWER

918
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
QUESTIONS CLINTON SHOULD BE

919
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
DOING.

920
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THEY MISLED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

921
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
AND MISLED THE PRESS.

922
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE FOUR DEAD

923
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES

924
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
DESERVE TO KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD

925
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT COULD

926
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN.

927
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> YOU THINK IN THE NFL WHEN

928
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THEY DOO A TIME-OUT AND THE

929
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
OTHER PEOPLE LINES UP IN A

930
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
FORMATION THAT IS STRANGE AND

931
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THEY ARE AFRAID THAT THEY ARE

932
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
NOT PREPARED FOR IT.

933
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SOME GUY PULLS DOWN MAKES BELIEF

934
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
HE HURT HIS ANKLE OR SOMETHING

935
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THEY HAVE TO PAUSE FOR THE

936
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
STRETCHERS TO COME OUT OR THE

937
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
TRAINERS TO LOOK AT IT?

938
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT THAT

939
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IS?

940
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
>> I HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT

941
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
IS THE CASE.

942
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE IDEA

943
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THAT BECAUSE SHE HAS A

944
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
CONCUSSION SHE IS NOT WORKING TO

945
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
CANCEL THE TRIP SHE IS NOT

946
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
WILLING TO TESTIFY ADDS UP.

947
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I AM SURE CONGRESS IS HAPPY TO

948
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
REARRANGE HAVE HER COME AND

949
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
TESTIFY WHENEVER WOULD WORK FOR

950
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
HER.

951
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
NOT GOING TO BE OUT OF WORK FOR

952
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

953
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

954
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
FURTHERMORE EVEN IF IT WAS AFTER

955
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
SHE LEFT THEY DON'T BAR HER FROM

956
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
KNOWING HOW IT HAPPENED AND WHY

957
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
THIS TRAGEDY OCCURRED AND WHAT

958
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
THE DEPARTMENT PLAYS IN NOT

959
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
PROVIDING TO SECURITY AND SO

960
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
FORTH.
>> SO WE SUSPEND OUR USUAL

961
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
DISBELIEF WHEN A COINCIDENCE IS

962
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
CONVENIE

963
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
CONVENIENT?
>> I AM NOT GOING TO ACCUSE HER

964
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
OF LYING.

965
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> ME EITHER.

966
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
>> SHE SAID SHE FAINTED AND HAS

967
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
A CONCLUSION.

968
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
>> NO.

969
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I BELIEVE THAT PART.

970
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
>> I JUST DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

971
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
BE ALLOWED TO NOT TESTIFY.

972
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THIS IS ABSURD THIS IDEA -- BUY

973
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
THE IDEA SHE CAN'T EVER TESTIFY

974
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
ON THIS BECAUSE SHE IS ILL

975
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

976
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
>> SO IS IT POSSIBLE, THOUGH,

977
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
YOU HAVE THE INAUGURATION YOU

978
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
HAVE THE HOLIDAYS THAT SHE WILL

979
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
NEVER TESTIFY?

980
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
>> I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE BUT

981
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT.

982
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
>> THEY CAN ARRANGE IT AROUND

983
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
HER SCHEDULE.

984
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
>> AMBASSADOR?

985
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
>> GERALDO, CONGRESS WILL COME

986
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
BACK IN SESSION IN JANUARY PRIOR

987
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
TO THE INAUGURAL.

988
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
PRESUMING THAT THE PRESIDENT

989
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
NOMINATES SENATOR KERRY THEY

990
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
WILL BE HEARING THE VOTE ON THAT

991
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
THAT MAY BE DONE BY

992
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
JANUARY 20TH.
THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF WEEKS

993
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
WHERE CONGRESS IS IN SESSION

994
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
HOPEFULLY THE SECRETARY WILL

995
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
UNDERSTAND IT AS PART OF HER

996
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
RESPONSIBILITY THE AMERICAN

997
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
PEOPLE TO COME UP AND EXPLAIN

998
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
WHY THEY FAILED IN SECURITY WHY

999
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
OUR STRATEGY ON TERRORISM IS

1000
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
FAILING.

1001
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
>> AMBASSADOR RICHARD

1002
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
WILLIAMSON.

1003
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000

00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WANT YOU

00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THEY PLAYED A VERY STRAIGHT

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
TRIBUTE TO ALL OF THE VICTIMS OF

1010
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
