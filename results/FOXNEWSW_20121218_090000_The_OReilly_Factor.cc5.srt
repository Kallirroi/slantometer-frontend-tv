1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
WOULD YOU LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
TO KNOW FOR A MONTH STRAIGHT

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
THAT YOU ARE THE SECOND

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
CHOICE?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
>> WELL I AM USED TO BEING

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
SECOND CHOICE MYSELF.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
>> OR THIRD CHOICE.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
IT IN 2008 TOO.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
BACK TO YOU, ANDY.
>> THANKS, TOM.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
THE THING IS THEY NEVER

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
OFFICIALLY SAID SUSAN RICE WAS

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
--

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
>> THEY CAN PULL IT OFF.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
>>> VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
JEDEDIAH BILA AND BILL SCHULZ

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND JOHN BOLTON AND MELISSA

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
MANCHESTER.
I'M TV'S ANDY LEVY.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
>>> "THE O'REILLY FACTOR" IS ON.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
TONIGHT --
>> ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HIPTING HE

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
WILL SUPPORT SOME KIND OF

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
MEASURE TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
IN AMERICA.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SO WHAT THAT MIGHT BE IS A

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
MYSTERY.
WE'LL TELL WHAT YOU HAS WORKED

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
>> SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THAT COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON AND

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
>> AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE 13

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HERE THAN IN OTHER DEVELOPED

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NATIONS.
WHY?

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER THAT

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
QUESTION.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
>> HIDING BEHIND THE SECOND

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
AMENDMENT DOESN'T CUT IT

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
ANYMORE.
IT'S TIME OUR LAWMAKERS REALIZE

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THAT SOCIETY HAS CHANGED.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
>> IT TOOK JUST MINUTES FOR SOME

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
FAR LEFT PUNDITS TO EXPLOIT THE

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TERRIBLE MURDERS IN CONNECTICUT

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
BERNIE GOLDBERG WILL HAVE

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
CAUTION.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE NO

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
SPIN ZONE.

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
"THE FACTOR" BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
>> HI.
I'M BILL O'REILLY.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WHAT DO WE DO, WHAT DO WE DO

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ABOUT VIOLENT EVIL?

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
HAVING DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
ON LEE HARVEY OSWALD FOR

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
"KILLING KENNEDY," I SNOW

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SOMETHING ABOUT VIOLENT EVIL I.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
SAW IT FIRSTHAND IN EL SALVADOR

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND I SAT

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ACROSS ELECTRIC IT WHEN I

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
INTERVIEWED A FORMER SS GUARD

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WHO WORKED AT THE CONCENTRATION

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
CAMP IN GERMANY.

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SO WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA HAD

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
MURDERED 27 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 20

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
LITTLE CHILDREN, I PRETTY MUCH

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
KNEW A FEW THINGS ABOUT LANZA.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
NUMBER ONE, THAT HE WAS DEEPLY

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ANGRY.
NUMBER TWO, THAT HE WAS

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ALIENATED FROM MOST OTHER HUMAN

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BEINGS.

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
NUMBER THREE, THAT MOST LIKELY

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
INTERNET.

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE NOW

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
BEEN ESTABLISHED.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ADAM LANZA COULD NOT LIVE HIS

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
LIFE IN A NORMAL WAY.

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HE HAD ASPERGERS SYNDROME, BUT

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THAT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND THAT IS UNFAIR TO KNOWS WHO

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HAVE THAT PERSONALITY DISORDER,

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OR AUTISM, TO DIAGNOSE HIM

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITHOUT CONCLUSIVE PROOF.

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I GIVE MONEY TO AUTISM CHARITY.

97
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
CONDITION ARE VIOLENT.

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH.

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
STIGMATIZED.
LET'S GET BACK TO LANZA.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT PEOPLE

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
LIKE HIM?

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THE ANSWER IS VERY LITTLE.

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WE'RE A REACTIVE SOCIETY IN

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AMERICA.
OUR FREEDOMS DICTATE THAT WE CAN

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
NOT WAREHOUSE PEOPLE OR STRANGE.

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THEY MUST COMMIT A CRIME OR DO

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE BEFORE
THEY CAN BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
APPARENTLY ADAM LANZA DID NOT DO

111
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THOSE THINGS UNTIL THE DAY HE

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
COMMITTED MASS MURDER.

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SO ATTENTION TURNS TO THE GUNS

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
LANZA TOOK FROM HIS MOTHER WHOM

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HE KILLED BEFORE THE SCHOOL

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
RAMPAGE.
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AMERICA DOES HAVE A GUN CULTURE.

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NEARLY

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN CIRCULATION

120
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
CHILDREN AGES FIVE TO 14 ARE 13

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WITH GUNS HERE AS CHILDREN IN

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS.

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
LAST YEAR MORE THAN 18,000

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
PEOPLE COMMITTED SUICIDE WITH A

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
FIREARM IN THIS COUNTRY.

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
MORE THAN 8,000 WERE MURDERED

129
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WITH GUNS.

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SIMPLY PASSING LAWS AGAINST GUN

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
POSSESSION WILL NOT STOP MASS

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
MURDER.
IT WOULD BE LIKE ENGLAND BANNING

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
KNIVES AFTER JACK THE RIPPER'S

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
KILLING SPREE.

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
U.S. CONSTITUTION ALLOWS

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO ARM

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THEMSELVES, NO QUESTION ABOUT

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT.
BUT WE CAN NOW EXPECT PRESIDENT

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OBAMA TO GET BEHIND LEGISLATION

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THAT WOULD LIMIT WHAT KIND OF

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
FIREARMS THE PUBLIC CAN BUY.

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE, THAT THE

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
FREEDOM?
>> THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING LAST

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
NIGHT IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY HE

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WOULD CALL FOR STRICTER CONTROLS

154
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
ON HEAVY WEAPONS LIKE THE AR 15

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
RIFLE LANZA USED.

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
BUT IT'S CLEAR HE IS HEADING IN

157
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THAT DIRECTION.

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
BUT BEFORE CONGRESS TAKES ANY

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
ACTION, IT SHOULD STUDY THE

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SITUATIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE AND

161
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
RUSSIA WHERE MOST GUNS ARE

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BANNED.
HASN'T CUT DOWN ON GUN VIOLENCE,

163
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
HOWEVER.
AS THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHER

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
MURDER RATE THAN THE USA.

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ALSO THE GUN MURDER RATE HERE IN

166
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AMERICA HAS ALMOST BEEN CUT IN

167
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HALF IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.

168
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
TALKING POINTS WANTS A SANE

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
COUNTRY WITH SMART PUBLIC SAFETY

170
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
MEASURES.
DO WE NEED SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES

171
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
TO BE EASILY AVAILABLE?

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THAT'S A WORTHY DEBATE.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND THERE ARE STRONG POINTS ON

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
EACH SIDE.

175
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
CLEARLY WE THE PEOPLE, HAVE TO

176
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TAKE A TOUGH LOOK AT OUR VIOLENT

177
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SOCIETY AND FIND SOME EFFECTIVE

178
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SOLUTIONS WITHOUT VIOLATING

179
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION, BUT

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WE HAVE TO TRY.

182
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THAT'S A MEMO.

183
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
NOW FOR THE TOP STORY, REACTION.

184
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
JOININGS FROM PHOENIX, ALAN

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
GOTTLIEB, FOUNDER OF THE SECOND

186
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AMENDMENT FOUNDATION, NATIONAL

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RIFLE ASSOCIATION, WOULD NOT

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
PROVIDE, WOULD NOT PROVIDE A

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SPOKESPERSON THIS EVENING.

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY GIVE AT ALL?

191
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
IS THERE ANY AREA THAT YOU WOULD

192
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
COMPROMISE AS FAR AS NEW LAWS

193
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

194
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OBTAIN CERTAIN WEAPONS?

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
>> FIRST, BILL, LET ME SAY I

196
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THOUGHT YOUR TALK POINTS WERE

197
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
REALLY EXCELLENT.

198
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AFFIDAVIT

199
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE DATA HERE, WE BANNED ASSAULT

200
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
RIFLES ONE TIME IN 1994.

201
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE'S STUDY ON

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THAT BAN THAT WAS DONE IN 1999,

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSITY STUDY

205
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

206
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
BERKELEY, HARDLY A BASSTIVE

207
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PRO-GUN RIGHTS THOUGHT, IT

208
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SHOWED IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ON LOWERING HOMICIDE RATES.

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IN FACT, IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

211
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
ON LOWERING MASS MURDERS.

212
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IN FACT, IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IN THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT A

214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
VICTIM WAS SHOT WITH.
SO THE TRUTH IS WE ALREADY KNOW

215
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
IT DOESN'T WORK.

216
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
BUT WHEN WE TRIED IT LAST TIME,

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

218
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE HAD A TEN-YEAR SUPPLY OF ALT

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WEAPONS SOLD IN ONE YEAR BEFORE

220
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THE BAN COULD GO INTO EFFECT AND

221
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHEN IT WAS ENACTED AND BECAME

222
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
EFFECTIVE.

223
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE GOING TO
SEE THAT AGAIN THIS TIME, TOO.

224
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AS EVERYBODY CALLS FOR BANNING

225
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THESE GUN, YOU'LL SEE RECORD

226
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SALES OF THESE FIREARMS.

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S WHAT THE

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
ANTIGUN PEOPLE WANT TO DO.

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU AS

230
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
FAR AS THE STUDY AND THE DATA

231
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AND ALL OF THAT.

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BUT WHY DOES AN INDIVIDUAL NEED

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AN AK 15?

234
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
MAYBE NEEDS NOT THE BEST WORD.

235
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WOULD IT BE BETTER,

236
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MR. GOTTLIEB, FOR AMERICANS TO

237
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

238
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'D LIKE TO HAVE TARGET PRACTICE

239
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WITH THIS AND I'D LIKE TO GO

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HUNTING WITH THAT.

241
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AND IT'S A LIKE

242
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
TO HAVE.
BUT FOR THE GREATER GOOD, I'M

243
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
GOING TO GO ALONG -- THIS IS

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHAT'S COMING DOWN AND YOU KNOW

245
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
IT'S COMING DOWN.

246
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'M GOING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HAND GUNS I SAY NORTH TEXAS

248
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I MEAN, WE NEED -- WE THE PEOPLE

249
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
DOINGNEED THE ABILITY TO PROTECT

250
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OURSELVES.

251
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AN AK 15, I'M NOT SURE WE NEED

252
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THAT.

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> WELL, IT'S AN AK 47 AND AR

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
15, IT'S EASY TO CONFUSE.

255
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> I'M SORRY.
>> I WANT TO GET YOU RIGHT ON

256
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THAT.

257
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WE SAW -- I LIKE TO POINT OUT ON

258
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NATIONAL TELEVISION, WE SAW FILM

259
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
FOOTAGE OF KOREAN MERCHANTS

260
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
USING THESE TYPES OF FIREARMS ON

261
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TOP OF THEIR ROOF TOPS DURING

262
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE L.A. RIOTS SO PLAYER PLACE

263
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OF BUSINESSES WEREN'T LOOTED.

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WE WATCHED DURING HURRICANE

265
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ANDREW PEOPLE USING THESE KIND

266
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OF FIREARMS IN FRONT OF THEIR

267
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HOMES TO STOP LOOTING AFTER THE

268
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
HURRICANE OF THE LITTLE PROPERTY

269
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THEY HAD LEFT.

270
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THEY'RE USING SPORT SHOOTING

271
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HEAVILY.

272
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THESE SPORT UTILITIES --

273
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> SO YOU SAY IN SOME CASES

274
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THEY'RE NEEDED TO DEFEND -- ALL

275
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
RIGHT.
THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT.
NOW, IN AUSTRALIA --

276
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> WELL, GO AHEAD.

277
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> IN AUSTRALIA, THEY DID BAN

278
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND THE

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CRIME RATE PLUMMETED THERE.

280
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AND THEY SAY IN AUSTRALIA, THAT

281
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE PUBLIC

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
POLICY DEAL.

283
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THAT HAPPENED IN 1996.

284
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THEY DID A STUDY AND SAID LOOK,

285
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HAND GUNS, OKAY.

286
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A LITTLE STRICTER THAN HERE, NOT

287
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SO MUCH.

288
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
CANADA, 60 DAYS TO OBTAIN A

289
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
FIREARM THERE.
THEY PUT YOU THROUGH HOOPS.

290
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
YOU GOT TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS

291
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

292
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WOULD EITHER AUSTRALIA OR

293
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
CANADA, THE DATA THERE, 'CAUSE

294
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
MUCH LOWER GUN HOMICIDE RATE IN

295
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
BOTH OF THOSE COUNTRIES -- WOULD

296
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THAT CONVINCE YOU AT ALL?

297
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE IN

298
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AUSTRALIA, WHILE IT WENT DOWN

299
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BAN, WHAT

300
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY IS IT WENT

301
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
BACK UP AGAIN.

302
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THE ANDREW

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
LEE OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

304
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THERE, WHO STUDIED TEN YEARS

305
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HOMICIDES FELL 59% AND SUICIDES

306
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
65%.
SO THAT'S THE LATEST STUDY OUT

307
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OF THERE.

308
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> WELL, MORE RECENT DATA SHOWS

309
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THAT, IN FACT, IT'S COMING WAY

310
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BACK UP AGAIN.

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
PEOPLE ARE ALSO USING OTHER

312
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WEAPONS TO COMMIT CRIMES IF

313
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AUSTRALIA AS WELL.

314
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

315
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT -- IN AUSTRALIA, HERE IT'S

316
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
3.3%.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO WITH THE

317
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
STATS, IT'S WAY BELOW US IN

318
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
AUSTRALIA.

319
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THAT'S JUST A FACT.

320
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
>> THAT IS A FACT.

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
BUT THE UNITED STATES IS A WHOLE

322
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
LOT OF REASONS WHY WE HAVE THE

323
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
VIOLENT CRIME, NOT JUST WITH

324
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
GUNS, BUT OTHER WEAPONS AS WELL.

325
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A LOT OF CULTURAL, ECONOMIC,

326
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
SOCIAL REASONS WHY.

327
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> I SEE THAT.

328
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
AND AUSTRALIA HAS ONLY

329
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
22 MILLION.
WE HAVE 320 PEOPLE.

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
CANADA, AGAIN, THEY HAVE

331
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
35 MILLION PEOPLE.

332
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BUT WOULDN'T IT MAKE A LITTLE

333
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BIT MORE SENSE JUST TO TIGHTEN

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT?

335
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I AM A SECOND AMENDMENT GUY.

336
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AND I KNOW WHAT THE FOUNDING

337
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
FATHERS' INTENT WAS.

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THEY WANTED AMERICANS TO BE ABLE

339
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

340
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE ISN'T ANY QUESTION ABOUT

341
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
IT.
BUT I THINK WE CAN TIGHTEN IT UP

342
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A LITTLE, MR. GOTTLIEB.

343
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.

344
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
>> BILL, LIKE YOU SAID IN YOUR

345
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TALKING POINTS, NEW GUN LAWS

346
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WOULDN'T PROBABLY STOP A CRIME

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY

348
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WON'T.

349
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
HE BROKE AT LEAST 41 LAWS TO

350
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
BEGIN WITH.

351
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
PROBLEM HERE IS MENTAL HEALTH

352
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES NEED

353
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
TO BE UPDATED AND CHANGED SO

354
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THESE PEOPLE GET THE TREATMENT

355
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THEY NEED AND THEY'RE NOT WALK

356
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
AROUND --

357
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> DID HE NOT DO ANYTHING IN 20

358
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
YEARS THAT WOULD HAVE WARRANTED

359
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
ANY KIND OF COMPULSORY MENTAL

360
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
HEALTH INTERVENTION ON HIS PART.

361
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SO AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME THING.

362
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

363
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
>> OUR RESEARCH SHOWS IT RIGHT

364
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
NOW.
NEW STUFF COULD COME IN, BUT

365
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
RIGHT NOW THERE WASN'T ANYTHING

366
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THIS MAN DID IN 20 YEARS THAT

367
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WOULD HAVE WARRANTED --

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
>> YOU'RE TALKING POINTS, YOU

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
REFERENCED HE WAS PRETTY
ANTISOCIAL AND DIDN'T QUITE FIT

370
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
IN.
>> THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

371
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
>> THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS.

372
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> YEAH.
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING SOCIAL, IT

373
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
WOULDN'T BE ON TV, THAT'S JUST

374
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000

395
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
EVERY TIME YOU PULL OUT YOUR

FAMILY PROTECTED.

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000

VIOLENCE, JOINING US, MARY

460
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
KATHERINE HAM AND JUAN WILLIAMS.

461
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE AUDIENCE FOR

462
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
MIXING UP AN AK AND AR 15.

463
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'M NOT A GUN GUY, BUT I'M NOT

464
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
TOTALLY IGNORANT ABOUT THE

465
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ISSUE, IT'S JUST THAT -- I MADE

466
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
A MISTAKE.

467
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SO NOW I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT, BUT

468
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

469
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
JUAN, YOU HEARD THE DISCUSSION.

470
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
YOU HEARD THE TALKING POINTS.

471
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'M PUTTING YOU IN CHARGE NOW.

472
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
YOU'RE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TOP

473
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
ADVISOR ON THIS ISSUE.

474
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YOU TELL HIM TO DO WHAT?

475
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
>> YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, I

476
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TONE

477
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
TONIGHT.
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE AMERICA'S

478
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
HEART BECAUSE THIS IS CHRISTMAS

479
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
SEASON AND THE IDEA OF THOSE

480
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
LITTLE KIDS --

481
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
>> Bill: WE WANT TO PROTECT THE

482
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
KIDS ON EVERY LEVEL AND IF WE

483
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
HAVE TO ALL SACRIFICE A LITTLE

484
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
BIT, I THINK WE SHOULD.

485
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE.

486
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
MR. GOTTLIEB WAS AN EXCELLENT

487
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
GUEST, BY THE WAY.

488
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
HE PUT FORTH HIS POINT OF VIEW

489
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
WITH FACTS, NOT EMOTION.

490
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WASN'T SOME WINGO GUY.

491
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
YOU GOT TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

492
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> I DO.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT

493
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WHEN YOU CITED THOSE NUMBERS

494
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN LEVELS

495
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
OF HOMICIDE BY GUN IN THE U.S.,

496
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
AUSTRALIA, AND YOU CAN LOOK AT

497
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

498
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
YOU MENTIONED CANADA.

499
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
IT'S SIMILAR.

500
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THE THREE THINGS I WOULD DO

501
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
RIGHT AWAY, ONE IS I THINK THE

502
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE FREE TO

503
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
SHARE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF

504
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

505
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THE GUY THAT DID THE SHOOTING IN

506
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
VIRGINIA, VIRGINIA TECH, THAT

507
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
STATE JUDGE HAD FOUND HIM

508
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
MENTALLY INCOMPETENT.

509
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
BUT GUESS WHAT?

510
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SELLING GUNS

511
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

512
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
INFORMATION.
>> Bill: BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR A

513
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
MASSIVE BUREAUCRACY OF

514
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
360 MILLION PEOPLE.

515
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> NO I'M NOT.

516
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
>> Bill: I WANT INFORMATION TO

517
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
BE SHARED AS WELL.

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> OKAY.
>> Bill: IF YOU THINK THIS KIND

519
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
OF A SYSTEM OF INFORMATION

520
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
SHARING IS GOING TO WORK AT ALL

521
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
LEVELS, IT'S JUST NOT.

522
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
>> I THINK IT COULD.

523
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I THINK IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

524
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
YOU SAID LET'S TAKE SMALL STEPS.

525
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
LET'S DO THINGS WE AGREE ON.

526
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
>> Bill: THE THING IS THE AR 15.

527
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I MEAN, DO WE PUT RESTRICTIONS

528
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
LIKE AUSTRALIA HAS, CANADA HAS.

529
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
BRITAIN DOESN'T HAVE ANY GUNS.

530
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY GUNS THERE.

531
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
>> OKAY.
THE SECOND THING IS BACKGROUND

532
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
CHECKS.
RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE AN

533
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
UNLICENSED GUN DEALER, YOU'RE A

534
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
COLLECTOR, YOU CAN SELL A GUN TO

535
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ANYBODY WITHOUT ANY CHECKS.

536
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE STRINGENT

537
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
ENFORCEMENT OF BACKGROUND

538
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
CHECKS.
>> Bill: CAN DID HAS THAT.

539
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
60-DAY WAITING PERIOD.

540
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
IN THIS CASE, LANZA'S MOTHER

541
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
BOUGHT THE GUNS.

542
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> RIGHT.
NO BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE WORLD

543
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
WOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM.

544
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS PART OF

545
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THAT BACKGROUND SHOULD BE A FULL

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
FAMILY CHECK.
>> Bill: YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL

547
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
FAMILY CHECK, JUAN!

548
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THAT'S --
>> WHY NOT?

549
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
>> Bill: THAT'S AN INVASION OF

550
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
PRIVACY!
>> I THINK THERE'S A RIGHT TO

551
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECTING OUR

552
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
CHILDREN -- DID SHE.
>> Bill: WE'LL KICK IN

553
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
EVERYBODY'S DOOR AND LOOK AT --

554
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.

555
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
>> Bill: THAT'S PIE IN THE SKY.

556
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
YOU SAY WHAT, MARY KATHERINE?

557
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> I SAY NOBODY HAS YET POINTED

558
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
OUT THE LAW THAT WOULD HAVE

559
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
PREHAVE NOTED THIS INCIDENT.

560
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IF IT WERE THAT EASY, WE WOULD

561
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
PROBABLY PASS THAT LAW.

562
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
BUT FOR INSTANCE, CONNECTICUT

563
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
AND NEW JERSEY, THE PLACE WHERE

564
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
IS THESE GUYS MAY HAVE BEEN

565
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BUYING OR HANGING OUT, OR THE

566
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
PERPETRATOR WAS, HAVE SOME OF

567
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THE STRICTER GUN LAWS.

568
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THERE IS AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

569
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
IN CONNECTICUT, LIKE THE 1994

570
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
ONE.
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW NATIONALLY

571
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ENFORCED ONE WOULD CHANGE THE

572
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
FACT BECAUSE AN AR 15 WHICH WAS

573
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
LEGAL UNDER THAT BAN.

574
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SO I'M JUST CONCERNED, I THINK

575
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
YOU WERE VERY RIGHT, BILL, TO

576
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
POINT OUT WHEN WE'RE REACTING AS

577
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SOCIETY, IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE'RE

578
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
NOT CARING.
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
FREEDOMS WHICH WE PRIZE VERY

580
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HIGHLY.
>> Bill: THAT'S RIGHT.

581
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

582
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WE HAVE A STRUCTURE HERE.

583
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION HERE

584
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN GREAT

585
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
BRITAIN AND CANADA.

586
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AND THERE IS A REASON FOR IT.

587
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
HISTORICALLY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

588
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
IMMEDIATE PROBLEM.
THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS

589
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BASICALLY THAT YOU, ANY

590
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AMERICAN, CAN GET A

591
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE OR PISTOL

592
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
AND ALL THE ROUNDS YOU WANT AND

593
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
YOU CAN GET IT IN CONNECTICUT --

594
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
LOOK, CHICAGO IS THE TOUGHEST

595
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
GUN LAWS AND THEY'RE GUNNING

596
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
PEOPLE DOWN LIKE FIVE OR SIX A

597
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
DAY.

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
>> THE EVIDENCE IS THAT DOESN'T

599
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
WORK.
I WOULD ADD ALSO THERE WAS

600
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
LEGISLATION PASSED IN THE WAKE

601
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
OF THE VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE

602
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WHICH ALLOWED STATES AND THE

603
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SHARE THAT

604
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION.

605
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I DO BELIEVE IT CAN BE A CIVIL

606
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
LINTS ISSUE OR CAN BE A

607
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
BUREAUCRATIC MESS.

608
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
BUT THAT WAS ALREADY PASSED.

609
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
>> Bill: IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S ADVISOR, WOULD YOU

610
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
ADVISE HIM TO DO ANYTHING, PUT

611
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
FORTH ANY NEW LEGISLATION?

612
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
>> I THINK SOME DISCUSSION OF,

613
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
LIKE, THE TWEAKING OF THE

614
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
INTERSECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH

615
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
AND OWNING GUNS COULD BE

616
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
HELPFUL, LIKE I SAID IN THE WAKE

617
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
OF THIS PAST ONE, SOMETHING

618
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
PASSED AND IT WAS SUPPORTED BY

619
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN AND THE NRA.

620
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
SO YOU CAN COME TOGETHER ON

621
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
THESE THINGS.

622
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY

623
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
CAREFUL.
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE

624
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THAT THESE LAWS STOP THESE

625
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THINGS.

626
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
THESE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE INTENT ON

627
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
DOING THEM.

628
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST NOT

629
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
TRUE.
>> YOU'RE TAKING AWAY OTHER

630
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
PEOPLE'S ABILITIES TO DEFEND

631
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THEMSELVES.

632
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> MARY KATHERINE, IF YOU'RE

633
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SELLING GUNS IN THE WOODS OF

634
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
VERGE, BELIEVE ME, THERE BECOMES

635
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
A PIPELINE TO THE CITIES  THAT

636
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
LEADS TO THIS KIND OF CARNAGE

637
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
AND I THINK WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE

638
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TO HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

639
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
AND STOP SELLING THESE LARGE --

640
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
>> Bill: I GOT TO GO.

641
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.

642
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
>> BE HONEST ABOUT THE FACT

643
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

644
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
IN AUSTRALIA, THEY TOOK GUNS

645
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AWAY FROM PEOPLE --

646
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
>> Bill: HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!

647
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> YOU OVERREACT.
>> Bill: HOLD IT.

648
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

649
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
UNIFORM THING OF ALL 50 STATES

650
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ABOUT WHO YOU SELL TO AND

651
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS.

652
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
BUT JUAN, THE THING ABOUT THE

653
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC BAN, 300 MILLION

654
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
GUNS HERE.

655
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
AS MR. GOTTLIEB POINTED OUT,

656
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BUY THEM AND

657
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THEY'RE AROUND AND THE BAD GUYS

658
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM AND THE

659
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
GOOD GUYS AREN'T.

660
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> YOU JUST CAN'T CURSE THE

661
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
NIGHT.
YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING, BILL.

662
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
>> NOT IF IT DOESN'T WORK AND IF

663
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
YOU'RE IMPEDING OTHER PEOPLE.

664
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
>> Bill: RIGHT.

665
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
YOU DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

666
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
VERY INTERESTING DEBATE, YOU

667
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
GUYS.
DIRECTLY AHEAD, WE'LL TAKE TO

668
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
YOU CONNECTICUT WHERE BILL

669
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
HEMMER IS REPORT AGO COMMUNITY

670
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
IN AGONY.

671
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
HE'S BEEN THERE ALL WEEKEND.

672
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
WE WILL UPDATE YOU ON THAT

673
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
AMERICAN MARINE BEING HELD IN A

674
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
MEXICAN PRISON.

675
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THOSE REPORTS AFTER THESE

676
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
MESSAGES

677
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> Bill: PERSONAL STORY SEGMENT,

678
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
ALMOST EVERY PERSON I TALK WITH
OVER THE WEEKEND WAS DEVASTATED

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BY THE MURDERS IN NEWTOWN,

680
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
CONNECTICUT.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE

681
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
IN THAT TOWN THIS EVENING.

682
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
JOININGS FROM THE SCENE, FOX

683
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
NEWS ANCHOR BILL HEMMER.

684
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

685
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
TO YOU THAT YOU SAW TODAY?

686
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> WOW.

687
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I GUESS WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT

688
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THE KILLER.

689
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I GUESS WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT

690
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE

691
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
KILLER'S MOTHER.

692
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
LET'S TAKE THE FIRST THING.

693
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WHAT I AM TOLD IS THAT ADAM

694
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
LANZA WAS WELL-KNOWN IN THIS

695
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
TOWN OF SANDY HOOK.

696
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
HE WAS ALWAYS THE KIND OF PERSON

697
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
WHO JUST DID NOT FIT IN.

698
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME

699
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THAT HE WOULD STOP ON A SIDEWALK

700
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AND STARE AT YOU AND STARE AT

701
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
YOU AND STARE AT YOU MORE UNTIL

702
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
YOU WENT AND PASSED BY.

703
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
SOCIAL SETTINGS, HE RARELY, IF

704
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
EVER, TALKED.

705
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A

706
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TEEN-AGER GROWING UP HERE

707
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
ENCOUNTERING THIS YOUNG MAN, HOW

708
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
DO YOU REACT AND RESPOND TO HIM?

709
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
PART OF THAT, I THINK, HELPED TO

710
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
PUSH HIM FURTHER INTO ISOLATION.

711
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THIS POINT IS KEY, BILL.

712
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HE HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

713
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
NONE.

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
EVER THAT THE POLICE TOLD US

715
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
TODAY.
>> Bill: RIGHT.

716
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
THAT'S A S TOWN.

717
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
IF HE WERE CAUSING TROUBLE ON

718
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ANY LEVEL, BUT YOU CAN'T ARREST

719
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
SOMEONE FOR STARING AT YOU.

720
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
HE WAS A WEIRDO.

721
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THERES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

722
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
AND NOW WE FIND OUT HE WAS

723
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE NET,

724
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
WHICH IS ALWAYS A PROVOCATIVE

725
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
SITUATION.

726
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WHAT IT YOU LEARN ABOUT THE

727
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
MOTHER?
>> THE MOTHER, REMEMBER ON

728
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
FRIDAY WHEN THERE WERE ALL THESE

729
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
REPORTS SHE WAS A TEACHER AT THE

730
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
SCHOOL AND THAT --

731
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
>> Bill: THEY WEREN'T TRUE.

732
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> SHE NEVER TAUGHT HERE.

733
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
NOW THEY'RE SAYING HE HAD NO

734
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

735
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
HOWEVER, AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE

736
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
STRONGLY CONNECTED TO THE POLICE

737
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
DEPARTMENT HERE IN NEWTOWN TELL

738
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ME THAT SHE VOLUNTEERED AT THE

739
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SCHOOL.

740
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
NOW, DID SHE TEACH THESE KIDS IN

741
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
THAT FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM?

742
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THAT'S NOT CONFIRMED.

743
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
HOW OFTEN DID SHE DO IT?

744
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
WHAT CLASS DID SHE TEACH?

745
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
WE CANNOT SAY.

746
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
BUT SHE APPARENTLY DID HAVE A

747
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
CONNECTION AND THAT WAS THROUGH

748
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THE VOLUNTEER WORK SHE DID.

749
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I MENTIONED THAT, BILL, 'CAUSE

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
THAT COULD BE A CRITICAL POINT

751
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
OF EVIDENCE IN TRYING TO TIE THE

752
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
SHOOTER TO THE SCHOOL BEHIND ME

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
HERE.
>> Bill: THE FUNERALS HAVE

754
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
BEGUN, WHICH JUST MAKES

755
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
EVERYTHING -- COMPOUNDS THE

756
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
GRIEF.

757
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WATCHING FOX NEWS ALL DAY TODAY,

759
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE TOWN IS HANDLING IT AS WELL

760
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AS ANYBODY COULD HANDLE IT,

761
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
RIGHT?
THERE ISN'T ANY KIND OF LASHING

762
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
OUT OR ACTING OUT.

763
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THERE IS NONE OF THAT.

764
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEY'RE VERY DIGNIFIED PEOPLE.

765
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
>> YEAH.
SO FAR I AGREE WITH YOU

766
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ENTIRELY.

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU KNOW THE STAGES.

768
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SHOCK AND THEN GRIEF.

769
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THEY'RE IN GRIEF NOW.

770
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
THEN IT'S ANGER.

771
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY SEEN

772
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THE THIRD PHASE OF THAT.

773
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT SOME

774
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO

775
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 9:30 IN THE

776
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
MORNING, ONE WAS A U.S. MARINE

777
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
WHO SERVED TWO TOURS OF DUTY IN

778
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AFGHANISTAN.
HE'S IN HIS MID 20S.

779
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
HE'S NOT TALKING YET AND PERHAPS

780
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WILL NOT FOR SOME TIME.

781
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
HE IS TELLING HIS CLOSE FRIENDS,

782
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
BILL, THAT WHAT HE FOUND INSIDE

783
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
THAT CLASSROOM, FAR EXCEEDS

784
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
ANYTHING HE SAW IN WAR IN

785
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AFGHANISTAN, THE MOUNTAINS OF

786
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THE DESERTS OF THAT COUNTRY,

787
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
OVER TWO DIFFERENT TOURS OF

788
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
DUTY.
YOU IMAGINE THE HELP THAT MAN IS

789
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
GOING TO NEED FOR THE REST OF

790
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HIS LIFE BASED ON WHAT HE SAW

791
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
INSIDE.
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO PASS

792
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ON TO YOU AND YOUR VIEWERS,

793
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
BILL, LATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT, I

794
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
WAS IN ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS

795
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
HERE AFTER A LONG DAY OF WORK.

796
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THE WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO ME,

797
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY INCONSOLABLE,

798
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
BILL.
I MEAN, THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN

799
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
HER FACE AND LOOKING AT US AND

800
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TELLING, YOU'RE CRYING JUST AS

801
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
MUCH AS I AM.
YOU'RE HURTING JUST AS MUCH AS I

802
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
AM.

803
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
AND I PUT MY ARM AROUND HER AND

804
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I SAID, LOOK, AMERICA IS CRYING

805
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
WITH YOU.
BUT THEN THE MAN NOKES TO HER,

806
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
HE WAS JUST STARING OFF IN THAT

807
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
100-YARD STARE WITH TEARS

808
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
ROLLING DOWN HIS FACE AND THE

809
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
WOMAN NEXT TO HIM DOING THE SAME

810
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THING.

811
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THEN WE'D WALK OUT.
ANOTHER GROUP CAME IN AND THEY

812
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WERE DOING THE SAME THING.

813
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THIS IS A TOWN IN ABSOLUTE

814
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
MOURNING.
IT IS A TOWN YET AGAIN THAT YOU

815
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
FIND IN TEARS.

816
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
TWO MORE FUNERALS TOMORROW,

817
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
BILL.
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

818
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME
FOLLOW-UP REPORTING ON THE

819
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED AND THERE

820
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
ARE GOING TO BE GRIEF

821
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
COUNSELORRERS THERE AND THE

822
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND THE

823
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
GOVERNOR DOING A GREAT JOB.

824
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THEY'RE ALL GOING TO MOBILIZE TO

825
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
HELP EVERYBODY.

826
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
WE APPRECIATE T. THANK YOU VERY

827
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
MUCH.
PLENTY MORE AHEAD AS "THE

828
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
FACTOR" MOVES ALONG.

829
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WE'LL UPDATE YOU ON THE FORMER

830
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
MARINE INCARCERATED IN THE

831
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
FILTHY MEXICAN PRISON FOR

832
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
ABSOLUTELY TO REASON.

833
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
YOU CAN SEE HIM CHAINED.

834
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
PUTTING PRESSURE ON OUR

835
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
GOVERNMENT TO GET HIM RELEASED.

836
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
THEN BERNIE GOLDBERG ON SOME FAR

837
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
LEFT PUNDITS EXPLOITING THE

838
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
AWFUL SITUATION IN CONNECTICUT.

839
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
WE HOPE YOU STAY TUNED TO THOSE

840
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
REPORTS

841
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> Bill: FACTOR FOLLOW-UP.

842
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
JON HAMMER PROUDLY SERVED IN

843
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN REMAINS

844
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
INCARCERATED IN MEXICO TONIGHT.

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
HIS MOTHER SENT US THIS PICTURE

846
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TODAY SHOWING CORPORAL HAMMAR

847
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
CHAINED TO HIS PRISON BED, JUST

848
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
ACROSS THE BORROWED PROSECUTOR

849
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS.

850
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
AS WE REPORTED LAST WEEK, HE IS

851
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BEING HELD ON A BOGUS GUN

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
CHARGE.
LAST AUGUST HE REGISTERED AN

853
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
ANTIQUE FIREARM WITH U.S.

854
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
CUSTOMS, THEN CROSSED THE BORDER

855
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TO CHECK IN WITH MEXICAN

856
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OFFICIALS CARRYING PAPERWORK.

857
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
THEY PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM AND

858
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT
BEEN ABLE TO GET HIM RELEASED.

859
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THE CORPORAL WAS TAKING THE GUN

860
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
O COSTA RICA ON A HUNTING TRIP.

861
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
JOININGS FROM CALIFORNIA ON THE

862
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
PHONE, JEREMY CANOE, BEEN

863
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
NEARLY -- SPENT THREE YEARS IN A

864
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
MEXICAN PRISON ON A DRUG CHARGE.

865
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH STEROIDS,

866
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
CORRECT?

867
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
>> YES.

868
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
>> Bill: AND YOU KNEW THAT BEING

869
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
DOWN THERE WITH THIS KIND OF A

870
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
SITUATION YOU WERE PUTTING

871
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
YOURSELF IN BIG-TIME RISK?

872
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Bill: AND THEN WHEN THEY

873
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
CAUGHT YOU AND YOU WERE

874
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SENTENCED TO PRISON, WHAT DID

875
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
YOU FACE IN PRISON?

876
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
WHAT WAS IT LIKE THERE?

877
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
>> TO SUM IT UP FOR YOU, IT WAS

878
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
HELL.
THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THERE

879
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
WERE BARELY UNLIVABLE.

880
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THE PRISON I WAS IN WAS BUILT

881
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
FOR 400 PEOPLE.

882
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THERE WAS ACTUALLY 1200 PEOPLE

883
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
IN THERE.

884
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I WALKED INTO THE PRISON AND

885
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THEY PUT ME BACK INTO A ROOM

886
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WITH 60 OTHER MEXICAN PRISONERS

887
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
AND THEY DON'T GIVE YOU NO

888
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
BLANKET OR PILLOW.

889
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ANY CLOTHES,

890
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
NO TOOTHBRUSH, TOILET PAPER,

891
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
NOTHING.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY GIVEN NOTHING.

892
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
YOU'RE JUST BASICALLY THROWN IN

893
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THERE LIKE AN ANIMAL.

894
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

895
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> Bill: WHAT WAS THE STRUCTURE?

896
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WERE THERE GUARDS, A WARDEN?

897
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
WAS THERE EXERCISE?

898
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
FOOD?

899
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
WHAT WAS ALL THAT?

900
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
>> NEVER SAW THE WARDEN.

901
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THERE WERE -- YES, THERE WERE

902
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
GUARDS THERE.

903
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THE GUARDS THERE WERE MOST OF

904
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THEM WERE PRETTY CORRUPT.

905
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY WOULD BRING YOU ANYTHING

906
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THAT YOU BASICALLY WANTED INTO

907
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THE PRISON.

908
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IF YOU WANTED MONEY BROUGHT IN

909
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
OR FOR SOME PEOPLE DRUGS AND

910
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
STUFF LIKE THAT.

911
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS AT

912
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
6:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING,

913
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THEY WOULD OPEN UP THE CELLS.

914
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
EVERYONE WENT O A BIG FREE FOR

915
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
ALL ALL DAY LONG, RUNNING AROUND

916
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THE PRISON.

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID, THERE WAS

918
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
11, 1200 PEOPLE IN THERE AT A

919
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
TIME.
SO THE STATISTICS IN THERE WERE

920
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
800 PEOPLE OUT OF THE 11 OR 1200

921
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
WERE ALL DRUG ADDICTS.

922
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
>> Bill: THE GUARD WOULD SELL

923
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THE PRISONERS DRUGS, NARCOTICS.

924
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Bill: HOW ABOUT THE VIOLENCE

925
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
LEVEL?
>> WELL, ON A DAILY BASIS, THERE

926
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WERE FIGHTS.

927
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I SAW A COUPLE MURDERS.

928
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
A COUPLE GUYS STABBED TO DEATH.

929
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS IN A

930
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
COUPLE OF FIGHTS AND WAS STABBED

931
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES THERE IN THE

932
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PRISON, JUST BASICALLY OVER

933
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
MONEY.

934
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> Bill: DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
GOG DIE IN THERE?

935
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
>> OH, YES.

936
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I HONESTLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND

937
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I PRAYED -- I COULDN'T TELL YOU

938
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HOW MANY PRAYERS I SAID WHILE I

939
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WAS THERE INN THERE, LORD, JUST

940
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

941
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
IT WASN'T AN EVERYDAY PRAYER.

942
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
IT WAS AN ALL-DAY LONG PRAYER.

943
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
GOD, PLEASE JUST GET ME OUT OF

944
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HERE ALIVE.

945
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
>> Bill: HOW DID THEY GET YOU

946
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
OUT?

947
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
HOW DID YOU FINALLY GET OUT?

948
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> WELL, AFTER THREE DIFFERENT

949
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
LAWYERS AND PAIN, THESE THREE

950
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
DIFFERENT LAWYERS, 70 TO $80,000

951
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
IN AMERICAN MONEY, NONE OF

952
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THESE -- ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY

953
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
GOT ONE OF THE CHARGES DROPPED.

954
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
BUT I'M STILL CHARGED WITH

955
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED

956
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
SUBSTANCE.
AND AFTER 70, $80,000, THEY ALL

957
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN.

958
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I ACTUALLY AM THANKFUL TO MY

959
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
AUNT, MY AUNT CONSISTENTLY

960
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
CALLED THE UNITED STATES

961
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
CONSULATE.
AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME OF

962
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CALLING THEM AND CALLING THEM

963
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AND CALLING THEM, THEY TOLD ME I

964
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
COULD PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER AND

965
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER.

966
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
TWO YEARS, 2 1/2 YEARS AFTER I

967
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
WAS IN THERE.
AFTER I DID PUT IN THE TRANSFER,

968
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I GOT TRANSFERRED OUT OF THERE

969
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BY THE UNITED STATES CONSULATE.

970
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> Bill: SO THEY GOT YOU OUT OF

971
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THE COUNTRY?

972
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> THEY GOT ME OUT OF THE

973
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
COUNTRY.

974
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> Bill: AFTER ALL THE PRESSURE

975
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAT YOUR AUNT PUT ON THEM.

976
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO

977
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HAPPEN IN THE CASE OF CORPORAL

978
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HAMMAR AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO PUT

979
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THE PRESSURE ON.

980
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
JEREMY, THANKS VERY MUCH.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

981
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, BERNIE

982
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
GOLDBERG ON PUNISH EXPLOITING

983
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE CONNECTICUT SITUATION FOR

984
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
POLITICAL REASONS.

985
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THEN WHY IS AMERICA SO VIOLENT?

986
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
WE'LL HAVE A DISTURBING ANALYSIS

987
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND WE'LL

988
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
BE RIGHT

989
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> Bill: THANKS FOR STAYING WITH
US.

990
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'M BILL O'REILLY.
BERNIE SEGMENT.

991
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
ON FRIDAY, IT JUST TOOK MINUTES,

992
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
MINUTES FOR SOME PEOPLE ON MSNBC

993
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
AND OTHER LIB RAT OUTLETS TO

994
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
DIRECT THE STORY IN CONNECTICUT

995
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
FROM THE HORROR TO GUN CONTROL.

996
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GUN

997
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE

998
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
NOT TALKING ABOUT SECOND

999
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1000
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WE'RE TALKING AS I WAS
DISCUSSING WITH THE BRADY

1001
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS YESTERDAY,

1002
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
ABOUT REASONABLE BACKGROUND

1003
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
CHECKS, REASONABLE CONTROLS,

1004
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY AND AMMO,

1005
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
MULTIPLE ROUNDS THAT CAUSE THE

1006
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
GREATEST AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE.

1007
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> Bill: JOINING US FROM MIAMI,

1008
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
MR. GOLDBERG.
WE DIDN'T DO THIS ON FRIDAY.

1009
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SAW

1010
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
FRIDAY'S FACTOR.

1011
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
BUT WE HAD THE HIGHEST RATING,

1012
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AS USUAL, ON THE CABLE NEWS

1013
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
UNIVERSE.

1014
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
WE HAVE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT

1015
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
POLITICAL STUFF.

1016
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> RIGHT.

1017
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
>> Bill: BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T

1018
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
APPROPRIATE, YOU KNOW.

1019
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
>> RIGHT.

1020
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> Bill: THE FOLKS WANTED TO

1021
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
THEY WANTED THE FACTS AS FAR AS

1022
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
WE KNEW.

1023
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND THEY WANTED TO SEE THE

1024
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
REACTION OF THE PEOPLE ON THE

1025
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SCENE.
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY OF THIS

1026
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
POLITICAL STUFF.

1027
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
NOW THREE DAYS LATER YOU CAN GET

1028
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
INTO IT.

1029
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
SO WHEN I SAW THAT, I JUST WENT,

1030
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY

1031
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
MATTER WHAT IT IS, THEIR

1032
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
POLITICAL AGENDA OVERRIDES EVERY

1033
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
HUMANISTIC CONCERN.

1034
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
AM I WRONG?

1035
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT,

1036
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
UNFORTUNATELY.
THERE SHOULD BE A REASONABLE

1037
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE SIMPLY

1038
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
MOURN.
TELEVISION IS OUR NATIONAL

1039
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
CATHEDRAL.
IT'S WHERE WE ALL GO WHEN THERE

1040
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IS AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY.

1041
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WE GO THERE TO GRIEVE TOGETHER

1042
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
AND TO WITNESS WHAT'S GOING ON

1043
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
TOGETHER.

1044
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THERE SHOULD BE NO POLITICS.

1045
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
AS YOU SAID, IT TOOK MINUTES FOR

1046
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
SOME ON THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA

1047
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
TO START IN WITH THEIR GUN

1048
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
AGENDA.
BUT CONSERVATIVE MEDIA ALSO USED

1049
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
THE TRAGEDY AND THE MEDIA TO

1050
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
FURTHER THEIR AGENDA.

1051
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>> Bill: HOW DID THEY DO THAT?

1052
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
>> I'LL GIVE TWO EXAMPLES.

1053
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW WE TOOK

1054
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
GOD OUT OF THE CLASSROOM, OUT OF

1055
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THE SCHOOL ROOM, SO WE SHOULDN'T

1056
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
BE SURPRISED WHEN THERE IS

1057
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
CARNAGE IN THE SCHOOLS.

1058
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> Bill: I GOT LETTERS SAYING

1059
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
THAT.
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW WE

1060
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
HAVE A MILLION ABORTIONS A YEAR,

1061
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
CHEAPENS LIFE, AND THAT

1062
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SOMEHOW THIS IS RELATED TO WHAT

1063
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
HAPPENED.

1064
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
INDIRECTLY, BUT SOMEHOW RELATED.

1065
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU

1066
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
SOMETHING --
>> LET ME JUST SAY, THIS BILL.

1067
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
AS IF AN INSANE GUNMAN, AN

1068
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
INSANE MENTALLY UNSTABLE GUNMAN

1069
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
CARES ABOUT GOD AND THE

1070
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
CLASSROOM OR ABORTION.

1071
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
WE KNOW HE DOESN'T.

1072
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> Bill: OKAY.

1073
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I DON'T THINK HE WAS INSANE, BY

1074
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THE WAY.
I THINK HE KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG

1075
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE KILLED

1076
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
HIMSELF.

1077
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

1078
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
>> Bill: OKAY.
NOW, I DIDN'T SEE THAT LEVEL

1079
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
OF -- I GOT LETTERS SAYING WHAT

1080
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
DO YOU EXPECT?

1081
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
YOU TAKE GOD OUT OF THE

1082
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
CLASSROOM AND WE'RE A SOCIETY

1083
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THAT DOESN'T VALUE RIGHT AND

1084
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
WRONG ANYMORE.

1085
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
BUT I DIDN'T SEE THAT --

1086
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THE

1087
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

1088
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

1089
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
>> YES, IT DID.

1090
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
YES, IT DID.
>> Bill: I DIDN'T SEE IT.

1091
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> YEAH.
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

1092
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
>> HAPPENED ON THE FOX NEWS

1093
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
CHANNEL.

1094
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
>> Bill: WAS IT FRONT AND

1095
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
CENTER?
'CAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THIS

1096
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
PROGRAM AND I WAS WATCHING PRIME

1097
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
TIME AND I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF

1098
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
THAT.

1099
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
>> WELL, NO.
THERE IS MORE OF IT ON THE LEFT

1100
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
BECAUSE -- LOOK, EVERYBODY IN

1101
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
THE MEDIA HAS A ROLE.

1102
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE THING.

1103
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THAT'S WHY I'M DISGUSTED WITH

1104
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
BOTH SIDES.

1105
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
EVERYBODY HAS A ROLE IN THE

1106
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
MEDIA.
SO THE LEFT IMMEDIATELY,

1107
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
IMMEDIATELY --
>> Bill: BAN GUNS.

1108
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

1109
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
LET'S NOT LET ANY TRAGEDY GO TO

1110
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
WASTE.

1111
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
SO THEY IMMEDIATELY JUMP ON THIS

1112
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
TO FURTHER THE AGENDA THAT

1113
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THEY'VE GOT ABOUT GUNS.

1114
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
AN AGENDA, BY THE WAY, WHEN IT

1115
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
COMES TO ASSAULT WEAPONS, I'LL

1116
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SAY IT, KEEP THE LETTERS -- I

1117
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU --

1118
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
THAT I AGREE WITH.

1119
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I DON'T THINK WE NEED ASSAULT

1120
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
WEAPONS IN OUR CULTURE.

1121
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND

1122
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
AMENDMENT.
I'M NOT ANTIGUN.

1123
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
BUT I THINK WE DON'T NEED THAT.

1124
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
BUT THE RIGHT ALSO JUMPS ON

1125
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THESE THINGS TO FURTHER ITS

1126
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
AGENDA.
BILL, I WROTE A COLUMN ON MY WEB

1127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SITE TODAY.

1128
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT THE

1129
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF

1130
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

1131
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WALKING TIME BOMBS WHO SIMPLY

1132
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, THEY

1133
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
SEEM ODD.
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE

1134
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
PEOPLE?

1135
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
AND I MENTIONED IN THIS COLUMN

1136
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THAT I WAS ALSO IN FAVOR OF A

1137
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1138
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE COMMENT

1139
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
AFTERWARD DIDN'T MENTION THE

1140
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
MENTAL ILLNESS PART,  WHICH IS

1141
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
WHAT THE COLUMN WAS ABOUT.

1142
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
THEY WANT ASSAULT WEAPONS AND

1143
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
YOU KNOW WHY?

1144
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE BIG

1145
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
NAMES AND CONSERVATIVE MEDIA

1146
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO SAY OUT

1147
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
LOUD.

1148
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
YOU KNOW WHY THEY WANT ASSAULT

1149
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WEAPONS?
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO PROCEED

1150
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THEY CAN'T SELVES FROM COMMON

1151
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
CRIMINALS.
THEY WANT IT TO PROTECT

1152
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
THEMSELVES FROM THE FEDERAL

1153
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
GOVERNMENT.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

1154
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
>> Bill: ALSO A LEVEL OF

1155
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
PARANOIA ON THE FAR RIGHT THAT

1156
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW.

1157
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THE FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THAT

1158
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
CLAUSE IN THERE BECAUSE THERE

1159
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WAS FEAR BACK THEN THAT THE

1160
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
GOVERNMENT WOULD TURN OPPRESSIVE

1161
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
AND THAT'S A HISTORIC FACT.

1162
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
>> THEY THINK BARAK OBAMA WANTS
TO TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY AND THAT

1163
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
HE'S GOING TO SEND TROOPS INTO

1164
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THEIR HOMES.

1165
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
>> Bill: IF BARAK OBAMA SENDS

1166
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
TROOPS INTO THE HOMES, THE

1167
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS IS NOT GOING TO

1168
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
HELP THEM.

1169
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

1170
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
TO GO INTO THE HOME NO MATTER

1171
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
WHAT THEY HAVE.
MY TALKING POINTS I TRIED TO BE

1172
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
FAIR.
AND I TRIED TO PUT FORTH A CALM

1173
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
DOWN EVERYBODY, LET'S WORK ON

1174
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
THIS PROBLEM SEE IF WE CAN FIND

1175
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
A SOLUTION THAT ACTUAL HEE

1176
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
WORKS.
I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL HERE.

1177
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.
UP NEXT, WHY IS AMERICA SO

1178
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
VIOLENT?

1179
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
A DISTURBING QUESTION.

1180
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
WE'LL TRY TO ANSWER IT UPCOMING

1181
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
>> Bill: AS WE TOLD YOU IN THE

1182
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
TALKING POINTS MEMO, STATISTICS

1183
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
PROVE THE USA IS A VIOLENT

1184
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
NATION EVEN THOUGH VIOLENT CRIME

1185
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
RATES ARE DROPPING.

1186
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
OBVIOUSLY WE STILL HAVE FAR TOO

1187
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
MANY PEOPLE DYING IN THE STREETS

1188
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
FROM GUN SHOTS AND OTHER VIOLENT

1189
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
ACTIONS.
HERE IS WHAT CONNECTICUT

1190
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY SAID.

1191
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
>> THIS IS A VIOLENT WORLD.

1192
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WE ARE PARTICULARLY VIOLENT

1193
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
COUNTRY WITHIN THAT WORLD.

1194
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO AN

1195
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
ACT LIKE THIS, THEY'RE GOING TO

1196
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
FIND A WAY TO DO IT IF IT'S NOT

1197
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
IN A BUILDING, IT COULD BE

1198
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
OUTSIDE.
>> Bill: JOINING US FROM

1199
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
WASHINGTON, MARY ELLEN O'TOOL,

1200
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
FORMER SENIOR PROFILE WITH THE

1201
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
F.B.I. AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL

1202
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
DAVE GROSSMAN, RETIRED ARMY.

1203
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "STOP

1204
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
TEACHING OUR KIDS TO KILL, CALL

1205
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
TO ACTION AGAINST TV, GAME MOVIE

1206
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
VIOLENCE."

1207
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
COLONEL, I LOVE THE WAR GAMES

1208
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
WHEN I WAS A KID.

1209
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I HAD GUNS, I RAN AROUND.

1210
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I WATCHED THE WESTERNS.

1211
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
AS I GREW TO AN ADULT, I DIDN'T

1212
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN GUNS OR

1213
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
VIOLENCE OR ANY OF THAT.

1214
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
SO ARE YOU SURE THERE IS A

1215
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT

1216
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
CHILDREN SEE ON TV AND MOVIES

1217
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
AND ALL OF THAT AND HOW THEY

1218
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
BEHAVE?
>> BILL, WHEN I WAS A KID, WE

1219
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
NEVER BUCKLED OUR SEATBELTS.

1220
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
EVERY KID I KNOW NEVER BUCKLED

1221
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
THEIR SEATBELTS AND WE WERE ALL

1222
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
JUST FINE.
BUT BUCKLING THE KIDS IN A SEAT

1223
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
IS A DARN SMART IDEA AND IT

1224
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
SAVED LIVES.  WHAT WE'RE TALKING

1225
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
ABOUT HERE IS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN

1226
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THE EQUATION.

1227
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'M OUR NATION'S NUMBER ONE LAW

1228
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
ENFORCEMENT TRAINER.

1229
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
MORE CONTACT HOURS, MORE CONTACT

1230
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
DAYS THAN ANYBODY IN AMERICA.

1231
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I GOT A BEST SELLING VIDEO

1232
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SERIES FOR CITIZENS, MENTAL

1233
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
PREPARED FOR THE BATTLE.

1234
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
AND WE ARE DOING WHAT THESE

1235
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
VIDEO GAMES, THESE SIMULATORS,

1236
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THESE MURDER SIMULATORS, WE ARE

1237
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
PROVIDING THE SAME CONDITIONING

1238
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
AND THE SAME TRAINING TO

1239
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
CHILDREN THAT WE PROVIDE TO

1240
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
ADULTS IN HIGH QUALITY VIDEOS

1241
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
AND SIMULATIONS THAT WE PROVIDE

1242
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
TO MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

1243
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
IN SIMULATORS.

1244
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THESE ARE MURDER SIMULATORS.

1245
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THEY REHEARSE THE ACTION.

1246
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JUVENILE

1247
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
MASS MURDERER IN THE SCHOOL IN

1248
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
HUMAN HISTORY UNTIL A DOUBLE

1249
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
HOMICIDE IN THE LATE '70S.

1250
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
TODAY JUVENILE MASS MURDERS ARE

1251
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
EVERYWHERE.

1252
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
>> Bill: SO YOU THINK IT'S THE

1253
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
VIDEO GAME, INTERNET CULTURE

1254
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
THAT'S SO INTENSE, SO PERSONAL

1255
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNLIKE WATCHING TV

1256
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
OR A MOVIE, SITTING IN A BIG

1257
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THEATER WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

1258
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THIS IS VERY PERSONAL, IT'S YOU

1259
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
AND THE SCREEN AND YOU ARE

1260
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
ACTUALLY DOING THE SHOOTING.

1261
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
BUT I'LL SUBMIT TO YOU, COLONEL,

1262
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THAT 99 OUT OF 100 CHILDREN WHO

1263
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
PLAY THOSE GAMES AREN'T VIOLENT

1264
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
CHILDREN.

1265
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
IT'S THE ONE THAT HAS SOMETHING

1266
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
GOING ON THAT ACTS OUT.

1267
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
>> YOU KNOW, 99 OF 100 KIDS CAN

1268
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
GO A LIFETIME WITH NO SEATBELT

1269
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ON.
BUT IT'S THE ONE IN 100 THAT

1270
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
DOESN'T HAVE --

1271
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
>> Bill: DO YOU WANT TO BAN ALL

1272
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
OF THOSE GAMES?

1273
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BILL, IS

1274
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

1275
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
VERY SICKEST GAMES AND THE VERY

1276
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
SICKEST MOVIES ARE VERY, VERY

1277
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
SICK INDEED AND THE KIDS WHO

1278
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
GAVE US JONESBORO IN THE MIDDLE

1279
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
SCHOOL, COLUMBINE IN THE HIGH,

1280
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
VIRGINIA TECH IN THE COLLEGES

1281
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
ARE NOW ADULTS GIVING US AURORA,

1282
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
COLORADO AND SANDY HOOK SCHOOLS.

1283
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
>> Bill: DO YOU SEE A DIRECT

1284
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
CORRELATION.
MISS O'TOOL, DO YOU THINK THAT

1285
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE VIOLENT

1286
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
BECAUSE OF THIS INTERNET AND

1287
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
MASS MEDIA CONCENTRATION ON IT?

1288
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
>> MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE

1289
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
ARE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

1290
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
WHO HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR

1291
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
VIOLENCE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

1292
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT, BUT

1293
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE.

1294
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> Bill: MORE SO THAN OTHER

1295
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
COUNTRIES?
MORE SO THAN AUSTRALIA AND

1296
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
CANADA AND GREAT BRITAIN WHERE?

1297
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
WE'RE MORE VIOLENT?

1298
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
>> THE QUALITY OF OUR VIOLENCE

1299
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
IS DIFFERENT AND WHEN I REALLY

1300
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
TOOK NOTE OF THAT, ESPECIALLY

1301
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WHEN IT COMES TO MASS HOMICIDES,

1302
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
WITH ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG

1303
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
ADULTS IS FOLLOWING COLUMBINE.

1304
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THAT REALLY PRESENTED A NEW

1305
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
NORMAL FOR US.

1306
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
AND THAT PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE

1307
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
CAN BE EXACERBATED, CAN BE

1308
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
INCREASED BY VARIABLES LIKE HOW

1309
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
YOU'RE RAISED, WHAT YOU VIEW ON

1310
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
TV OR VIDEO GAMES FOR A SMALL

1311
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

1312
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
SIGNIFICANTLY BUT NEGATIVELY

1313
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
INFLUENCED BY NEGATIVE STIMULI

1314
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000

1315
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
BETWEEN A CHILD WHO HAS A

1317
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE HERE IN

1318
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000

1320
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
