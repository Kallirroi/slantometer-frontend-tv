151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000

FOR $125,000.

ALL THE LEASE--

153

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
$125,000.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
YOU BUILT THE ENTIRE SPACE
FOR $125,000?

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000

OURSELVES.

WHY NOT JUST USE THE PROFITS

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
RECYCLE THEM, AND OPEN UP
ANOTHER COOP HERE IN L.A.?

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
IT'S A BIG CITY.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
I MEAN, THE MANUAL LABOR

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
OF ACTUALLY HAVING
A PHYSICAL SPACE--

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WE'RE OPEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK,
WE'RE ALWAYS THERE.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WE'RE THERE EVERY DAY.
(laughs)

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SO OUR IDEA WAS, LIKE,
WITH FRANCHISES,

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
MAYBE WE COULD OPEN 300.

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
OKAY.
(laughs)

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000

WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT.

(Kevin) LOOK, LADIES,

169

ON THE WAY
TO A SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISE,

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY
AT THE ONES WHO HAVE DONE IT--

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000

THEY CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE TO,

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
SET UP 5 TO 15 LOCATIONS,

173

MANY INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVES

231

AND IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY MORE KIDS,

515
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
SHE'D NAME IT AFTER HER.
(laughs)

516
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
SO MY OLDER BROTHER SAID TO ME
WHEN HE HAD THAT FUDGE,

517
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
HE SAID,
"YOU SHOULD SELL IT."

518
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AND HE SAID,
"WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT?"

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AND I SAID,
"I'LL CALL IT

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
"WHAT YOU
USED TO CALL ME GROWING UP--

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
FAT ASS."

522
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
AND THAT--THAT IDEA

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
NEVER LEFT MY MIND.

524
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I SAW IT. I GOT, LIKE, CHILLS.

525
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I KNEW THAT
THIS WOULD BE A HIT.

526
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT YOU
LAST NIGHT.

527
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'LL HAVE TO TELL YOU.

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
(Robert) WHOA!
(Barbara) WHOA, BABY.

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
(laughs)

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
NO, I DO. (laughs)

531

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
(Robert) BUT DO YOU HAVE SALES
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
YES!
WHAT ARE THEY?

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000

IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
HOW MANY DOLLARS?

543
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
OKAY.

544
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
$60,000.

545
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000

546
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'M NOT AS EXCITED

547
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000

(Barbara) OH, MY GOD.

548

555
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THE NAME ALONE
IS WORTH A MILLION.

556

OH, CAN I JUST TELL YOU
ANOTHER REALLY EXCITING THING?

557
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
NOW IMAGINE ME--
I'M IN A FARMERS' MARKET.

558
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
THIS IS WHERE I STARTED.

559
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ALL THESE PEOPLE COME OUT,

560
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
AND THEY WIPE ME OUT
OF ALL MY PRODUCT,

561
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
LIKE IN A WIND WHIRL.

562
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THE NAME BRINGS THEM TO ME,

563
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
BUT THE TASTE KEEPS PEOPLE
COMING BACK.

564
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
(Barbara) AH.

565
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THIS IS A BRAND.

566
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000

ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES.

567
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000

THE ARRIVAL OF A CHRISTMAS TREE

710
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
MEANS THAT CHRISTMAS
HAD BEGUN IN THE HOUSE.

TWO WEEKS LATER

I STRUGGLED TO GET IN THE HOUSE

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
IN A CONTAINER LIKE THIS
BEFORE CHRISTMAS

718
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
AND PICK IT UP AFTERWARDS?

719
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
IN 2008,
I TOOK MY NAPKIN SKETCH

720
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
AND TURNED IT INTO A WEB SITE.

721
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000

YOU SEE, JUST BECAUSE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

726
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
IT DOESN'T MAKE

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000

730
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
WE CAN TAKE THIS NATIONAL

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THANK YOU.

733
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
SCOTTY CLAUS, HOW MUCH
DO YOU RENT THE TREES FOR?

734
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THE AVERAGE TREE
IS ABOUT $100.

735
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
IT GOES UP TO $200.

736
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
SO IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE
TO RENT A $200 TREE FROM YOU

737
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAN IT WOULD BE
TO BUY IT LOCALLY?
RIGHT.

738
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
OH.
WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT TRYING
TO GO AFTER THAT MARKET.

739
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
(Daymond)
WHY WOULD I PAY FOR THAT

740
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
IF I COULD BUY IT
AT THE SAME PRICE?

741
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
WE DELIVER IT TO YOUR HOUSE
AND WE PICK IT UP AFTERWARDS.

742
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
YOU DON'T WANT A TREE.

743

YOU CAN GO ON-LINE.

751
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000

756
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
HOW MANY MARKETS
ARE YOU IN?

757
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

758
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
(Robert) I LIKE THE IDEA.

759
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
LIKE BARBARA SAID,
FIRST FIVE YEARS, GOING IN THE--

760
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
IN THE FOREST, CUTTING DOWN
MY OWN TREE WAS WONDERFUL.

761
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
AFTER THAT, I WANT SOMEBODY
TO DELIVER IT.

762
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
GOING INTO THE FOREST
AND CUTTING IT DOWN?

763
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I DIDN'T SAY GO IN THE FOREST
AND CUTTING IT DOWN.

764
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
(Mark and Barbara laugh)

765
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
IS THAT CROATIAN?
NO! THAT'S THE KIND OF...

766
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
(Scott) LET ME TELL YOU,
THERE'S PEOPLE--
HARDY GUY I AM.

767
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I GO INTO THE FOREST,
I CUT MY OWN TREE, MARK.

768
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
SO THE CACHE IS,
IT'S THE SAME TREE EVERY YEAR,

769
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
IT BECOMES PART OF OUR FAMILY?

770
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
YEAH.

771
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
THE WHOLE SYMBOL
ABOUT HAVING A TREE

772
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE
IN YOUR HOME,

773
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
AND THE DIFFERENCE OF HAVING

774
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
SOMETHING SLOWLY DYING
IN THE CORNER

775
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
OR PLASTIC IN THE CORNER
AS OPPOSED TO LIVE TREE

776
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
EXPERIENCE.

777
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WHAT ARE THE SALES?

778
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
$150,000.

779
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
$150,000 IN YOUR SEASON,
WHICH IS BASICALLY ONE MONTH.

780
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
YEAH, IT'S A 2-MONTH SEASON.

781
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT
ON THAT?

782
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
$33,000.

783
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
AND THAT'S AFTER
PAYING YOURSELF?

784
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
NO, I HAVE NOT PAID MYSELF.

785
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
DO I HAVE TO PAY
IF I KILL THE TREE?

786
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
ON THE WEB SITE, IT SAYS
THAT THERE IS A PENALTY.

787
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
YOU GO ON THE NAUGHTY LIST
AND--AND YOU GET FINED.

788
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
IF SOMEONE'S GONE

789
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO RENT
A LIVING CHRISTMAS TREE,

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THEY TEND TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

791
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

792
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
SO I NEED CAPITAL
AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

793
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I NEED A NURSERY WITH
AN AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM.

794
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLANT
MY OWN TREES FROM SEEDLINGS

795
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
AND GROW THEM
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

796
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THEN I CONTROL MY INVENTORY.

797
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
LET ME TELL YOU ALL THE WAYS
I HATE THIS BUSINESS.

798
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
NUMBER ONE, I HATE IT

799
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY
FOR SIX WEEKS OF THE YEAR.

800
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SURE.
NUMBER TWO, I HATE IT

801
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
BECAUSE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN JUST BUYING IT.

802
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
SO MY MARKET IS ONLY PEOPLE

803
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THAT CUMBAYA AND DON'T WANT
TO KILL AT TREE.
SURE.

804
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
AND THEN NUMBER THREE,
I HATE IT

805
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
BECAUSE THE COMPETITION
IS A PLASTIC TREE

806
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THAT I CAN GET
THAT LOOKS IDENTICAL.

807
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
IF I HID A PLASTIC TREE
IN HERE RIGHT NOW,

808
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
YOU COULDN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

809
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I REALLY HATE IT. I'M OUT.

810
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THIS IS VERY, VERY ATTRACTIVE
AND ENDEARING TO ME.

811
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
IT'S A GREEN PLAY.
I LOVE THAT.

812
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I HAVE A-A TREE FARM.

813
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'VE BEEN DYING TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH A GUY

814
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
WITH A HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE.

815
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
(sharks laugh)

816
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
ALL RIGHT?
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

817
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
HIGHER ON MY PRIORITY LIST
THAN BEING IN BUSINESS

818
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WITH A GUY
WITH A HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE.

819
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
WHAT'S THAT?

820
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
BEING IN BUSINESS WITH A WOMAN
WITH A HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE.

821
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
(all laugh)

822
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT
FOR YOU.

823
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I KNOW THE CHALLENGES
YOU'RE GONNA FACE.

824
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
YOU HAVE THE PRICE OF GAS
GOING UP,

825
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
AND SHIP THESE TREES,

826
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THEN YOU'RE GONNA PICK 'EM UP
AND BRING 'EM BACK, RIGHT?

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THE TREES GROW,
YOU NEED TO ACQUIRE MORE LAND.

828
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THAT MEANS, MORE FERTILIZER,
THAT MEANS MORE WATER,

829
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
THAT MEANS MORE HAVING TO DEAL
WITH DEER AND OTHER THINGS

830
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THAT ARE KILLING THE TREES.

831
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
AND THE--THE ANSWERS
YOU'RE GIVING ME,

832
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT

833
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
ARE A LITTLE HARDER
THAN YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE.

834
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
SO I'M OUT.

835
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
VERY SWEET OF YOU.

836
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
(Robert) SCOTTY CLAUS,
I DON'T WANT TO BE A GRINCH.

837
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'M NOT SEEING THE GROWTH CURVE.
OKAY.

838
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I-I THINK
IT'S A GOOD BUSINESS FOR YOU,

839
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
NOT AN INVESTMENT FOR ME.

840
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'M OUT.

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

842
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
SO AND--AND--AND--
AND--AND SO WHAT I'M OFFERING,

843
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
IT'S A $2-BILLION MARKET.

844
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ONE THING WE KNOW--

845
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
THAT CHRISTMAS IS NOT GONNA BE
CANCELED NEXT YEAR.

846
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

847
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I FEEL LIKE I'VE--I'VE SOLVED

848
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THE DEFORESTATION PROBLEM,
THE CONVENIENCE PROBLEM,

849
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
BY WHAT WE'RE DOING.

850
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
(Barbara)
BUT HERE'S THE RUB, RIGHT?

851
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
YOU'VE BEEN
IN BUSINESS FOUR YEARS,

852

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT?

1022
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WE DO HAVE
A PROVISIONAL PATENT.

1023
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
YOU'RE TELLING ME,
FOR $100,000 I GET 20%.

1024
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
(Connor) CORRECT.
AND BECAUSE
YOU'RE SMART M.B.A.s

1025
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AND ACCOUNTING PEOPLE,

1026
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING YOUR
BUSINESS IS WORTH RIGHT NOW?

1027
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
SO WE'RE GONNA
STEER YOU CLEAR--

1028
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
WHAT IS IT?
GIVE ME THE NUMBER.

1029
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
LET ME--LET ME--
LET ME PREFACE THAT--

1030
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
PROFESSOR O'LEARY
WANTS TO KNOW THE ANSWER.

1031
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
LET ME--LET ME TRY AND STEER YOU
CLEAR OF A VALUATION--

1032
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
ARE YOU GROVELING AND BEGGING
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER

1033
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
IS CRAZY?
WE WANT--HE WANTS TO KNOW--

1034
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
OKAY. CONNOR, CAN I TAKE IT?
WHAT'S CRAZY IS TO TRY

1035
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
TO VALUE A COMPANY
THAT IS PRE-REVENUE.

1036
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
(Connor) IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE
COULD DO DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW--
WELL DONE.

1037
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
POINT WELL DONE.
LET ME VALUE IT.

1038
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT--IS--

1039
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
(Jillian) BUT I CAN TALK
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

1040
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
RIGHT NOW.
ONE SECOND. ONE SECOND.

1041
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
(Kevin) 'CAUSE YOU KNOW--
JILLIAN, YOU KNOW...
BRING IT ON. LET'S DO IT.

1042
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
YOU'RE GONNA SELL EXACTLY
HOW MANY IN 12 MONTHS?

1043
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YES. WELL,
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

1044
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
(laughs)

1045
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
HOW MUCH ARE YOU SAYING
YOUR COMPANY IS WORTH?

1046
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
OKAY, 200--IF WE SELL 200,000
UNITS IN THE FIRST YEAR--

1047
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
NO, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO. YOU ASKED FOR--

1048
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHEN YOU
IMPUTE A VALUE ON THE COMPANY--

1049
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I GIVE YOU $100,000,
YOU GIVE ME 20% OF THE STOCK--

1050
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOUR COMPANY'S WORTH TODAY?

1051
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I BASED 2 VALUATION METHODS
OFF OF 200,000 UNITS OF SALES

1052
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
OR 100,000 UNITS OF SALES
IN THE FIRST YEAR.

1053
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
THAT BROUGHT US TO
A $4.3-MILLION VALUATION

1054
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
AND THEN
A $1.9-MILLION VALUATION.

1055
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
YOU STILL HAVEN'T GIVEN US
THE ANSWER.

1056
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THERE IS A NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE
VALUATED YOUR COMPANY AT--

1057
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
$500,000 IS WHAT--

1058
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S ALL.

1059
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
BUT--BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M VALUING IT AT

1060
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
BECAUSE I REALIZED
THAT'S IT NOT JUST THE CASH.

1061
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE
A VALUE 500--
THE CASH IS JUST AN ASSET--

1062
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WASTED EVERYBODY'S TIME.

1063
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
'CAUSE THEY HAD--THEY DON'T--
THEY'RE NOT CREATIVE

1064
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE

1065
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
AND THEY HAVE NO ABILITY
TO INCREASE THE VALUE.

1066
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
WHY ISN'T IT--
SO THIS IS THE DEAL--

1067
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WELL, I BET YOU SHE'LL BE
REAL ACCURATE ABOUT MY MONEY

1068
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
WHEN IT COMES OVER THERE,
RIGHT?
TELL US--

1069
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
SHE'LL HAVE AN ACCURATE
VALUATION OF THAT, WOULDN'T SHE?

1070
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
TELL US ABOUT HOW MUCH
IT COSTS TO MAKE THESE

1071
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
AND HOW LOW YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET YOUR COST,

1072
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
UM, BASED OFF OF,
UM, VOLUME.

1073
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
(Connor) SO RECENTLY WE
PARTNERED WITH A MANUFACTURER

1074
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
AND, UH, SHE QUOTED US
AT $4, SAID AND DONE.

1075
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
TO SUPPORT THE 200,000 UNITS

1076
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
THAT I SAID WE CAN SELL.

1077
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AND I CAN BREAK--
IF WE CUT IT IN--

1078
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
DOWN INTO 100,000 UNITS
FOR ONE YEAR,

1079
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
THAT'S $1.9-MILLION
VALUATION.

1080
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I CAN--I CAN BREAK OUT--

1081
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'M IN THIS SPACE.

1082
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1083
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THANK YOU.

1084
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
IT'S WORTH NOTHING.

1085
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
WELL, WE HA--
NOT YET. IT CAN'T
BE WORTH ANYTHING,

1086
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
WHICH IS WHY WE DON'T TRY
TO VALUATE IN FRONT OF IT.
BUT YOU'RE ASKING--

1087
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
YOU JUST SAID "NOT YET.
IT CAN'T BE WORTH ANYTHING,"

1088
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
BUT YOU WANT

1089
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
A HALF-A-MILLION-DOLLARS
VALUATION ON OUR COMPANY.

1090
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I HAD A MEETING WITH THE VICE
PRESIDENT OF SALES AND MARKETING

1091
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
AT NORDSTROM
UP IN SEATTLE ABOUT--

1092
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY?

1093
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
LOVED THE CONCEPT.

1094
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
BUT YOU NEED A BUYER? DID THEY
PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH A BUYER?

1095
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
NO. HE SAID, "I DON'T WANT TO
PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH A BUYER

1096
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
UNTIL YOU HAVE
THE FINAL PRODUCT."
(Daymond) RIGHT.

1097
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
BUT YOU HAVE PUT

1098
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
A HALF-A-MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION ON

1099
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
BASICALLY A PIECE OF HOSIERY
WITH A BAG.

1100
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
DAYMOND, ARE YOU--
MAYBE IT'S
THE BEST THING EVER...

1101
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
EVERYTHING COMES BACK

1102
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
TO ONE THING IN LIFE--
MONEY?
YES.

1103
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
OKAY, THEN LET ME TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

1104
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
YOU'RE INSANE.
(Connor laughs)

1105
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THIS IS NOT WORTH $500,000.

1106
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
UNDER NO SCENARIO WOULD I EVER
GIVE YOU $100,000 FOR ONLY 20%.

1107
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
$100,000 IS WHAT
THE WHOLE THING IS WORTH, MAYBE.

1108
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'M STUCK.
I'M CHOKING ON IT, YOU KNOW?

1109
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
LET ME ADDRESS THAT.

1110
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN SAY.
IF WE--

1111
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THERE'S NOT A WORD--
ANOTHER WORD YOU COULD SAY

1112
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THAT WOULD EVER, EVER, EVER
CONVINCE ME THIS--

1113
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WHAT ABOUT "MONEY"?

1114
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
WE HAVE 50 GRAND CASH
IN OUR ACCOUNT.
(laughs)

1115
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
WHERE DID YOU GET
THE 50 GRAND?

1116
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
WE HAD
TWO PEOPLE APPROACH US.

1117
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
THEIR BUY-IN, THEIR CAPITAL
CONTRIBUTION WAS 50 GRAND.

1118
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
AT THAT TIME, WE DIDN'T
EVEN HAVE A PRODUCT.

1119
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
IT WAS AN IDEA.
YOU STILL DON'T.

1120
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
WE DO. THAT--
THAT WILL SELL.

1121
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
THIS ONE ON MY LEG
WILL SELL ON A WEB SITE.

1122
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
SO WHAT DID YOU--
WILL SELL.

1123
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
HOW MUCH OF THE COMPANY
DID YOU SELL THEM FOR $50,000?

1124
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
40%.

1125
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
JILLIAN AND I
ARE 60% STAKEHOLDERS.

1126
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THEY GOT 40% FOR $50,000?

1127
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
WE HAD NOTHING
AT THAT POINT.

1128
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

1129
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
WE DIDN'T HAVE A DISTRIBUTOR.
WE DIDN'T HAVE A DESIGNER.

1130
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
(laughs)
WE DIDN'T HAVE P.O.s
HANGING IN FRONT OF US.

1131
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
DO YOU SEE MY DILEMMA?
YOU STILL
DON'T HAVE A P.O.

1132
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WAIT, WAIT. BUT, KEVIN...
WE HAVE P.O.s
HANGING IN FRONT OF US.

1133
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THEY'RE--
THEY ARE ALSO WORKING.

1134
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THEY'RE MANAGING PARTNERS--
YOU COME IN HERE
WITH THIS STORY...

1135
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
THEY WORK 60 HOURS A WEEK.

1136
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
AND YOU CHARGE ME
TEN TIMES MORE?

1137
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
ARE YOU CRAZY?

1138
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
NO, I'M NOT CRAZY...
WELL, IT'S NOT TEN TIMES.

1139
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THE COMPANY'S WORTH.

1140
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
GUYS, YOU GUYS
JUST DON'T GET IT.

1141
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
YOU DON'T HAVE A--YOU HAVE P.O.s
THAT YOU CAN SHOW US?

1142
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
NO, WE DON'T HAVE P.O.s

1143
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
NO, I'M SAYING.
I HAVE A--ONE WAITING.

1144
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I MEAN, 24,000 UNITS--

1145
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
YOU HAVE ONE WAITING.
OH, I GOT IT.

1146
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
A PRODUCT TO GIVE TO HER.

1147
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
(sharks laughing)
(Connor) LOOK, KEVIN,

1148
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
IF YOU WERE WILLING TO WORK
AND SLAVE ON THIS PRODUCT--

1149
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
(Kevin) CONNOR...
YOU CAN HAVE THE EXACT
SAME RATE THEY GOT.

1150
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
CRITICAL MISTAKE
IF YOU THINK I WOULD EVER PAY

1151
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
10 TIMES MORE THAN SOME COLLEGE
GUY GOT IT FOR 30 DAYS AGO.

1152
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

1153
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
OKAY, IT'S FIVE TIMES.
FIVE TIMES MORE.

1154
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
ONLY FIVE TIMES?
OH, THAT'S MUCH MORE EXCITING.

1155
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WELL, NO, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
THEY BROUGHT TO THE COMPANY

1156
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
BECAUSE THAT'S WORTH A LOT.
SURE. CASH, RIGHT?

1157
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THEY BROUGHT CASH...
CASH--

1158
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
BUT THEY ALSO--
THEY BROUGHT A DESIGNER,

1159
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
A SUPPLIER IN ARE AREA THAT
CAN PRODUCE ANY QUANTITY,

1160
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
LITERALLY ANY QUANTITY,

1161
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
UP TO A MILLION UNITS
WITHIN A YEAR.

1162
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
BY THE WAY--
THAT'S INVALUABLE,

1163
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
TO FIND A SUPPLY CHAIN
THAT IS WELL-OILED.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK--

1164
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THAT IS NOT INVALUABLE.
THAT'S EVERYBODY.
I-I--

1165
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
TO FIND A SUPPLY CHAIN
THAT IS WELL-OILED?

1166
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THAT'S EVERYBODY.
THAT'S OUT THERE.
I AM VERY, VERY WORRIED--

1167
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
THAT'S EVERYBODY.

1168
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
THAT'S SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE
BEFORE WE HAD THEM.

1169
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
FACTORIES EXIST FOR?
(Barbara) TALK.

1170
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
(Kevin) LISTEN, I'M VERY WORRIED
FOR BOTH OF YOU

1171
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU COME IN HERE

1172
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
WITH A CRAZY VALUATION--

1173
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
SOMETIMES A LIGHTNING BOLT

1174
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
COMES FROM THE CEILING
AND FRIES YOU.

1175
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
AND I THINK THAT'S HAPPENING

TO ME

WHAT I'M GONNA DO--

TO GET TO 200,000 UNITS"

CRYSTAL-CLEAR SENSE TO ME,

THE HUN--THEN THE $100,000
IS NOTHING.
