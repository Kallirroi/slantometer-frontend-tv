1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> I'M TELLING YOU, NEVER WORK

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
WITH ANIMALS OR FISH.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
IT IS ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
YOU HAVE TO PRY A LARGE-MOUTHED

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
BASS OFF GARY TUCHMAN'S NECK.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
THIS ANCHOR WAS A PRO.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
NO HARM DONE.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
CNBC STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
IF IT REALLY WANTS TO MAKE
HISTORY IN THE FINANCIAL NEWS

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
BLOOPER DEPARTMENT.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> AT NO POINT WERE YOU RUNNING

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A GYM?

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> NO, NO.
RUNNING A GYM?

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TO WORK OUT OR SOMETHING?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
JESUS [ BLEEP ] CHRIST.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I COME ON THE NEWS FOR TWO

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
SECONDS AND YOU WANT TO -- EVERY

CAN'T YOU [ BLEEP ] A ROUTINE
HERE.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
>>> TODAY'S A SOLDIER WAS KILLED

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
IN KANDAHAR AFTER I VISITED THE
BASE.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
IT IS A SAD REMINDER OF HOW

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
UNSAFE THIS COUNTRY REMAINS

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AFTER 11 YEARS OF WAR.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I WILL ASK THE SECRETARY WHAT
HAPPENED NEXT AS AMERICAN TROOPS

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
PREPARE IT LEAVE AFGHANISTAN AND

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A SOBERING REMINDER OF HOW

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
AMERICA'S WAR IS STILL NOT WON.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A SECURE

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
AFGHANISTAN.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
TODAY, JUST HOURS AFTER I

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WRAPPED UP AN INTERVIEW WITH THE

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LEON

TALIBAN TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
AN AMERICAN SOLDIER HAS WITHIN

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
KILLED.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TWO AFGHAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
AMERICANS AND AFGHANS WERE

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WOUNDED IN THIS ATTACK TODAY.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A TALIBAN SPOKESMAN NOT ONLY

INVITED HIM IT MEET WITH

PRESIDENT OBAMA NEXT MONTH.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEADERS

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
IS WHERE DO THINGS NOW STAND AND

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
WHAT'S NEXT?

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
11 YEARS, TWO MONTHS AND SIX

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
DAYS.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> WE WILL NOT TIRE, WE WILL NOT

FAULTER, AND WE WILL NOT FAIL.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> PEACE AND FREEDOM WILL

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
PREVAIL.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> JUST ONE MONTH AFTER 9/11 WBT

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WAR AGAINST THE TALIBAN AND AL

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
QAEDA AND AFGHANISTAN, IT HAS

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000

AMERICANS DEAD AND MORE THAN

18,000 WOUNDED.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
642 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS SPENT.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
AND AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF AFGHAN

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
CIVILIANS KILLED.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AT LEAST 12,000 IN THE LAST FIVE

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
YEARS.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WITH THAT SACRIFICE, CAME SOME

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
PROGRESS.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE TALIBAN WAS REMOVED FROM

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
POWER AND --

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
>> I CAN REPORT TO THE AMERICAN

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD, THAT

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
UNITED STATES HAS CONDUCTED AN

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
OPERATION THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
LADEN, THE LATER OF AL QAEDA.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> AS COMBAT TROOPS PREPARE IT

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
COME HOME IN 2014, THE TALIBAN

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IS RESURGING.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
JUST THIS WEEK, A MEMBER OF THE

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
NAVY'S ELITE S.E.A.L. TEAM 6,

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE SAME GROUP WHO DIED TRYING

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
TO SAVE A DOCTOR ABDUCTED BY THE

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TALIBAN.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
AFGHAN TROOPS AREN'T READY TO

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
FIGHT THEM.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DEVERSION RATES ARE HIGH AND THE

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
UNITE HE NATION REPORTS

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
POLICEMEN ARE JOINING THE
TALIBAN.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
EXTREMIST IN THE AFGHAN SECURITY

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
FORCES HAVE KILLED 33 AMERICANS
THIS YEAR.

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
AND AFGHAN CIVILIANS FEAR THE
FUTURE.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
>> Translator: I DON'T A HUNDRED

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PERCENT BELIEVE THERE ARE

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NATIONAL ARMIES CAPABLE.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
EVERYDAY WE HEAR OUR SOLDIERS

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
ARE KILLED IN THE INSECURE

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
PROVINCES.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> 11 YEARS, 6 MONTHS AND 2
DAYS.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WHEN WILL THIS MISSION BE

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ACCOMPLISHED?

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE ISSUE OF READINESS ON THE

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
PART OF AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
TO TAKE OVER THE FIGHT AGAINST

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AL QAEDA AND TERRORIST IN THIS

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
COUNTRY IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE TO

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
DETERMINE IF AMERICA STAYS AND

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
HOW MANY AMERICAN TROOPS WILL

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THIS

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
COUNTRY.

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THERE WAS A NEW PENTAGON REPORT

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OUT THIS WEEK, IMPORTANT IT CAME

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
FROM THE PENTAGON.
THEY ARE TRYING TO TELL A STORY

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
OF IMPROVEMENT HERE, BUT

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
PENTAGON REPORT ITSELF SAID THAT

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ONLY ONE UNDER 23 AFGHAN BRIGADE
SAYS ACTUALLY READY TO TAKE OVER

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SECURITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
AN ARMY WHERE 85% OF RECRUITS

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
ARE ILL LITERAL.

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE CHALLENGES CAN BE
OVERWHELMING.

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I SPOKE SPECIFICALLY NO LEON

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PANETTA TODAY IN KANDAHAR AND

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS DAUNTING
CHALLENGE.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
>> OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A, YOU

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
KNOW, A LITERACY PROBLEM WITH

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
REGARDS TO FORCES AND YOU KNOW,

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WE CONTINUE IT TRY TO PREPARE

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THEM FOR THE ABILITY TO TAKE

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OVER ALL OF THIS SECURITY

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
RESPONSIBILITIES.

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THE GOOD NEWS

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
TRAINING EFFORT, THEY ARE

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
DEALING WITH ILLITERACY AND

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
PROVIDING QUICK CLASSES FOR

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT GO INTO

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THE ARMY, SO THEY ARE MEETING

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THEY ARE DEVELOPING THE KIND OF

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TRAINING AND CAPABILITY THAT

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THEY NEED.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
BUT THIS IS AN AREA WE'RE JUST

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS ON

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
INTENSELY.
BECAUSE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS,

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
AND PARTICULARLY IN 2013, WE

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HAVE TO REACH A STAGE WHERE A

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE
OPERATIONS ARE IN THE HANDS OF

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE AFGHAN ARMY.

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT MORE

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WORK.
>> SO IS THAT WHY THERE'S BEEN A

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
BIT OF A DELAY?

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I WAS LOOKING AT HEADLINES A FEW

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WEEKS AGO AND SAID WE WOULD HAVE
A TROOP COUNT DECISION IN A FEW

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WEEKS.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THE HEADLINES A COUPLE DAYS AGO

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WERE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A TROUPE

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
DECISION IN A FEW WEEKS.

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHAT IS CAUSING THAT DELAY?

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ARE YOU NOT SURE OF THAT NUMBER?
WHERE IS THE DELAY?

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> NO, I THINK, YOU KNOW, I

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST, THAT

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
GENERAL ALAN HAVING DEVELOPED A

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN IS

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE ONE THAT HAS TO COME FORWARD
WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WHAT ENDURING PRESENCE WILL LOOK

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
LIKE AN HE IS PREPARED SEVERAL
OPTIONS.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WE HAVE REVIEWED THEM.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
BE PRESENTED TO THE NATIONAL

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH REVIEWS

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THEM AND THEN PRESENT IT TO THE

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
PRESIDENT FOR FINAL DECISION.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT TAKES TIME AND WE WANT TO

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
MAKE SURE, OBVIOUSLY, THAT WE

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION WITH THE

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
SLICE OF THAT ENDURING PRESENCE.

193
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORRY

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THAT U.S. WILL HAVE TOO FEW
PEOPLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT'S REQUIRED.

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SOMEONE SAID THAT NUMBER IS

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
20,000.

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ANYTHING FEWER THAN THAT IS NOT
ENOUGH.

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
IS THAT FAIR?

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON THE
MISSIONS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ABLE TO WORK ON IN THAT ENDURING

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
PRESENCE.

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
AND THE KEY MISSIONS ARE THE

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
FOLLOWING.

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ONE IS COUNTERTERRORISM WHICH

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
MEANS IT CONTINUE TO CONFRONT AL
QAEDA.

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
AND THOSE THAT YOU KNOW, HAVE

208
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ALWAYS CONTINUED TO PLAN ATTACKS

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
ON THE UNITED STATES.

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THERE IS NO AL QAEDA THREAT HERE

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
IN AFGHANISTAN.

213
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SECONDLY, TO DOT TRAINING AND

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
ASSISTANCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THE AFGHAN ARMY AND THIRDLY, TO
PROVIDE SOME OF THE ENABLING

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
CAPABILITY FOR THE FORCES THAT

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
ARE HERE.

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NATURE

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OF THE PRESENCE.

220
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, IF

221
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
MISSION, THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
HAS TO REST WITH THE AFGHAN

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
ARMY.

225
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> SO YOU'RE NOT YET SURE ON THE

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
NUMBER?

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU'RE JUST
WAITING FOR AN OUTSET, YOU'RE

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
NOT SURE ON THE NUMBER.
>> WE ARE WORKING INTENTLY RIGHT

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
NOW TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THAT WILL BE.

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU
SAY A LOT HAS TO DO WITH THE

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
MISSION.

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I WILL QUOTE THE PRESIDENT WITH

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
BE TO DEFEAT, DISRUPT AND

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DESTROY AL QAEDA.

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> RIGHT.

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> IS THAT MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> THE MISSION OF DEFEATING AND

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
DETERRING AL QAEDA, I THINK, IS

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WELL ON THE WAY TOWARDS, YOU

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
KNOW, ACHIEVING THE MISSION WITH

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
REGARDS TO AFGHANISTAN.

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND THE THREAT THAT WE FACE

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
HERE.

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WE CONTINUE TO FACE AL QAEDA

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
OBVIOUSLY ELSEWHERE.

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
NOT ONLY IN PAKISTAN, BUT YEMEN

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
AND SOMALIA AND ELSEWHERE.

249
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
BUT WE HAVE HAD REMARKABLE

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SUCCESS GOING AFTER SPECIAL

251
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OPERATIONS AGAINST AL QAEDA HERE

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT.
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MAIN

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
CHALLENGE HERE IS OBVIOUSLY TO

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SAFE HAVEN

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
FOR AL QAEDA IN WHICH TO CONDUCT

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
ATTACKS BUT THE KEY IT THAT IS
AN AFGHANISTAN THAT CAN SECURE

257
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
AND GOVERN ITSELF.

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THOSE TWO ARE INNER LOCKED IN

259
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TERMS OF MISSION THATTED WITH IN

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
AFGHANISTAN.

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> WHAT IF THEY CHOOSE A

262
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
TALIBAN.

263
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
YOU KNOW, I'M VERY CONFIDENT

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THAT THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WANT TO

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BE SOVEREIGN.
THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT.

266
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THEY WANT TO BE FREE FROM THE

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
TALIBAN.

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
BUT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO

269
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE.

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AND THAT'S OKAY.

271
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
HERE.
JUST TO HAVE AN AFGHANISTAN THAT

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
CAN DETERMINE.

274
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEFEATING

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AL QAEDA, JUST THINKING ABOUT

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SOME OF THE STATISTIC HERE,
THERE IS STILL INSURGENCY, 93

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
POLICEMEN IN ONE DAY JOINED THE

278
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
TALIBAN.
DO YOU THINK AL QAEDA WILL BE

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
DEFEATED, EVEN HERE?
>> I THINK YOU CAN REACH A POINT

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WHERE YOU SO SIGNIFICANTLY

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WEAKEN AL QAEDA THAT, YOU KNOW,

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
ALTHOUGH THERE MAY STILL BE A

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
FEW PEOPLE AROUND, THEY WON'T BE

284
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
ABLE TO CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THAT THEY'VE CONDUCTED IN THE

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
PAST AND THEY CERTAINLY WON'T BE

287
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
ABLE TO PLAN THE KIND OF ATTACKS
THAT AMERICA HAD HAPPEN TO IT ON

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
9/11.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AND THAT'S OUR GOAL, IS TO MAKE
SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AL QAEDA

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
AND WHERE IT IS, NOW WIDELY SEEN

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AS A SAFE HAVEN FOR AL QAEDA AND
LINKED TO, INSPIRED BY, WHATEVER

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THE WORDS MIGHT BE, DOES THE

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
UNITED STATES HAVE TO INTERVENE

295
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
IN MALLY?

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> WE'VE GOT TO GO AFTER AL
QAEDA WHEREVER THE HELL THEY'RE

297
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AT AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE NO

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
PLACE IT HIDE.
LET'S NOT FORGET, THE MAIN GOAL

299
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
OF AL QAEDA IS TO ATTACK THE

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
UNITED STATES.

301
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
AND WE AREN'T GOING TO ALLOW

302
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

303
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
IF WE AREN'T GOING TO ALLOW IT

304
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TO HAPPEN, WE'VE GOT TO GO AFTER
THEM IN SOMALIA AND YES IN

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
YEMEN.

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> AS YOU ASSESS THREATS TO THE

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
HOMELAND, HOW BIG OF A THREAT IS
AL QAEDA?

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
>> I THINK WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WEAKENED THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
KIND OF COMMAND AND CONTROL.

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND PLANNING THAT WOULD BE

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
NECESSARY TO CONDUCT ANOTHER

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
9/11 ATTACK.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY STILL

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CONTINUE TO THREATEN OUR
COUNTRY.

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
AND THEY STILL REPRESENT, I

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THINK, PROBABLY THE MOST

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
IMPORTANT THREAT WE STILL FACE
IN THE WORLD.

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SECRETARY.

AN AMERICAN SOLDIER LOST HIS

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
LIFE IN A SUICIDE ATTACK BY THE
TALIBAN.

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
IT HAPPENED IN A BASE IN

325

IS SUSTAINABILITY.
CAN WE SUSTAIN IT.

THAT THE REALITY WHEN THE U.S.
LEAVES, HOW BIG IS THE RISK THAT

429

TURNING POINT WILL BE THE AFGHAN

ALL THOSE THINGS ARE A BIG

IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT ELECTION

447
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, BUT THEN
SECURITY WILL BE DETERIORATING

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
BECAUSE PUBLIC SUPPORT WILL NOT

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
BE THERE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
BEFORE THEY GO HOME.
IT'S A HARD AND STRESSFUL

702
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
SITUATION.
THERE IS SO MUCH SACRIFICE.

703
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
BUT AS WE LEARNED FROM THE BURNT

704
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
FAMILY, IT IS SOMETHING THAT

705
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
FAMILIES AT HOME LEARN TO DEAL
WITH.

THIS IS AN M-WRAP.

735
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
IT'S A VEHICLE THAT WE USE, IT
CARRIES ROUGHLY FIVE PERSONNEL.

736
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
YOU HAVE THE DRIVER, THE TANK

737
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
COMMANDER, WHICH IS A PASSENGER,
AND THE TWO DISMOUNTS IN THE

738

BASICALLY, OF THE VEHICLE.

THE GUNNER DOES, IF I NEED TO

746
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
REACT TO CERTAIN THINGS, AND I'M

747
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
BASICALLY THE PASSENGER, THE TC

748
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
OR SHOTGUN SEAT, IF YOU WANT TO

749
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
SAY.
>> SO DO YOU EVER -- I GUESS

750
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I -- DO YOU EVER GET SCARED?
>> I GUESS IT'S ONLY HUMAN

751
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
NATURE TO GET SCARED, IN SOME
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

752
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
BUT YOU DO IT SO MANY TIMES, YOU

753
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
GET USED TO IT IN, IN A WAY.
AND I'VE BEEN TRAINING WITH

754
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THESE PEOPLE SO LONG, WE ALMOST

755
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
BEFORE WE DO IT.

756
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
AND IT IS SECOND NATURE FOR US

757
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
AND IT'S PRETTY EASY AT TIMES.
>> AND YOU SAY IT'S SECOND

758
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
NATURE, AND YOU KNOW THESE

759
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
PEOPLE BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE
WORLD.

760
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
IS THIS SORT OF LIKE A SECOND
FAMILY TO YOU, IN ANY WAY?

761
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY MY SECOND

762
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
FAMILY.
EVEN AS I CAME INTO THE

763
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
MILITARY, MY WIFE, IN GENERAL,
WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A BIG PART

764
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OF OUR FAMILY.

765
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
AND MY WIFE HAS ACCEPTED
EVERYONE THAT I'VE TRAINED OR

766
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
BEEN LEADERS OF AND IT IS

767
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
DEFINITELY A SECOND FAMILY FOR
ME, DEFINITELY.

768
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
>> AND THIS HAS BEEN YOUR CAREER

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
FROM THE BEGINNING?
>> THIS HAS BEEN MY CAREER FROM

770
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
THE BEGINNING.
I'VE BEEN IN 12 YEARS.

771
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY, WHATEVER

772
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I DO, I EXCEL AT, AND I TRY TO
MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT, AND

773
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT I'VE

774
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
DONE MY WHOLE CAREER.
>> YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AT

775
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
HOME, THEY WONDER, DID AMERICA

776
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
REALLY GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS
WAR?

777
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WHAT HAVE WE ACCOMPLISHED?
AND YOU'RE HERE EVER DAY, YOU'RE

778
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
FIGHTING, YOU'RE PATROLLING HERE

779
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
IN KANDAHAR.
WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN OUT OF THIS?

780
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> WE'VE GOTTEN QUITE A BIT.

781
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I MEAN, HONESTLY, THE AFGHAN
PEOPLE, EVEN FROM WHAT I WAS

782
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
DEPLOYED IN IRAQ IN '03, DURING

783
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THE INVASION, YOU COULD SEE THE
IRAQ PEOPLE AND THE AFGHAN

784
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
PEOPLE STARTING TO DO STUFF ON

785
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THEIR OWN.
HAVING MORE FREEDOM AND STUFF

786
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
LIKE THAT.
AND THAT IS A BIG THING THAT I

787
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
TAKE OUT OF THIS.

788
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
IS THEM BEING ABLE TO DO STUFF
ON THEIR OWN, WITHOUT HAVING

789
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, TELLING THEM

790
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

791
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

792
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
AND I THINK THAT'S FREEDOM AND

793
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
STUFF LIKE THAT IS A BIG

794
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME, BEING

795
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
HERE, THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME,

796
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
AND SEEING THE GAINS THAT WE
HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

797
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> AND DO YOU THINK, FROM WHERE

798
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
YOU SIT, THAT AFGHANISTAN IS
GOING TO BE READY, FOR PEOPLE

799
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
LIKE YOU TO GO HOME?

800
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> YES, I DEFINITELY DO.

801
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'M GOING ON PATROL WITH THE

802
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
PARTNERS.

803
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> YOU GO OUT WITH THEM, BECAUSE

804
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
YOU'RE TRAINING THEM --?

805
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
>> EXACTLY.
AND THEY DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN

806
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THAT YEARS AGO THEY WERE NOT
DOING ON THEIR OWN.

807
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THE LOGISTICS PART OF IT AND ALL

808
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THAT STUFF.
THEY ARE SUSTAINABLE BY

809
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THEMSELVES.
>> WE HEAR A LOT, THOUGH, ABOUT

810
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
AFGHANS WHO WORK WITH AMERICANS

811
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
AND THEN THEY WILL BLOW
THEMSELVES UP AND KILL

812
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
AMERICANS.
DO YOU HAVE A FEAR THAT THAT

813
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
COULD HAPPEN?
>> IT WOULD BE ALMOST UNHUMAN TO

814
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THINK THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR

815
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
MIND, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET WHAT

816
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WE CALL COMPLACENT, BUT WE'VE
BUILT SUCH A TRUST WITH THESE

817
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
GUYS THAT THE IN AND OUT DAYS OF

818
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
WORKING WITH THEM, THAT STUFF
JUST GOES TO THE WAYSIDE,

819
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM

820
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
AS ONE OF YOUR BROTHERS, WORKING
WITH THEM, AND ONE OF YOUR OWN

821
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
SOLDIERS, ALSO.

822
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
>> AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT?
>> TOTALLY FINE, YES.

823
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> SERGEANT, WHAT MAKES YOU THE

824
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
MOST PROUD ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE
DONE HERE?

825
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> I THINK THE MOST PROUD IS
JUST SEEING THE KIDS, AND THAT

826
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
GENERATION THAT ARE GOING TO

827
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE HERE IN

828
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
AFGHANISTAN.
THE ELDERS AND STUFF ARE STILL

829
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
IN THAT MIND-SET, BUT THE
YOUNGER GENERATIONS, WHAT --

830
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK

831
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
FORWARD TO AS THE YEARS PROGRESS
IN THIS COUNTRY, IN AFGHANISTAN,

832
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
IS THAT THE SUCCESSES THEY CAN

833
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
MAKE, THEY CAN GO OUT AND BE

834
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
SOMEONE, RATHER THAN BEING
SECLUDED IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS,

835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THEY CAN MAKE LIVES FOR

836
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THEMSELVES, OUTSIDE OF HERE.
>> AND WOULD YOU GO TO ANOTHER

837
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WAR, IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAR?
THE WAR ON TERROR CONTINUES.

838
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE, WOULD YOU

839
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
STILL GO?

840
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, YES.

841
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP TO DO
FOR MY COUNTRY.

842
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY I

843
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
JOINED THE MILITARY, FOR MY

844
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
COUNTRY AND FOR MY FAMILY, TO

845
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SUPPORT MY FAMILY, AND THOSE ARE

846
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
TWO THINGS I LOVE THE MOST, SO I

847
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WOULD DEFINITELY.
>> THE TWO THINGS THAT HE LOVES

848
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THE MOST.
AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT HIS

849
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
FAMILY, HE WAS EMOTIONAL.

850
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAD PREPARED A
SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR HIM, THAT WE

851
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
WERE ABLE TO PLAY FOR SERGEANT

852
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
BERNDT.
AND WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT

853
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HAPPENED.
>> HI, HONEY.

854
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
WE LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU.
WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

855
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
WE HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A MERRY

856
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
CHRISTMAS AND THAT YOU COME HOME

857
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SOON.

858
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
>> HI, DADDY.

859
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I LOVE AND MISS YOU AND HAVE A

860
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

861
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
>> MERRY CHRISTMAS!

862
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
LOVE YOU.
BYE!

863
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
>> GOOD.

864
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
>> THEY MISS YOU.
>> I MISS THEM TOO.

865
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOUR WIFE WAS

866
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
REALLY STRONG.

867
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
>> YEAH.
>> SHE --

868
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART ABOUT

869
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
NOT BEING WITH HER?

1041
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
SO, FAWZIA, YOU WANT YOUR

1042
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
DAUGHTERS TO STAY AFTER U.S.
LEAVES.

1043
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
STAY IN AFGHANISTAN.
>> THEY WILL STAY HERE.

1044
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
BUT IF THINGS, GOD FOR BID, IF
THINGS GO REALLY BAD, I THINK

1045
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THAT WE WILL HAVE NO OPTION.

1046
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE

1047
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
U.S. LEAVES?

1048
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000

HE'S FULL OF WIRE AND ALL OF
THOSE EXPLOSIVES.

1054
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT HE IS A

1055
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SICK PERSON, ASKING FOR MY HELP.
THAT'S AN INDICATION OF HOW

1056
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN HAVE

1057
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
PROBLEMS AND HOW MUCH, BY DOING

1058
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
SMALL THINGS FOR THEM, THEY

1059
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
BECOME HAPPY AND THAT'S OUR JOB
TO DO SMALL THINGS.

1060
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> AS A WOMAN, DO YOU THINK A

1061
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
LOT OF THE, SOME OF THE
ACHIEVEMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED,

1062
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
GIRLS GOING TO SCHOOL AND MORE

1063
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
WOMEN WORKING, WOMEN LIKE YOU,
BEING ABLE TO BE IN PARLIAMENT

1064
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
NOW, YOU'VE GOT MORE WOMEN IN

1065
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
PARLIAMENT, 27% OR 22, IT'S ONLY

1066
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
18% IN THE U.S., SO IT'S BEEN
REAL PROGRESS.

1067
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
DO YOU THINK A LOT OF THAT IS
GOING TO BE ROLLED BACK OR GO

1068
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
AWAY WHEN THE U.S. LEAVES, OR DO

1069
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
YOU THINK AFGHANISTAN WILL KEEP

1070
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THAT?
>> WE ARE WORRIED THAT PERHAPS

1071
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
IN MANY PLACES, TALIBAN CLOSED
SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS, ESPECIALLY IN

1072
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THE SOUTH, AND RECENTLY, YOU ARE

1073
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
AWARE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS,
ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AND

1074
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
NORTHEAST, BEING POISONED BY

1075
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
TALIBAN.
SO WE KNOW THEIR INTENTION.

1076
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
AND WE ARE WORRIED THAT ONCE THE

1077
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LEAVES,
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE

1078
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
COME AFTER, AS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF

1079
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THE 2001, WOULD BE UNDERMINED BY
SECURITY AND BY THE SYMPATHY TO

1080
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
BRING TALIBAN BACK TO POWERS.

1081
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
>> AND ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR

1082
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
PRESIDENT?
I KNOW PEOPLE SAY, LOOK, IT'S A

1083
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
LONG SHOT.
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE,

1084
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
ANYWAY AND GO OUT WITH THE

1085
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
PUBLIC SPEECHES?

1086
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY RISK TO THAT,
BUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

1087
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
DETERMINED TO DO?

1088
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
>> I DON'T WANT BUY THIS
ARGUMENT, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THERE

1089
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
IS NO CHANCE.
IT'S JUST THE MIND-SET, IF A

1090
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
WOMAN HAS A CHANCE IN OTHER

1091

BIG PROBLEMS, MAYBE THEY DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

YOUR WORRIES ABOUT SCHOOL?

1108
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO
BE THE SAME NEXT YEAR WHEN THE

1109
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
U.S. LEAVES, THAT YOU WILL BE

1110
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
ABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL?
ARE YOU WORRIED THERE COULD BE

1111
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
CHANGES THAT HAPPEN FAST?

1112
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> I THINK THERE COULD BE
CHANGES.

1113
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
MAYBE TALIBAN COME AGAIN AND
MAYBE NOT.

1114
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I DON'T KNOW REALLY.
BUT I HOPE THEY DON'T COME.

1115
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
>> I KNOW YOU WENT TODAY AND

1116
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
HEARD YOUR MOM SPEAK.
>> YES.

1117
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK?
>> I THINK SHE REALLY -- SHE WAS

1118
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
GOOD AND THAT I'M PROUD OF HER.

1119
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I'M PROUD OF BEING HER DAUGHTER.
AND THE SPEECH WAS REALLY NICE.

1120
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
>> THANK YOU, GUYS, VERY MUCH.

1121
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> A SPACE ENGINEER AND

1122
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
PRESIDENT.
THAT WAS AN INSPIRING MOMENT FOR

1123
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ME TO SEE THOSE GIRLS.

1124
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
AND AS YOU OBVIOUSLY NOTICED,
THEY ARE VERY DEDICATED TO THEIR

1125
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
EDUCATION.
AND WHEN WE WHERE ARE THERE, WE

1126
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SAW THEM UP IN THEIR ROOMS

1127
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WORKING.
THEY WERE STUDYING.

1128
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR IT MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYONE AT HOMES

1129
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT MEANS,

1130
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
STUDYING IN 30 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT
WEATHER, NO HEAT, WORKING AND

1131
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL.

1132
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE ON
AFGHANISTAN.

1133
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE, BUT DOES

1134
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THIS MEAN THAT EVEN YOU, WHO HAS
BEEN A HERO FOR WOMEN AND

1135
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
INSPIRATION, A FIGHTER, THE

1136
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
WORLD, THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WOULD
THEY DEFINE YOU AS CORRUPT,

1137
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
EVERY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

1138
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
CORRUPT, GIVEN THESE OVERALL
NUMBERS THAT WE SEE?

1139
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING?
>> I THINK, YES.

1140
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
WELL, 20% OF THE FANS WHO ARE

1141
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
COMING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF
AFGHANISTAN, 80% ARE BEING SPENT

1142
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL

1143
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
ORGANIZATIONS.
SO NOT ONLY IN THE BROADER

1144
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
PICTURE AS THE GOVERNMENT OF
AFGHANISTAN, ALTHOUGH I AM NOT

1145
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
IN POWER, IN A WAY THAT I AM NOT

1146
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
IN POSITION, WE ARE THE CRITICS

1147
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE
REFORMISTS, WE WOULD LIKE TO

1148
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
BRING CHANGES.
I AGREE IN A WAY THAT THERE IS

1149
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
CORRUPTION.

1150
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
NOT ONLY MONEY CORRUPTION, BUT

1151
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
ALSO POLITICAL CORRUPTION,

1152
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION.
ALL OF THAT IS THERE.

1153
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
>> FAWZIA HAS TWO YOUNG
DAUGHTERS.

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
>> A SPACE ENGINEER AND
PRESIDENT.

1208
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THAT WAS AN INSPIRING MOMENT FOR

1209
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
ME TO SEE THOSE GIRLS.

1210
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
AND AS YOU OBVIOUSLY NOTICED,

1211
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THEY ARE VERY DEDICATED TO THEIR

1212
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
EDUCATION.

1213
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
AND WHEN WE WHERE ARE THERE, WE

1214
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
SAW THEM UP IN THEIR ROOMS

1215
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
WORKING.
THEY WERE STUDYING.

1216
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR IT MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYONE AT HOMES

1217
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT MEANS,

1218
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
STUDYING IN 30 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT

1219
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
WEATHER, NO HEAT, WORKING AND

1220
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL.

SOME TIME WITH HER FATHER
TALKING ABOUT HIS LIFE HERE WHEN

1292
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
AFGHANISTAN WAS A TOTALLY

1293
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
DIFFERENT PLACE.

1294
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
IN THE 1960s AND '70s,

1295
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
AFGHANISTAN WAS A CULTURAL
HOTBED, ATTRACTING THE LIKES OF

1296
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
JAZZ GREATS DUKE ELLINGTON AND

1297
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
DAVE BRUBECK.

EXPERIENCED KABUL IN ITS HEYDAY
WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN.

1303
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
>> OUR HOUSE WAS A PLACE WHERE

1304
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
ALL THE ARTISTS, INTELLECTUALS

1305
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, WOULD

00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
BE WELCOMED AND AFGHAN

1307
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000

>> YOU HAD THE SALON OF KABUL.

1310
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1311
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
>> BUT IN 1978, FAIZ AND HIS

1312
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000

INVASION.

1315
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
>> IT SADDENS ME THAT ON THE

1316
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
SPOT THAT I HAD BUILT A STAGE
FOR DUKE ELLINGTON TO PERFORM IS

1317
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
THAT AWFUL FOOTAGE PLAYED ALL

1318
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
OVER THE WORLD OF A WOMAN BEING

1319
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
HOSTED PRESIDENTS AND

1322
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
DIGNITARIES BUT BECAME AN ARENA
FOR PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.

1323
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
UNDER THE TALIBAN.

RETURNED BUT AFTER MORE THAN 30

1326
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
YEARS OF WAR AND OPPRESSION,
FAIZ SAYS KABUL IS NOT WHAT IT

1327
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
ONCE WAS.

1328
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
FOUR YEARS AGO HE WENT BACK AND

1329
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
FOUND HIS ONCE PALATIAL

1330
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000

1331
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
>> WHEN YOU FIRST WENT BACK AND

1332
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
SAW WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WAS THAT

1333
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
MOMENT LIKE?

1334
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
>> IT WAS A VERY, VERY SAD

1335
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000

1337
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
DOWN AND TURNED INTO A WEDDING

THERE'S A SMALL SIGN OF HOPE FOR
