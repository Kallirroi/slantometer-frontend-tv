1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
INTO CHAOS AND RETREAT, BUT THEY

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
ARE FAILED.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
OUR COUNTRY IS STRONG.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
>> THOSE WHO DIED HERE, THOSE

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
WHO SAVED LIFE HERE, THEY HELP

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
ME BELIEVE.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP ALL

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
EVIL IN THE WORLD, BUT I KNOW

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
THAT HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO US.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR ALL OUR

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
IMPERFECTIONS WE ARE FULL OF
DECENCY AND GOODNESS AND THE

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
FORCES THAT DIVIDE US ARE NOT AS

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
STRONG AS THOSE THAT UNITE US.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
>>> I'M WOLF BLITZER.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
FAREED ZAKARIA "GPS" WILL NOT BE

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
SEEN THIS WEEKEND.
WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEWERS

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
THE WORLD.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS, WE'VE

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SEEN A FATHER TRY TO PUT HIS

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IMMEASURABLE PAIN INTO WORDS.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
>> MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
FAMILIES THAT LOST A CHILD

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
YESTERDAY.
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
PERSON SHE IS.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
WAS.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
>> WE'VE ALSO SEEN PARENTS

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TRYING TO FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THEIR GRATITUDE AND THEIR

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
RELIEF.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
>> WE'RE VERY LUCKY THAT ALL THE

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
CHILDREN, MY SON INCLUDED, HAD

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO REACT

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
APPROPRIATELY AND THEY BASICALLY

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
RAN RIGHT NEXT TO THE GUY AND

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
OUT THE DOOR.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
>> THERE WILL BE MORE WORDS,

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THERE WILL BE MORE STORIES TODAY

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
AS NEWTOWN AND THE REST OF THE

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
NATION TRY TO MAKE SOME SENSE

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY THAT TOOK

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THE LIVES OF 20 CHILDREN.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'M JOINED THIS HOUR BY CNN'S

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SOLEDAD?

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, WOLF.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THIS MORNING, CONNECTICUT'S

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL BE

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
PERFORMING AUTOPSIES ON THE

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA AND ON HIS

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
MOTHER, AS WELL, WHO WAS KILLED

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AT HER HOME.
THE RESULTS OF THOSE AUTOPSIES

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WE'RE EXPECTING TO BE RELEASED

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT WILL

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BE HELD LATER TODAY.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
ALSO TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BE IN NEWTOWN.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
HE WILL SPEAK AT A MEMORIAL

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
SERVICE.
BEFORE THAT SERVICE, HE WILL

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND ALSO WITH

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
FIRST RESPONDERS, AS WELL.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WE KNOW THE NAMES WERE MADE

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PUBLIC LAST NIGHT.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
12 GIRLS, 8 BOYS KILLED IN ALL.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
EITHER 6 OR 7 YEARS OLD AND 6

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ADULTS KILLED AT THE SCHOOL, AS

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
WELL.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THEY WERE ALL WOMEN.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID THE

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
PRIMARY WEAPON IN THE MASSACRE

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WAS A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE THAT

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE AND EVERY

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
VICTIM HE EXAMINED, WHICH WERE
SEVEN VICTIMS, HAD BEEN HIT MORE

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THAN ONCE.
ONE CASE 1 1 TI1 TIMES.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
HE PENETRATED THE SCHOOL

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
BUILDING BY LITERALLY SHOOTING

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
HIS WAY INTO THE ENTRANCE WITH

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AN ASSAULT WEAPON.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
WOLF?
>> SOLEDAD, THE DAY BEFORE A

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
GUNMAN MASSACRED 20 SCHOOL

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOMS ALL

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AGES 6 OR 7, FIRST GRADERS RIGHT

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
LAWMAKERS IN MICHIGAN PASSED A

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS IN

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SCHOOLS, DESPITE THE OBJECS OF

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THE SCHOOL STATE BOARDS.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
IN ILLINOIS THEY STRUCK DOWN A

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BAN ON CARRYING CONCEALED

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
WEAPONS.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
IN FLORIDA, OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THEY WOULD SOON ISSUE THEIR

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
MILLIONTH CONCEALED WEAPON AND

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FIREARM LICENSE.

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
AS THE COUNTRY ABSORBS ANOTHER

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
MASS SHOOTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
USED HIS WEEKLY SATURDAY ADDRESS

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
TO REPEAT HIS CALL FOR CHANGE.

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
>> ANY OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
COULD BE OUR OWN.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SO WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION TO PREVENT

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
HAPPENING, REGARDLESS OF
POLITICS.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> BUT THAT WILL BE A TOUGH SELL

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
FOR SOME GUN CONTROL OPPONENTS.

120
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> THE SIMPLE FACTS ARE, GUNS

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
EXIST.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THEY ARE ESPECIALLY 1800

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
TECHNOLOGY.
THEY'RE EASY TO MAKE, THEY'RE

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THEY LAST SEVERAL HUMAN

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
LIFETIMES WITH MINIMAL

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
MAINTENANCE.

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SO, SINCE GUNS EXIST AND WE

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
KNOW, FOR A FACT, THAT THE ONLY

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WAY TO STOP AN EVIL PERSON LIKE

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE PERSON YOU WERE DISCUSSING

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
EARLIER IN THE SHOW IS TO SHOOT

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
HIM.
>> JOINING US NOW FROM THE TIME

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
WARNER CENTER IN NEW YORK

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE JERRY

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
NADLER OF NEW YORK WHO SAYS THE

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
TIME FOR MORE STRICT GUN CONTROL

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
IS RIGHT NOW.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
CONGRESSMAN, THANKS VERY MUCH

140
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
FOR COMING IN.

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
"MEANINGFUL ACTION RIGHT NOW"

143
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

144
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
>> WELL, I WANT THE PRESIDENT TO

145
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TAKE THE LEADERSHIP AND USE THE

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
BULLY PULPIT OF THE PRESIDENCY

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
TO LEAD A CRUSADE FOR MEANINGFUL

148
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AND STRONG GUN CONTROL

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
LEGISLATION.
YOU KNOW, THE UNITED STATES --

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
DO IT, REALLY.

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WE KNOW GUN LOBBY HAS STRONG

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SUPPORT IN CONGRESS BECAUSE

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE

155
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TERRIFIED OF THEIR ALLEGED

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
POLITICAL POWER.

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
BUT A PRESIDENT CAN LEAD A

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
CAMPAIGN AND CAN DIRECT THE

159
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MORAL OF THE COUNTRY AND MEMBERS

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OF CONGRESS OR SENATORS REFUSE

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
TO SUPPORT STRONG GUN CONTROL

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
LEGISLATION.
AND WE KNOW IT, WE'VE HEARD ALL

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THE NONSENSE.

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> CONGRESSMAN, SORRY FOR

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
INTERRUPTING, BUT HOW

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
DISAPPOINTED ARE YOU THAT IN HIS

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
FIRST TERM THIS WAS NOT A HIGH

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PRIORITY FOR HIM, IF A PRIORITY

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
AT ALL?
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THAT.
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS WHAT

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HAPPENS NOW.
THE PRESIDENT HAD A LOT OF

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THINGS ON HIS PLATE.
HE HAD A DEPRESSION AND

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
OBSTRUCTIONIST CONGRESS.
IF THE PRESIDENT STEPS UP AND

174
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
LEADS THE CRUSADE AND WE SAVE,

175
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
GOD KNOWS HOW MANY LIVES BY

176
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
GETTING SOMETHING DONE, THAT

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WILL BE GREAT.
THAT WILL BE A MONUMENT TO HIS

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ADMINISTRATION.

179
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> YOU'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR A

180
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
LONG TIME, SO, WHAT'S REALISTIC?

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK, WHAT KIND OF

182
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
LEGISLATION CAN BE PASSED BY THE

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SENATE AND THE HOUSE, THE

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PRESIDENT WOULD SIGN IT INTO LAW

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THAT IS REALISTIC GIVEN THE

186
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OPPOSITION.
>> WELL, I THINK WE CAN GET LAWS

187
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TO BAN AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND NO

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
HUNTER NEEDS AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
TO SHOOT AT BIRDS OR DEER OR

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
WHATEVER.

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
WE CAN BAN HIGH-CAPACITY

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
AMMUNITION CLIPS.

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THAT HAVE NO USE EXCEPT BY THE

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
MILITARY OR FOR MASS MURDER.

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WE CAN PASS LEGISLATION TO LIMIT

196
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
GUN TRAFFICKING, SO NO ONE, SO A

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
GUN SHOP CAN'T SELL MORE THAN A

198
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
SPECIFIED NUMBER OF GUNS AT A

199
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
TIME.

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WE CAN BAN THE GUN SHOW

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
EXCEPTION.

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AT A GUN SHOW, UNLIKE AT A GUN

203
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
STORE, YOU CAN SELL ANYTHING,

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
YOU CAN SELL AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AND YOU CAN SELL HIGH-CAPACITY

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
CLIPS TO ANYONE WITHOUT A

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BACKGROUND CHECK.

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
NO ONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND THINKS

209
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

210
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
PROBLEMS OR PEOPLE ON THE

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
TERRORISM LIST OR PEOPLE WHO ARE

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
FELONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
DEADLY WEAPONRY.

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
LET ME JUST SAY, I KNOW THAT

215
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE PEOPLE ON

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THIS SHOW LATER OR MAYBE THERE

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WERE WHO WILL SAY THAT GUNS

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
DON'T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
PEOPLE AND YOU SHOULD ARM MORE

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
PEOPLE AND THAT WILL STOP THE

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CROOKS.

222
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THERE WAS A MANIAC ON FRIDAY WHO

224
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ATTACKED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

225
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
CHINA WITH A KNIFE, NOT A GUN.

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
22 CHILDREN WERE INJURED.

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
NOBODY DIED.

228
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
WE HAVE 9,000, 1,146 MURDERS

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WITH GUNS IN THE UNITED STATES

230
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
OR DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES A

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
COUPLE YEARS AGO.

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
GERMANY HAD 158.

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
CANADA 173.

234
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THE UNITED STATES HAS 15 TIMES

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE ON A

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
POPULPO

237
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
POPULATION BASIS.
THERE IS ONE REASON AND ONE

238
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
REASON ONLY, INSANE ATTITUDE

239
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TOWARDS GUNS.

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE NRA SHOULD STOP, THEY WON'T.

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WE SHOULD STOP THEM FROM BEING

242
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ENABLERS OF MASS MURDER.

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> BEING THE NATIONAL RIFLE

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
ASSOCIATION.

245
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
CONGRESSMAN, THANKS VERY MUCH

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
>> THANK YOU.

248
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
>> JERRIEY EDJERRY.

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
>>> FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST AT

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THE U.S. SENTENCING COMMISSION
AND AUTHOR OF THE THIRD EDITION

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
OF THE BOOK "MORE GUNS, LESS

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
CRIMES."
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
IN.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

254
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
RESPOND.
THE UNITED STATES HAS A LOT MORE

255
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
MURDERS, YOU JUST HEARD FROM

256
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
CONGRESSMAN NADLER.

257
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HE SAID IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SO MANY GUNS THAT ARE SO EASIIL

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AVAILABLE OUT THERE.

260
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> WELL, YOU LOOK AT THE MURDER

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
RATES IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHETHER IF BE GERMANY HE JUST

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
MENTIONED OR OTHERS AND THEY HAD

264
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
LOWER MURDER RATES RELATIVE TO

265
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THEY

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
HAD THE GUN CONTROL LAWS.

267
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHEN BRITAIN, OTHER COUNTRIES,

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IRELAND, JAMAICA, OTHER PLACES

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
IMPOSED GUN BANS, MURDER RATES

270
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WENT UP.

271
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AMERICANS HAVE SEEN THAT IN

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
PLACES LIKE CHICAGO AND
WASHINGTON, D.C.

273
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
EVERY PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT WE

274
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HAVE CRIME DATA BOTH BEFORE AND

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AFTER A GUN BAN HAS GONE INTO

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
EFFECT, EVERY SINGLE PLACE HAS

277
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SEEN AN INCREASE IN MURDERS

278
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AFTER THE BAN HAS BEEN PUT IN

279
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
PLACE.
MANY TIMES, IT'S BEEN SEVERAL

280
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
FOLD OR MORE INCREASE IN

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
MURDERS.

282
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
A SIMPLE REASON FOR THAT.

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THAT IS WHEN YOU BAN GUNS, IT'S

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
BASICALLY THE MOST LAW ABIDING

285
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
CITIZENS WHO TURN IN THEIR GUNS,

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
NOT THE CRIMINALS.

287
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND RATHER THAN MAKING MORE

288
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
DIFFICULT FOR CRIMINALS TO

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
COMMIT CRIME, YOU ACTUALLY MAKE

290
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
IT EASIER.

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
LEGISLATION THAT THE CONGRESSMAN

293
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
WOULD LIKE TO SEE PASSED.

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
TIGHTENING UP SOME OF THESE

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
RESTRICTIONS.

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT, FOR

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
EXAMPLE, FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE

298
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
TO GO OUT THERE AND BUY SOME

299
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> WOLF, I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
CHALLENGED THEM A LITTLE BIT ON

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
CLAIMS ABOUT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS HE

304
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
WAS MAKING.
YOU KNOW THAT THESE AREN'T

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
INVOLVED IN ANY OF THESE TYPES

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
OF CASES THAT WE'RE TALKING

307
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
ABOUT HERE.
BUT THE POINT IS, WE'VE TRIED A

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
LOT OF THESE LAWS ALREADY IN THE

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
UNITED STATES.

310
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
WE HAD THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THERE'S NO STUDY, NO ACADEMIC

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
STUDY BY AN ECONOMIST OR BY

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
CRIMINOLOGISTS THAT HAS SEEN

314
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WHEN THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

315
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE WAS ANY INCREASE IN MURDER

316
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
RATES.
YOU CAN GO FROM POLITICIANS FROM

317
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND CHUCK

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SCHUMER AND OTHERS WHO WERE

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
PREDICTING HUGE INCREASES IN

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
MURDERS AND ROBBERIES AFTER

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SUNSETS.
ROBBERERALTIES ARE LOWER NOW

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

323
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OTHERWISE.

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
EVEN WHEN THE CLINTON

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
ADMINISTRATION PAID FOR

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
ACADEMICS TO GO LOOK AT THE

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
IMPACT OF THE ORIGINAL ASSAULT

328
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WEAPONS BAN IN 1994, THEY DID

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
NOT FIND ANY STATISTICAL

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
EVIDENCE THAT IT HAD IMPROVED

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
CRIME RATES IN ANY WAY.

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AND, YOU KNOW, SO, WE'RE

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TALKING --
>> LET ME INTERRUPT FOR A

334
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
SECOND, MR. LOTT.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THE DUSHMASTER A SEMI-AUTOMATIC

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
RIFLE THAT APPARENTLY KILLED ALL

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THE KIDS AND THE TEACHERS IN THE

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
SCHOOL.

340
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
>> RIGHT.

341
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND HE WAS SAYING

342
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AUTOMATIC.
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
BETWEEN A MACHINE GUN AND

344
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SOMETHING THAT IS A HUNTING

345
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
RIFLE.
LOOK, REGULAR CIVILIANS.

346
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
>> WHY DO PEOPLE NEED A

347
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC BUSHMASTER TO GO

348
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
OUT AND KILL DEER?

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
>> LOOK, MOST HUNTING RIFLES ARE

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLES.

351
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OKAY.
PEOPLE USED SEMI-AUTOMATIC --

352
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
>> IS THE BUSHMASTER A HUNTING

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
RIFLE?
IS THE BUSHMASTER A HUNTING

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
RIFLE?
>> RIGHT.

355
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THE INSIDE GUTS OF IT IN TERMS

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
OF HOW IT FUNCTIONS IS A HUNTING

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
RIFLE.

358
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THE OUTSIDE OF IT IS WHAT PEOPLE

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
GET UPSET ABOUT, BUT WHETHER --

360
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
USING AN AK .47 IN ONE OF THESE

362
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ATTACKS, NOT THE TYPE OF GUN

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
MILITARIES USE AROUND THE WORLD.

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THIS IS A MILITARY VERSION.

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
LONG ENOUGH, YOU KNOW THESE ARE

367
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
CIVILIAN VERSIONS OF THESE GUNS.

368
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
LOOK, WHEN CIVILIANS -- IT'S

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FOR

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
DEFENSE.
IF YOU HAD A SINGLE SHOTGUN AND

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
TWO CRIMINALS ATTACKING YOU OR

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME YOU

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
FIRED AT A CRIMINAL, YOU'D BE IN

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
A LOT OF TROUBLE AT THAT POINT.

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
SO, IF YOU WANT TO GO AND TALK

377
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
ABOUT BANNING THE VAST MAJORITY

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
OF GUNS, WHICH IS

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC, FINE, WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THE COSTS AND

380
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
BENEFITS OF DOING THAT.

381
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
HERE'S THE BIG THING THAT NOBODY

382
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
IS TALKING ABOUT.

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
THAT IS, ALL THESE ATTACKS ARE

384
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
OCCURRING IN PLACES WHERE WE BAN

385
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
GUNS.
YOU KNOW, YOU GO AND LOOK AT THE

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
AURORA, COLORADO, SHOOTING.

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THERE WERE SEVEN MOVIE THEATERS

388
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
WITHIN A 20-MINUTE DRIVE OF

389
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
THAT, OF WHERE THE KILLER LIVED.

390
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
ONLY ONE OF THE SEVEN HAD

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
POSTINGS BANNING CONCEALED

392
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
HANDGUN PERMITS.

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE MOVIE

394
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THEATER CLOSEST TO HIS HOME.

395
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE LARGEST

396
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
MOVIE THEATER.

397
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
HE WENT TO THE ONLY ONE THAT

398
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
BANNED GUNS.

399
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
WHETHER IT'S THE PORTLAND MALL

400
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000

402
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THESE CASES BAN GUNS.

403
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> MR. LOTT, I HAVE TO INTERRUPT

404
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
YOU BECAUSE , UNFORTUNATELY, WE

405
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ARE OUT OF TIME.

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
YOU MADE YOUR CASE, WE MADE YOUR

407
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
POINT.
I EXPECT THIS DEBATE OVER GUNS

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
IN THE UNITED STATES IS ONLY

409
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
JUST BEGINNING.

410
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY PRESIDENT

411
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WILL BE ON HIS WAY HERE TO

412
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
NEWTOWN IN A FEW HOURS.

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I SUSPECT HE WILL GET INVOLVED

414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
MUCH MORE ASSERTIVELY IN HIS

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SECOND TERM OF ADMINISTRATION

416
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAN HE DID IN HIS FIRST TERM.

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
>>> WHEN WE RETURN, COMFORTING

418

419
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
MY INTERVIEW WITH MEMBERS OF

420
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
NEWTOWN'S CLERGY.

421
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY WHO WILL

422
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
BE WITH THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT.

423
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>> THIS TIME, I THINK THAT'S ALL

424
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
THE CLERGY WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER

425
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
CARE TO WHOMEVER.

426
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

427
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
THAT'S WHY WE'RE STANDING HERE

428
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
TODAY, REALLY, BECAUSE WE KNOW

429
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'RE

430
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
UNITED IN OUR CARE FOR THIS

431
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
COMMUNITY.

432
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Capella University understands
rough economic times

433
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
have led to an increase in
clinical depression.

434
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Drug and alcohol abuse is up.

435
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And those dealing with grief
don't have access to the

436
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
professional help they need.

437
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When you see these issues, do
you want to walk away or
step up?

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
With a degree in the field of
Counseling or Psychology from

439
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Capella University, you'll have
the knowledge to make

440
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000

At first, Jake's family
thought they saved Ziggy,

458
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
but his connection with Jake
has been a lifesaver.

459
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
For a love this strong,
his family only feeds him Iams.

463

552
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING, THE

553
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
SHOOTER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

554
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
GREW UP IN A CULTURE OF

555
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
VIOLENCE?
>> YES, THAT OUR ENTIRE

556
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
CIVILIZATION IS TOO INUNDATED

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
WITH THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE.

558
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
THAT THERE CAN BE AN INCENTIVE

559
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
AND A FUN GAME THAT HAS TO DO

560
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
WITH LEARNING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

561
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
AND THE WORLD AND DEALING WITH

562
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
GRIEVANCES THROUGH ACTIVE DIP  M

563
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
DIPLOMACY.
>> SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
ME, REVEREND AND RABBI, HOW CAN

565
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
GOD ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO

566
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
HAPPEN?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

567
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I FIRST SAY

568
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
IN THIS MOMENT IS THAT THIS IS

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
NOT THE MOMENT TO ANSWER THAT

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
QUESTION.
AT LEAST NOT TO THE FAMILIES

571
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
THAT ARE IN GRIEF.

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I THINK THERE ARE ANSWERS.

573
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THERE ARE ANSWERS FROM MY

574
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
TRADITION THAT SPEAK TO
SUFFERING AND HOW SUFFERING CAN

575
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
BE TRANSFORMATIVE.

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
HOW AS A CHRISTIAN I UNDERSTAND

577
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE

578
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
CAN TRANSFORM AND BE TRANSFORMED

579
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
IN THE MIST OF SUFFERING.

580
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION I TRY TO

581
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
ANSWER TODAY BECAUSE PEOPLE

582
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
DON'T NEED TO HEAR WHAT BECOMES

583
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
AN OVERSIMPLISTIC ANSWER TO

584
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
SOMETHING THAT IS SO PROFOUND.

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
>> WHAT WILL BE THE CENTRAL

586
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
MESSAGE THAT YOU TELL YOUR

587
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
CONGRUGNTS TOMORROW MORNING?

588
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
>> I WILL BE PREACHING A MESSAGE

589
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THAT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
DARKNESS, THERE IS LIGHT.

591
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
IT'S TRAGIC THAT WE ARE IN THE

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
MIDST OF THE SEASON FOR US AS

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
CHRISTIANS, WHICH IS

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
CHRISTMASTIME AND ADVENT AND

595
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
IT'S A HOLY TIME FOR US, BUT WE

596
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE MIDST OF A

597
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SEASON THAT SO OFTEN WE

598
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
ASSOCIATE WITH JOY AND MERRIMENT

599
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
THAT IT'S ALSO A SEASON OF

600
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
DARKNESS.

601
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
IN FACT, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN

602
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
TELLS US THAT THE LIGHT SHINES

603
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
IN THE DARKNESS AND THE DARKNESS

604
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
DOES NOT OVERCOME IT.

605
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I WILL BE PREACHING A MESSAGE

606
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
THAT WE KNOW THE LIGHT OF GOD IS

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
WITH US AND THAT WE CAN BE

608
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
SUSTAINED IN THAT AND WE CAN SEE

609
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THAT LIGHT IN EACH OTHER AND

610
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
DRAW FROM THAT LIFE THAT IS A

611
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
PART OF OUR FAITH.

612
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT

613
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
WE CAN DO AS A REACTION TO THIS

614
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
IS TO THRIVE.

615
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THE ENEMY IS THE HORRIBLE EVENT

616
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
AND THE BANQUET IS THE
CONTINUING OR THRIVING IN LIFE.

617
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR TEN YEARS

618
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
AND I SAW THE WAY THAT THE

619
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
ISRAELIS WOULD PICK UP AND GO

620
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
RIGHT TO THE SPOT WHERE

621
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED AND

622
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THE MESSAGE WAS WE CARRY ON AND

623
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WE WILL CARRY ON.

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
WE HAVE GREAT SCHOOLS IN

625
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
NEWTOWN.
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

626
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
THIS EVENT DOESN'T DEFINE US.

627
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GREAT

628
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
SCHOOLS AND BE THE GREAT

629
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
COMMUNITY.

630
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
MATTHEW AND I ARE GREAT FRIENDS

631
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
AND ALL OF THE CLERGY ARE GREAT

632
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
FRIENDS AND WE WILL RECOVER.

633
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
>> RABBI, REVEREND, THANKS SO

634
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
MUCH.

635
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> THANK YOU, WOLF.

636
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>>> THIS JUST IN.

637
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE,

638
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THEY WILL HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE

639
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
SOME TIME IN THE NEXT HOUR.

640
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
WE, OF COURSE, WILL BRING THAT

641
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
TO YOU LIVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

642
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WE'RE EXPECTING NEW INFORMATION

643
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
FROM THE CONNECTICUT STATE

644
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
POLICE ON THIS ENTIRE KILLING
AND WHAT HAPPENED.

645
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WHEN WE RETURN, MUCH MORE OF

646
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WHAT'S GOING ON, INCLUDING THE

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
HEALING PROCESS.

648
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
>> AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT

649
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

650
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
SO MANY PEOPLE LET IT NOT TURN

651
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

652
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

653
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

654
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

655
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
PEOPLE.

656
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
CAN I HELP YOU?

657
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I HEARD YOU GUYS CAN SHIP GROUND
FOR LESS THAN THE UPS STORE.

658
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

659
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'VE LEARNED THE ONLY WAY TO GET
A HOLIDAY DEAL IS TO CAMP OUT.

660
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN OPEN
ALL NIGHT.

661
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
IS THIS A TRICK
TO GET MY SPOT?

662
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY STRESS.

663
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
SAVE ON GROUND SHIPPING
AT FEDEX OFFICE.

664
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
>>> IN THE WAKE OF FRIDAY'S

665
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
SHOOTING, STUDENTS AT SANDY HOOK

666
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ARE BOUND TO

667
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS THAT

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
COULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR

669
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THEIR PARENTS TO ANSWER.

670
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
JOINING US THIS MORNING FROM

671
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
TIME WARNER CENTER IS DR. SUSAN

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
LIPKIN.

673
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
A SICIOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZED IN

674
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
SCHOOL.
SUSAN, IF I CAN, I'D LIKE TO

675
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
START WITH YOU.

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY REASSURE

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
CHILDREN.
THOSE CHILDREN HERE IN NEWTOWN,

678
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THOSE CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCED

679
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
SOMETHING HORRIFIC AND EVEN

680
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT HERE AND

681
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THEIR

682
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
SCHOOLS ARE SAFE WHEN THE

683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
REALITY IS SOMETHING TERRIBLE

684
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
HAPPENED.
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

685
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
TO TALK TO THE CHILD AT THEIR

686
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
LEVEL.

687
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TO GET THEM TO TALK, TO PLAY, TO

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
DRAW OUT EVERYTHING THAT IS IN

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
THEIR MIND SO YOU UNDERSTAND

690
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WHAT LEVEL THEY ARE AT AND AT

691
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO REASSURE

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
THEM.

693
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR

694
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
THE PARENTS' DEMEANOR TO BE

695
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
CALM, NOT TO BE ANXIOUS.

696
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
NOT TO BE CONSTANTLY WATCHING

697
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
THE NEWS AND TO FEEL SECURE IN

698
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE CHILDREN

699
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WILL MODEL THE FEELINGS THAT

700
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
THEY'RE GETTING FROM THEIR
PARENTS.

701
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
>> WHEN I TALKED TO SOME OF THE

702
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
PARENTS HERE WHOSE CHILDREN WERE

703
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
LITERALLY ABLE TO GET OUT OF

704
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THEIR CLASSROOMS, THEY WERE

705
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
GOING TO GO FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL

706
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
HELP.
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE, AGAIN, WHO

707
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
WERE NOT NECESSARILY IMMEDIATELY

708
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION.

709
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HOW WILL THEY DEAL WITH THE

710
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
PTSD, WOULD THEY EVEN EXPERIENCE

711
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
PTSD JUST BY BEING NEAR OR EVEN

712
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
NOT SO CLOSE TO THE SITUATION?

713
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
>> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL

714
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
EXPERIENCE MANY OF THE SYMPTOMS

715
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
OF STRESS AND MAYBE

716
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS.

717
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR THE FIRST

718
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
COUPLE OF WEEKS AND EVENTUALLY

719
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
IT WILL DIE DOWN AND IF IT DOES

720
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
NOT, THEN YOU SEEK PROFESSIONAL

721
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
CARE.
WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR CHILDREN

722
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
AND ADULTS WHO HAVE PROBLEMS

723
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
SLEEPING, WHO HAVE PSYCHOSEMATIC

724
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
SYMPTOMS LIKE HEADACHES AND

725
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
STOMACH ACHES AND WHO WOULD

726
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
REFUSE TO SEPARATE AND DO NORMAL

727
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ACTIVITIES.
REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET BACK TO

728
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
YOUR NORMAL ROUTINE AND GET BACK

729
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TO SCHOOL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

730
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

731
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
>> SO, KEN, LET'S TALK MORE

732
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

733
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER WAS

734
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
ABLE TO BASICALLY SHOOT HIS WAY

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
INTO THE SCHOOL.

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A SCHOOL

737
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
SAFE WITHOUT HAVING IT BE BEHIND

738
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
BARS, ESSENTIALLY?

739
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
>> WE DON'T NEED TO TEACH

740
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
KINDERGARTNERS TO THROW PENCILS

741
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
AN ARMED INTRUDERS.

742
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH KIDS

743
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
AND KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN

744
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
YOUR COMMUNITY WITH FAMILIES AND

745
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
HAVING BASIC SECURITY MEASURES,

746
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
LIKE WE SAW AT THE SCHOOL WITH

747
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
CAMERA BUZZER INTERCOM AND MAKE

748
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
SURE THAT YOUR STAFF IS TRAINED.

749
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THE BEST LINE OF DEFENSE IS A

750
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
WELL-TRAINED, HIGHLY ALERT STAFF

751
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
AND STUDENT BODY, NOT TECHNOLOGY

752
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
OR EQUIPMENT, BUT EQUIPMENT

753
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
BEHIND IT.

754
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
>> BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD

755
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
ALL OF THAT.

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
THAT SCHOOL SECURITY SYSTEM WAS

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
PUT IN PLACE BY THE NEW SCHOOL

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
PRINCIPAL, SHE IS NOW DEAD.

759
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEY WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
KNOWING THEIR STUDENTS.

761
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
>> SOME SITUATIONS YOU CAN'T

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
PREVENT.

763
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
BUT WHAT WE EXPECT AS PARENTS IS

764
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
TWO THINGS.

765
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
NUMBER ONE, SCHOOLS TO TAKE

766
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
STEPS TO REDUCE THE RISKS.

767
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE SECURITY MEASURES AND

768
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
TRAINING OF YOUR STAFF AND THE

769
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
LOCKDOWN DRILLS AND, TWO, BEING

770
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
PREPARED TO RESPOND WHEN AN

771
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
INCIDENT HAPPENS.

772
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
IF WE SAW A PRINCIPAL AND A

773
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
PSYCHOLOGIST RUN TO THE GUNMAN

774
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
TO TRY TO SAVE THEIR KIDS.

775
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IF

776
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WE CAN TRAIN PEOPLE TO DO, BUT

777
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SOMETHING VERY MUCH IN THE
HEARTS OF ALL OF OUR EDUCATORS

778
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
TODAY.
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN AND WE

779
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
REDUCE THE RISKS AND WE TRAIN

780
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO MINIMIZE

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
OUR LOSSES AND WE PLAN FOR THE

782
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
WORST AND PREPARE AND PRAY FOR

783
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
THE BEST.

784
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
>> THERE HAVE BEEN GUN LOBBYISTS

785
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
WHO HAVE BOTH WRITTEN AND BEEN

786
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
ON TELEVISION SHOWS TALKING

787
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
ABOUT HOW IF PEOPLE INSIDE THE

788
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
SCHOOL HAD BEEN ARMED, THAT THE

789
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
END RESULT COULD HAVE BEEN LESS

790
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HORRIFIC THAN WHAT THEY ARE

791
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
EXPERIENCING HERE NOW.

792
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
YOU'VE, OBVIOUSLY, BEEN IN THE

793
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
SECURITY BUSINESS FOR A LONG

794
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
TIME AS IT RELATES TO SCHOOLS.

795
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF

796
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THAT?
>> WE HAVE SCHOOL RESOURCE

797
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
OFFICERS, POLICE OFFICERS WHO

798
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
ARE IN OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

799
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
COUNTRY, NOT ALL SCHOOLS, BUT

800
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
SOME, AND WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT

801
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
THAT.

802
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
BUT TEACHERS WANT TO BE ARMED

803
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
WITH BACKPACKS OR WITH BOOKS,

804
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BO

805
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
BOOKBAGS, COMPUTERS, TECHNOLOGY.

806
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THEY DON'T WANT BULLETPROOF

807
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
BACKPACKS AND ARMED TO SHOOT.

808
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
WE NEED TO NOT POLITES IS THIS

809
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
ISSUE AT A TIME WHEN WE LOST

810
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
KIDS.

811
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
>> SUSAN, WE KNOW THIS YOUNG

812
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
MAN, THE SHOOTER, WE HAVE BEEN

813
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
CALLING HIM, WAS DISTURBED.

814
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
DESCRIPTIONS BY FAMILY MEMBERS,

815
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
AS WELL.
A LOT OF DETAILS STILL YET TO

816
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BEKNOWNBE

817
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OWN ABOUT HIM.

818
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH SOMEONE WHO

819
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
IS CONSIDERED TO BE DISTURBED

820
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS AND WE

821
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH

822
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
RESOURCES ARE HARD FOR FAMILIES

823
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
TO GET TO.

824
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
WE KNOW THAT GUNS ARE READILY

825
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

826
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
HOW DO YOU, HOW DO YOU STOP THAT

827
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
INTERSECTION, WHICH IS,

828
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
OBVIOUSLY, A DEADLY INTERSECTION

829
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
HAPPENING?
>> IT SEEMS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

830
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
IN MANY WAYS OUR MENTAL HEALTH

831
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

832
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
WE NEED COMMUNITY SERVICES SO

833
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THAT PEOPLE CAN BE REPORTED.

834
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THAT THERE IS A 24/7 HOTLINE FOR

835
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNSTABLE AND, FOR

836
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EXAMPLE, THAT THE PRINCIPAL

837
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
MIGHT HAVE REPORTED THE INCIDENT

838
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE DAYS

839
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
BEFORE AND HAVE SOMEBODY TO

840
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
INVESTIGATE.
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SERVICES

841
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
NOW.
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

842
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
NEED TO DEVELOP.

843
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> DR. SUSAN LIPKIN AND KEN

844
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR TALKING

845
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
WITH ME THIS MORNING.

846
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR

847
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
INSIGHT.

848
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
AS WOLF MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS

849
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AGO, WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS NEWS

850
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
CONFERENCE.

851
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

852
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
HAVE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB

853
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
COMING UP TO UPDATE US.

854
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WE ARE EXPECTING IT BETWEEN

855
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
11:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME AND

856
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
11:30.
>>> AHEAD, WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER

857
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
LOOK AT THIS KILLER AND ANSWER

858
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THE QUESTION THAT MANY ARE

859
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
ASKING, WHICH IS WHY.

860
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THAT'S STRAIGHT AHEAD.

861
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WE'RE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT.

862
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
mm .

863
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And cut! Very good.

864
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

865
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

866
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

867
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's not real.

868
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

869
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

870
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

871
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

872
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

873
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
MEMORIALS LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE

874
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE DOT MANY

875
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
OF THE CORNERS IN NEWTOWN,

876
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
CONNECTICUT.

877
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THEY'VE BEEN SET UP WHERE PEOPLE

878
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
LEAVE VOTIVE CANDLES OR NOTES OR

879
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
DOLLS OR TEDDY BEARS.

880
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THIS TOWN IS HURTING.

881
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
PEOPLE HERE ARE EXPERIENCING A

882
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
VERY, VERY DEEP GRIEF AND IT IS

883
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
A GRIEF THAT WE ARE SURE THE

884
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
PRESIDENT WILL TALK ABOUT AS HE

885
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
MAKES HIS WAY HERE TO TALK TO

886
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
FAMILY MEMBERS AND FIRST

887
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
RESPONDERS AND TAKE PART IN A

888
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
VIGIL THAT WILL BE HELD TONIGHT.

889
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
WE WANT TO GET TO DANA BASH IN

890
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
WASHINGTON, D.C., WITH A CHECK
OF THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING.

891
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
DANA, GOOD MORNING.

892
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
>> GOOD MORNING, SOLEDAD.

893
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THERE IS A POTENTIAL

894
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
BREAKTHROUGH IN STALLED FISCAL

895
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
CLIFF TALKS.

896
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER IS

897
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
OFFERING SOMETHING HE AND OTHER

898
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
REPUBLICANS OPPOSE.

899
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
RAISING TAX RATES ON THE

900
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.

901
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THAT'S A CONDITION PRESIDENT

902
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
OBAMA HAS INSISTED MUST BE PART

903
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
OF ANY DEAL TO AVERT THE FISCAL

904
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
CLIFF, WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE

905
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY.

906
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TAX HIKES OF

907
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
INCOMES ABOVE $250,000.

908
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THE INCREASE STARTS AT INCOMES

909
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
OF $1 MILLION IN EXCHANGE FOR

910
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THE PRESIDENT AGREEING TO MORE

911
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
SIGNIFICANT SPENDING CUTS.

912
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
>>> AND SECRETARY OF STATE

913
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS RECOVERING

914
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
FROM A CONCUSSION.

915
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
SHE SUSTAINED THE INJURY AFTER

916
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
FAINTING DURING A BOUT WITH THE

917
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
STOMACH FLU.
CLINTON IS BEING MONITORED BY

918
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000

JOHN KERRY WOULD BE UP THERE.

938
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000

ACTUALLY, THAT HE WOULD LOVE THE

ON CAPITOL HILL YOU KNOW THAT

SENATORS HAVE SAID THAT HE WOULD

943
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
BE EASILY CONFIRMED.

944
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE OF

945
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000

IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON BENGHAZI,

953
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT GOING TO

954
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
BE THERE, BUT JOHN KERRY IS THE

955
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS CHAIR.

956
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
HE IS STILL GOING TO CHAIR THAT

957
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
WE'RE SEEING MORE OF THESE YOUNG

1101
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
MEN, THEY'RE DRESSED IN MILITARY

1102
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
CLOTHING, IF YOU WILL, ARMORED

1103
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
VESTS.
THEY'RE DRESSED IN BLACK AND

1104
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THEY GO IN AND START KILLING

1105
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
PEOPLE.
IS THERE A CONNECTION, IN YOUR

1106
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
MIND, WHAT THEY CALL COPY CATS

1107
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
AS FAR AS THESE MASS KILLINGS

1108
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
ARE CONCERNED.

1109
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
>> WE LOOK AT COPY CATS AS

1110
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
SOMEBODY FOLLOWING AN EVENT.

1111
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
SOMEBODY ELSE KILLED A GROUP OF

1112
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO

1113
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
IT.
WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IN MOVIES OR

1114
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
VIDEO GAMES FOR MANY YEARS.

1115
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
IN THOSE SITUATIONS THEY'RE

1116
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
SEEING THE RAMBOS OF THE WORLD

1117
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
DRESSED UP IN BATTLE GEAR AND

1118
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
ASSAULT RIFLES AND SHOOTING A

1119
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
LOT OF PEOPLE.

1120
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
SO, IF THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVE

1121
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
THEIR MANHOOD, SO TO SPEAK, IN

1122
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THEIR DILUTIONAL WORLD, THAT MAY

1123
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
BE THEIR WAY TO SAY THEY'RE

1124
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
STRONG AND POWERFUL AND THEY'RE

1125
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
GOING TO PROVE IT TO THE WORLD

1126
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
BY CARRYING ON AS IF THEY'RE IN

1127
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THE SPECIAL FORCES OPERATION OR

1128
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
SOMETHING.

1129
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
>> CHIEF JOHNSON, DO YOU AGREE

1130
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT?

1131
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
>> I DO.

1132
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I THINK AMERICA CAN DO A LOT

1133
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
MORE ON THIS ISSUE.

1134
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THE NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP PREVENT

1135
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS CASE.

1136
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
WE KNOW THAT OVER 40% OF ALL

1137
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
GUNS ARE REQUIRED OUTSIDE OF

1138
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
DEALER SALES.
WE KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE A

1139
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
LIMIT ON HIGH-CAPACITY

1140
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
MAGAZINES.
I THINK AMERICA IS BECOMING MORE

1141
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
AWARE AND MORE EDUCATED ABOUT

1142
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

1143
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
HAVE LED TO THIS, FRANKLY,

1144
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

1145
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
HERE AND THE GUN VIOLENCE WE'RE

1146
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
EXPERIENCING ACROSS THIS GREAT

1147
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
NATION.

1148
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
>> WE EARLIER, TOM, HAD A DEBATE

1149
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
HERE.
WE HEARD FROM A CONGRESSMAN WHO

1150
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WANTS TIGHTER GUN RESTRICTIONS

1151
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
AND ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL SAYS THE
MORE GUNS OUT THERE, THE SAFER

1152
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
ALL OF US WILL BE.

1153
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN GOING ON

1154
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

1155
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
ALL OF OUR VIEWERS KNOW FOR A

1156
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
LONG TIME.
I EXPECT IT WILL INTENSIFY.

1157
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
TOM, WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE

1158
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
SHORT TERM TO DEAL WITH THIS

1159
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
PROBLEM?

1160
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
>> IN THE SHORT TERM, WE NEED TO

1161
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
TALK ABOUT IT.

1162
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
WE NEED TO GET OUR CONGRESS TO

1163
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
TALK ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT TO

1164
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
PURSUE IT, STATE LEGISLATURES TO

1165
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
ACTUALLY PURSUE IT AND NOT TREAT

1166
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
THIS LIKE IT'S THE THIRD RAIL OF

1167
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
POLITICS AND NOBODY CAN BRING IT

1168
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
UP BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE

1169
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
ELECTED.
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, THE

1170
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
CONGRESSMAN THAT HAVE JUST GOT

1171
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
ELECTED TO THE NEXT TERM ARE

1172
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
ALREADY PLANNING THEIR

1173
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
RE-ELECTION FOR TWO YEARS FROM

1174
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
NOW.

1175
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
SO, THERE'S A FEAR AMONG THEM TO

1176
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
TAKE THIS ISSUE ON AND END THEIR

1177
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
POLITICAL CAREERS BY TRYING TO

1178
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
TAKE ON THE POWERFUL GUN LOBBY

1179
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
OR SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION

1180
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED OUT THERE

1181
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
ABOUT GUN SAFETY.

1182
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I KNOW THE CHIEF AGREES WITH ME.

1183
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I WAS A STREET POLICE OFFICER

1184
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
FOR SIX YEARS BEFORE JOINING THE

1185
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
FBI.

1186
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
WHEN I WAS A 21-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE

1187
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
COP, WE WERE TAUGHT YOU DON'T

1188
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
FEAR THE BULLET OUT THERE THAT

1189
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
HAS YOUR NAME ON IT.

1190
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
YOU FEAR THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

1191
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
OF BULLETS THAT ARE DRESSED TO

1192
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.

1193
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THAT IS WHAT WE HAD IN THESE

1194
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1195
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

1196
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
SHOOTER SHOOTING HIS OWN MOTHER,

1197
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
THE REST OF THE SHOONGS, WHY

1198
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
WOULD HE BE TARGETING 5 AND 6

1199
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
YEAR OLDS AND AT THAT PARTICULAR

1200
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
SCHOOL.

1201
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
APPARENTLY, HE HAD NO CONNECTION

1202
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
TO.
SO, WE'RE SEEING THIS TREMENDOUS

1203
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
AMOUNT OF GUN VIOLENCE AND,

1204
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AGAIN, AS A FORMER STREET COP

1205
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
AND AN AGENT FOR 30 YEARS, LAW

1206
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000

1207
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
TO A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE

1208
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
BECAUSE THEY KNOW PEOPLE ARE

1209
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
HIGHLY EMOTIONAL, PROBABLY DRUNK

1210
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
AND ARMED AT THE SAME TIME.

1211
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
YOU HAVE THAT CONCERN MAKING

1212
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
TRAFFIC STOPS.

1213
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
SO, THE ISSUE OF OFFICER SAFETY,

1214
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
COMMUNITY SAFETY AND NOW THE

1215
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
SAFETY OF OUR OWN CHILDREN IS AT

1216
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
STAKE AND HAS BEEN AT STAKE.

1217
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THE CHIEF IS CORRECT, THIS IS A

1218
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
HEALTH ISSUE AS MUCH AS ANY

1219
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
OTHER TYPE OF ISSUE.

1220
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000

1221
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
A FINAL THOUGHT.

1222
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000

1223
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000

1224
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
