00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
IT IS ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
YOU HAVE TO PRY A LARGE-MOUTHED

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
BASS OFF GARY TUCHMAN'S NECK.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THIS ANCHOR WAS A PRO.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
NO HARM DONE.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT
CNBC STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
IF IT REALLY WANTS TO MAKE

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
HISTORY IN THE FINANCIAL NEWS

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> AT NO POINT WERE YOU RUNNING

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A GYM?
>> NO, NO.

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
RUNNING A GYM?

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
TO WORK OUT OR SOMETHING?

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
JESUS [ BLEEP ] CHRIST.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
WHAT.

24
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
>> OH!

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OH!

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
YEAH, THAT WAS ANDREW DICE CLAY

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BEING INTERVIEWED ON THE NOW

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DEFUNCT CNN-FN BY ALAN CHERNOFF

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
TRYING TO HOLD ON TO A FISH

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
WHILE STANDING IN A BOAT.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
>>> TODAY'S A SOLDIER WAS KILLED

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
IN KANDAHAR AFTER I VISITED

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
BASE.
IT IS A SAD REMINDER OF HOW

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
UNSAFE THIS COUNTRY REMAINS

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AFTER 11 YEARS OF WAR.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I WILL ASK THE SECRETARY WHAT

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
HAPPENED NEXT AS AMERICAN TROOPS

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
PREPARE IT LEAVE AFGHANISTAN AND

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR AL QAEDA,

THANKS FOR JOINING US.
A SOBERING REMINDER OF HOW

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
AMERICA'S WAR IS STILL NOT WON.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A SECURE

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
AFGHANISTAN.
TODAY, JUST HOURS AFTER I

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WRAPPED UP AN INTERVIEW WITH THE

AN AMERICAN SOLDIER HAS WITHIN

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
KILLED.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TWO AFGHAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AMERICANS AND AFGHANS WERE

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WOUNDED IN THIS ATTACK TODAY.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA NEXT MONTH.

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEADERS

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
IS WHERE DO THINGS NOW STAND AND

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
WHAT'S NEXT?

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000

DAYS.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000

FAULTER, AND WE WILL NOT FAIL.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
>> PEACE AND FREEDOM WILL

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
PREVAIL.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
>> JUST ONE MONTH AFTER 9/11 WBT

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WAR AGAINST THE TALIBAN AND AL

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000

AMERICANS DEAD AND MORE THAN

18,000 WOUNDED.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
642 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS SPENT.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AND AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF AFGHAN

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CIVILIANS KILLED.
AT LEAST 12,000 IN THE LAST FIVE

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YEARS.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WITH THAT SACRIFICE, CAME SOME

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
PROGRESS.

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THE TALIBAN WAS REMOVED FROM

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
POWER AND --

96

OPERATION THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN

COME HOME IN 2014, THE TALIBAN

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
IS RESURGING.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
JUST THIS WEEK, A MEMBER OF THE

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
NAVY'S ELITE S.E.A.L. TEAM 6,

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THE SAME GROUP WHO DIED TRYING

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
TO SAVE A DOCTOR ABDUCTED BY THE
TALIBAN.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
AFGHAN TROOPS AREN'T READY TO

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
FIGHT THEM.
DEVERSION RATES ARE HIGH AND THE

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
UNITE HE NATION REPORTS

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
POLICEMEN ARE JOINING THE T

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
TALIBAN.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
EXTREMIST IN THE AFGHAN SECURITY
FORCES HAVE KILLED 33 AMERICANS

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THIS YEAR.

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AND AFGHAN CIVILIANS FEAR THE

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
FUTURE.
>> Translator: I DON'T A HUNDRED

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
PERCENT BELIEVE THERE ARE

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NATIONAL ARMIES CAPABLE.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
EVERYDAY WE HEAR OUR SOLDIERS

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
ARE KILLED IN THE INSECURE

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
PROVINCES.
>> 11 YEARS, 6 MONTHS AND 2

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
DAYS.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
WHEN WILL THIS MISSION BE

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ACCOMPLISHED?

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THE ISSUE OF READINESS ON THE

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
PART OF AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
TO TAKE OVER THE FIGHT AGAINST

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AL QAEDA AND TERRORIST IN THIS

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
COUNTRY IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE TO

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
DETERMINE IF AMERICA STAYS AND

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HOW MANY AMERICAN TROOPS WILL

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THIS

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
COUNTRY.

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THERE WAS A NEW PENTAGON REPORT

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OUT THIS WEEK, IMPORTANT IT CAME

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
FROM THE PENTAGON.
THEY ARE TRYING TO TELL A STORY

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OF IMPROVEMENT HERE, BUT

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
PENTAGON REPORT ITSELF SAID THAT

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ONLY ONE UNDER 23 AFGHAN BRIGADE

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SAYS ACTUALLY READY TO TAKE OVER

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
SECURITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
AN ARMY WHERE 85% OF RECRUITS

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ARE ILL LITERAL.

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THE CHALLENGES CAN BE

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
OVERWHELMING.

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I SPOKE SPECIFICALLY NO LEON

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
PANETTA TODAY IN KANDAHAR AND

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS DAUNTING

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
CHALLENGE.

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
>> OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A, YOU

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
KNOW, A LITERACY PROBLEM WITH

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
REGARDS TO FORCES AND YOU KNOW,

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WE CONTINUE IT TRY TO PREPARE

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THEM FOR THE ABILITY TO TAKE

155
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OVER ALL OF THIS SECURITY

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
RESPONSIBILITIES.
I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THE GOOD NEWS

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE

158
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
TRAINING EFFORT, THEY ARE

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
DEALING WITH ILLITERACY AND

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PROVIDING QUICK CLASSES FOR

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT GO INTO

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THE ARMY, SO THEY ARE MEETING

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
THEY ARE DEVELOPING THE KIND OF

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
TRAINING AND CAPABILITY THAT

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THEY NEED.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BUT THIS IS AN AREA WE'RE JUST

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS ON

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
INTENSELY.
BECAUSE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS,

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AND PARTICULARLY IN 2013, WE

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HAVE TO REACH A STAGE WHERE A

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
OPERATIONS ARE IN THE HANDS OF

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THE AFGHAN ARMY.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT MORE

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WORK.

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> SO IS THAT WHY THERE'S BEEN A

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
BIT OF A DELAY?

178
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I WAS LOOKING AT HEADLINES A FEW

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WEEKS AGO AND SAID WE WOULD HAVE

180
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A TROOP COUNT DECISION IN A FEW

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WEEKS.
THE HEADLINES A COUPLE DAYS AGO

182
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WERE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A TROUPE

183
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DECISION IN A FEW WEEKS.

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
WHAT IS CAUSING THAT DELAY?

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ARE YOU NOT SURE OF THAT NUMBER?

186
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHERE IS THE DELAY?

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> NO, I THINK, YOU KNOW, I

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST, THAT

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
GENERAL ALAN HAVING DEVELOPED A

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN IS

191
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE ONE THAT HAS TO COME FORWARD

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WHAT ENDURING PRESENCE WILL LOOK

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
LIKE AN HE IS PREPARED SEVERAL

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OPTIONS.
WE HAVE REVIEWED THEM.

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BE PRESENTED TO THE NATIONAL

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH REVIEWS

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THEM AND THEP PRESENT IT TO THE

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
PRESIDENT FOR FINAL DECISION.

201
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT TAKES TIME AND WE WANT TO

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
MAKE SURE, OBVIOUSLY, THAT WE

203
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION WITH THE

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SLICE OF THAT ENDURING PRESENCE.

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORRY

206
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THAT U.S. WILL HAVE TOO FEW

207
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
PEOPLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY

208
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT'S REQUIRED.

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SOMEONE SAID THAT NUMBER IS

210
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
20,000.
ANYTHING FEWER THAN THAT IS NOT

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ENOUGH.
IS THAT FAIR?

212
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON THE

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
MISSIONS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE

214
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
ABLE TO WORK ON IN THAT ENDURING

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
PRESENCE.

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND THE KEY MISSIONS ARE THE

217
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
FOLLOWING.
ONE IS COUNTERTERRORISM WHICH

218
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
MEANS IT CONTINUE TO CONFRONT AL

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
QAEDA.

220
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
AND THOSE THAT YOU KNOW, HAVE

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
ALWAYS CONTINUED TO PLAN ATTACKS

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ON THE UNITED STATES.

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

224
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THERE IS NO AL QAEDA THREAT HERE

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
IN AFGHANISTAN.

226
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SECONDLY, TO DOT TRAINING AND

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
ASSISTANCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THE AFGHAN ARMY AND THIRDLY, TO

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
PROVIDE SOME OF THE ENABLING

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CAPABILITY FOR THE FORCES THAT
ARE HERE.

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NATURE

232
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OF THE PRESENCE.

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, IF

234
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
PLI

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
MISSION, THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
HAS TO REST WITH THE AFGHAN
ARMY.

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> SO YOU'RE NOT YET SURE ON THE

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
NUMBER?
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU'RE JUST

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WAITING FOR AN OUTSET, YOU'RE
NOT SURE ON THE NUMBER.

241
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> WE ARE WORKING INTENTLY RIGHT

242
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
NOW TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT
THAT WILL BE.

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SAY A LOT HAS TO DO WITH THE

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MISSION.
I WILL QUOTE THE PRESIDENT WITH

246
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
BE TO DEFEAT, DISRUPT AND

247
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DESTROY AL QAEDA.

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> RIGHT.
>> IS THAT MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

249
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
>> THE MISSION OF DEFEATING AND

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
DETERRING AL QAEDA, I THINK, IS

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
WELL ON THE WAY TOWARDS, YOU

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
KNOW, ACHIEVING THE MISSION WITH

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
REGARDS TO AFGHANISTAN.

254
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND THE THREAT THAT WE FACE

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
HERE.
WE CONTINUE TO FACE AL QAEDA

256
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
OBVIOUSLY ELSEWHERE.

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000

258

AND SOMALIA AND ELSEWHERE.

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
BUT WE HAVE HAD REMARKABLE

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SUCCESS GOING AFTER SPECIAL

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OPERATIONS AGAINST AL QAEDA HERE

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT.

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MAIN

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
CHALLENGE HERE IS OBVIOUSLY TO

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SAFE HAVEN

266
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
FOR AL QAEDA IN WHICH TO CONDUCT

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ATTACKS BUT THE KEY IT THAT IS

268
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
AN AFGHANISTAN THAT CAN SECURE

269
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
AND GOVERN ITSELF.

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THOSE TWO ARE INNER LOCKED IN

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000

YOU KNOW, I'M VERY CONFIDENT

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THAT THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WANT TO

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
BE SOVEREIGN.

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT.

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THEY WANT TO BE FREE FROM THE

279
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
TALIBAN.

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE.

282
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AND THAT'S OKAY.

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

284
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HERE.

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
JUST TO HAVE AN AFGHANISTAN THAT

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
CAN DETERMINE.

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Music is a universal language.

369
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But when I was in an accident...

370
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was worried the
health care system

371
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
spoke a language all its own

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

373
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Information on my phone.

374
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

376
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So I never missed a beat.

377
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

378
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
more than 70
million Americans.

379
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's health in numbers.

TONIGHT OUR GUEST,

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
PROFESSOR SARGENT,
CAN YOU TELL ME

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
WHAT CD RATES WILL
BE IN TWO YEARS?

386
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
NO.

387
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
IF HE CAN'T, NO ONE CAN.

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THAT'S WHY ALLY HAS
A RAISE YOUR RATE CD.

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
ALLY BANK.

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
YOUR MONEY NEEDS AN ALLY.

391
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SHE ALSO LIKES
TO RIDE HER BIKE.

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
SHE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAKING OR LOSING MONEY

393
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
CAN POP UP ANYTIME.

394
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THAT'S WHY SHE TRADES WITH
THE LEADER IN MOBILE TRADING.

395
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
SO SHE'S ALWAYS READY
TO TAKE ACTION,

396
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
NO MATTER HOW WILY...

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OR WEIRD...

398
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
OR WONDERFULLY
THE MARKET'S BEHAVING...

399
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

400
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

401
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
[ sniffs ] I TOOK DAYQUIL
BUT MY NOSE IS STILL RUNNY.

403
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS,

404
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
REALLY?
[ Male Announcer ]
Alka-Seltzer Plus

405

FIGHTS YOUR WORST
COLD SYMPTOMS,

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
PLUS IT RELIEVES

[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>>> DESPITE THE ATTACK ON THE

411
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
KANDAHAR BASE A COUPLE HOURS

412
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
AFTER WE WERE THERE WITH THE

413
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
DEFENSE SECRETARY, THE MESSAGE

414
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
FROM THE UNITED STATES IS CLEAR.

415
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
TERRORISTS WILL NOT WIN HERE IN
AFGHANISTAN.

416
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
WHAT IS THE REALITY ON THE

417
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
GROUND?
OUT FRONT TONIGHT TWO MEN WHO

418
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO KNOW.

419
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
MATTHEW ROSE ENBURG WITH THE NEW

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
YORK TIMES BASED IN AFGHANISTAN

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE

423
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
AFGHAN PARLIAMENT.
I WANT IT BRING BOTH OF YOU GUYS

424
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
IN HERE.

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WAKING UP

426
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
IN KABUL.

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I WANT IT ASK YOU ABOUT THIS

428
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ATTACK.

429
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
IT HAPPENED A COUPLE HOURS AFTER

430
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
THE DEFENSE SECRETARY WAS IN

431
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
KANDAHAR.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS

432
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
RELATED TO HIS VISIT OR NOT.

433
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
GENERAL USE END EXAMPLE OF WHERE

434
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
INSURGENCE FAILED IN THE PAST.

435
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THEY FAILED IN KANDAHAR AT THE

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AIR BASE.

437
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
HE SAID THAT TWO HOURS BEFORE

438
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
THIS HAPPENED.

439
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
WHAT'S THE REALITY?

440
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
>> THEY FAILED.

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS THERE.

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
BUT THAT ROAD HAS BEEN BOMBED

443
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
BEFORE.

444
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THE ENVIRONMENT, AROUND THE

445
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
CITY, IT IS SO UNSAFE WE HAVE A

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
REPORTER IN AFGHAN THAT WORKS

447
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
FOR US IN KANDAHAR CITY.

448
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
WON'T DRIVE WHERE THE SURGE IS

449
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
PLAYED OUT.

450
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
IF IT IS NOT SAFE ENOUGH FOR

451
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
HIM, NEVER MIND WESTERNERS.

452
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
WE CAN NEVER GO TO THOSE PLACES.

453
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
IT IS BETTER THAN IT WAS AT THE

454
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
HEIGHT OF THE SURGE.

455
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
IT WAS MORE VIOLENT NAN 2THAN I

456
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WAS UNDER 2008, 2009.

457
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
>> WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER IT THAT,

458
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
WHEN SOMEONE SPENDS A LOT OF

459
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
TIME HERE, WHAT DID WE

460
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ACCOMPLISH.
>> THERE ARE AREAS MUCH SAFER,

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
BUT NOT SAFE ENOUGH YET.

462
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THAT'S THE THING.
WE ARE LEAVING NOW AND IS THIS

463
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
DONE?
IS IT READY TO HAND OVER TO THE

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AFGHANS?

465
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
THE GENERAL SAYS, THE QUESTION
IS SUSTAINABILITY.

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
CAN WE SUSTAIN IT.

467
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
WE WILL FIND OUT NEXT SUMMER AND

468
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I DON'T THINK -- IT IS AN OPEN

469
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
QUESTION.
>> AND YOU JUST HEARD THE

470
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAY WE'VE

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
HAD SUCCESS IN DISRUPTING AL

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
QAEDA.

473
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
HE IS SAYING, WE'RE ON THE PATH.

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
HE IS CAREFUL TO SAY THAT.

475
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THAT THE REALITY WHEN THE U.S.

476
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
LEAVES, HOW BIG IS THE RISK THAT

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THIS PLACE AGAIN BECOMES A

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
SANCTUARY FOR TERRORISM OR

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO PUT ON

480
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
IT?
>> I DON'T BLAME AMERICAN

481
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
OFFICIALS TO PAINT A ROSEY

482
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
PICTURES.
IT IS NOT AS ROSEY AS THEY THINK

483
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
OR AS PESSIMIST AS SOME THING.

484
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I THINK THE SOLUTION IS IN THE

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
ASPECTS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN

486
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
AFTER THE U.S. LEAVES, WHICH IS

487
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT'S

488
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
RESPONSIBILITY AND ALSO THE

489
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TURNING POINT WILL BE THE AFGHAN

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

491
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I THINK THE AFGHAN PEOPLE CAN

492
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AND WILL HELP THE SECURITY

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SITUATION IF THEY ARE CONFIDENT

494
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE THE

495
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
GOVERNMENT TO RELATE TO, THAT

496
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT, AND RULE

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
OF LAW, THE GOVERNANCE THAT HAS

498
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
TO BE PROVIDED.

499
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
ALL THOSE THINGS ARE A BIG

500
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
QUESTION.

501
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT ELECTION
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, BUT THEN

502
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
SECURITY WILL BE DETERIORATING

503
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
BECAUSE PUBLIC SUPPORT WILL NOT

504
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
BE THERE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO

505
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
HELP RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THE

506
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
AFGHAN PEOPLE.
>> AND IT IS INTERESTING.

507
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO,

508
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
MATT, SAYS WE TAKE IT FOR

509
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
GRANTED THAT THERE IS EITHER A

510
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
CIVIL WAR OR REAL RISK OF CIVIL

511
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
WAR WHEN THE U.S. LEAVES.

512
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
WE WENT TO A BIZARRE.

513
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
JUST ASKED AFGHANS WHAT THEY

514
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THOUGHT AND WHETHER THEY THINK

515
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
IT IS GOOD THAT THE UNITED

516
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
STATES IS LEAVING.
SHEER WHAT THEY SAID.

517
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
>>.

518
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
>> Translator: AMERICA SHOULD
LEAVE AFGHANISTAN IMMEDIATELY.

519
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
GO BACK TO AMERICA.

520
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THE MUSLIMS THEMSELVES SHOULD

521
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
LEAD AFTER AFGHANISTAN AND BUILD

522
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
IT WITH THEIR HANDS.

523
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
>> AFTER THEY LEAVE THE AFGHAN

524
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
GOVERNMENT CAN LEAD THE PEACE TO

525
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THE COUNTRY.

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WE DON'T NEED THE AMERICANS.

527
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
>> IS THERE NO NEED FOR AMERICA

528
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
TO STAY?

529
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I KNOW THERE'S NATIONALISM,

530
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THERE'S PRIDE.

531
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
BUT WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

532
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> WE DO NEED TO STAY IF -- TO

533
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
HOLD THIS TOGETHER.

534
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
NOW DOES OUR PRESENCE HERE HELP?

535
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER QUESTION.

536
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THERE'S A STRONG CASE TO BE MADE

537
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THAT WE PROVIDE AN ACCELERANT.

538
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WE PROVIDE A REASON FOR PEOPLE

539
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
TO FIGHT AGAINST US.

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THESE GUYS

541
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ARE SAYING.

542
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THEY SAY LOOK, WE HAVE TO STEP

543
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
UP ON OUR OWN.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

544
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THEN THERE IS READINESS.

545
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
POST 24 TEAM BETWEEN THE

546
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AID IS

547
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000

910
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
MEMORIES, AND ANXIOUSLY AWAIT

911
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
JOSH'S NEXT HOMECOMING.

912
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
>> EVERY DAY WE EAT ONE M&M, AND

913
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THAT REPRESENTS ONE MORE DAY OF
HIM BEING CLOSER TO COMING HOME.

914
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>> SERGEANT BERNDT TOLD ME ABOUT

915
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THOSE M&Ms AND SAID IT IS A

916
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
SPECIAL MOMENT FOR HIM EVERY

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
SINGLE NIGHT.

918
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
HE IS SCHEDULED TO COME HOME IN

919
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
TWO MONTHS, HE WON'T BE HOME FOR

920
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
CHRISTMAS.

921
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HIM

922
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
AT THE BASE IN KANDAHAR, WHERE

923
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON

924
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
HIS JOB AND THE FUTURE FOR

925
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
AFGHANISTAN.
YOU GO OUT IN THIS EVERY DAY?

926
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
>> YES, MA'AM.

927
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THIS IS AN M-WRAP.

928
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
IT'S A VEHICLE THAT WE USE, IT

929
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
CARRIES ROUGHLY FIVE PERSONNEL.

930
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOU HAVE THE DRIVER, THE TANK

931
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
COMMANDER, WHICH IS A PASSENGER,

932
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
AND THE TWO DISMOUNTS IN THE

933
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
BACK AND THE FIFTH PERSON WILL

934
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
BE, OF COURSE, THE GUNNER, WHO

935
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
IS UP TOP.

936
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
>> AND WHERE DO YOU SIT?

937
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>> I SIT ON THE T-SEAT, THE TANK

938
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
COMMANDER, WHICH IS IN CONTROL,

939
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
BASICALLY, OF THE VEHICLE.

940
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
AND AS WE GO OUT, YOU KNOW, I'M

941
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
IN CHARGE OF CONTROLLING THIS

942
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
VEHICLE, WHERE WE'RE GOING, WHAT

943
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THE GUNNER DOES, IF I NEED TO

944
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
REACT TO CERTAIN THINGS, AND I'M

945
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
BASICALLY THE PASSENGER, THE TC

946
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
OR SHOTGUN SEAT, IF YOU WANT TO
SAY.

947
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
>> SO DO YOU EVER -- I GUESS
I -- DO YOU EVER GET SCARED?

948
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> I GUESS IT'S ONLY HUMAN

949
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
NATURE TO GET SCARED, IN SOME

950
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

951
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
BUT YOU DO IT SO MANY TIMES, YOU

952
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
GET USED TO IT IN, IN A WAY.

953
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
AND I'VE BEEN TRAINING WITH

954
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THESE PEOPLE SO LONG, WE ALMOST

955
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

956
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
BEFORE WE DO IT.
AND IT IS SECOND NATURE FOR US

957
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
AND IT'S PRETTY EASY AT TIMES.

958
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
>> AND YOU SAY IT'S SECOND

959
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
NATURE, AND YOU KNOW THESE
PEOPLE BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE

960
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
WORLD.

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
IS THIS SORT OF LIKE A SECOND

962
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
FAMILY TO YOU, IN ANY WAY?

963
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY MY SECOND

964
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
FAMILY.

965
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
EVEN AS I CAME INTO THE

966
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
MILITARY, MY WIFE, IN GENERAL,

967
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A BIG PART

968
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
OF OUR FAMILY.

969
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
AND MY WIFE HAS ACCEPTED

970
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
EVERYONE THAT I'VE TRAINED OR

971
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
BEEN LEADERS OF AND IT IS

972
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
DEFINITELY A SECOND FAMILY FOR

973
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ME, DEFINITELY.

974
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
>> AND THIS HAS BEEN YOUR CAREER

975
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
FROM THE BEGINNING?

976
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> THIS HAS BEEN MY CAREER FROM
THE BEGINNING.

977
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'VE BEEN IN 12 YEARS.

978
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY, WHATEVER

979
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I DO, I EXCEL AT, AND I TRY TO

980
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT, AND

981
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT I'VE

982
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
DONE MY WHOLE CAREER.

983
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
>> YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AT

984
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
HOME, THEY WONDER, DID AMERICA

985
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
REALLY GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS

986
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
WAR?

987
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WHAT HAVE WE ACCOMPLISHED?

988
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
AND YOU'RE HERE EVER DAY, YOU'RE
FIGHTING, YOU'RE PATROLLING HERE

989
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
IN KANDAHAR.

990
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN OUT OF THIS?

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> WE'VE GOTTEN QUITE A BIT.

992
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I MEAN, HONESTLY, THE AFGHAN

993
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
PEOPLE, EVEN FROM WHAT I WAS

994
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
DEPLOYED IN IRAQ IN '03, DURING

995
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THE INVASION, YOU COULD SEE THE

996
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
IRAQ PEOPLE AND THE AFGHAN

997
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
PEOPLE STARTING TO DO STUFF ON

998
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THEIR OWN.

999
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
HAVING MORE FREEDOM AND STUFF
LIKE THAT.

1000
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
AND THAT IS A BIG THING THAT I

1001
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
TAKE OUT OF THIS.

1002
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
IS THEM BEING ABLE TO DO STUFF

1003
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
ON THEIR OWN, WITHOUT HAVING

1004
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, TELLING THEM

1005
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

1006
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

1007
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
AND I THINK THAT'S FREEDOM AND

1008
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
STUFF LIKE THAT IS A BIG

1009
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME, BEING

1010
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HERE, THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME,

1011
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AND SEEING THE GAINS THAT WE

1012
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

1013
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
>> AND DO YOU THINK, FROM WHERE

1014
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
YOU SIT, THAT AFGHANISTAN IS

1015
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
GOING TO BE READY, FOR PEOPLE
LIKE YOU TO GO HOME?

1016
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
>> YES, I DEFINITELY DO.

1017
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'M GOING ON PATROL WITH THE

1018
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PARTNERS.

1019
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
>> YOU GO OUT WITH THEM, BECAUSE
YOU'RE TRAINING THEM --?

1020
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> EXACTLY.

1021
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
AND THEY DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN

1022
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THAT YEARS AGO THEY WERE NOT
DOING ON THEIR OWN.

1023
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
THE LOGISTICS PART OF IT AND ALL

1024
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THAT STUFF.
THEY ARE SUSTAINABLE BY

1025
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THEMSELVES.

1026
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> WE HEAR A LOT, THOUGH, ABOUT

1027
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
AFGHANS WHO WORK WITH AMERICANS

1028
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
AND THEN THEY WILL BLOW
THEMSELVES UP AND KILL

1029
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
AMERICANS.

1030
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
DO YOU HAVE A FEAR THAT THAT
COULD HAPPEN?

1031
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
>> IT WOULD BE ALMOST UNHUMAN TO

1032
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THINK THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR

1033
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
MIND, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET WHAT

1034
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
WE CALL COMPLACENT, BUT WE'VE

1035
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
BUILT SUCH A TRUST WITH THESE

1036
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
GUYS THAT THE IN AND OUT DAYS OF

1037
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WORKING WITH THEM, THAT STUFF
JUST GOES TO THE WAYSIDE,

1038
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM

1039
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AS ONE OF YOUR BROTHERS, WORKING

1040
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WITH THEM, AND ONE OF YOUR OWN

1041
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
SOLDIERS, ALSO.

1042
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
>> AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT?

1043
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> TOTALLY FINE, YES.

1044
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
>> SERGEANT, WHAT MAKES YOU THE

1045
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
MOST PROUD ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE

1046
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
DONE HERE?

1047
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
>> I THINK THE MOST PROUD IS

1048
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
JUST SEEING THE KIDS, AND THAT

1049
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
GENERATION THAT ARE GOING TO

1050
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE HERE IN

1051
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
AFGHANISTAN.

1052
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
THE ELDERS AND STUFF ARE STILL

1053
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
IN THAT MIND-SET, BUT THE

1054
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
YOUNGER GENERATIONS, WHAT --

1055
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK

1056
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
FORWARD TO AS THE YEARS PROGRESS

1057
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
IN THIS COUNTRY, IN AFGHANISTAN,

1058
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
IS THAT THE SUCCESSES THEY CAN

1059
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
MAKE, THEY CAN GO OUT AND BE

1060
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SOMEONE, RATHER THAN BEING

1061
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
SECLUDED IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS,

1062
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THEY CAN MAKE LIVES FOR
THEMSELVES, OUTSIDE OF HERE.

1063
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
>> AND WOULD YOU GO TO ANOTHER

1064
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WAR, IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAR?

1065
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THE WAR ON TERROR CONTINUES.

1066
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE, WOULD YOU

1067
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
STILL GO?
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, YES.

1068
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP TO DO
FOR MY COUNTRY.

1069
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY I

1070
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
JOINED THE MILITARY, FOR MY

1071
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
COUNTRY AND FOR MY FAMILY, TO
SUPPORT MY FAMILY, AND THOSE ARE

1072
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
TWO THINGS I LOVE THE MOST, SO I

1073
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WOULD DEFINITELY.

1074
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
>> THE TWO THINGS THAT HE LOVES

1075
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THE MOST.

1076
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT HIS

1077
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
FAMILY, HE WAS EMOTIONAL.

1078
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAD PREPARED A

1079
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR HIM, THAT WE

1080
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WERE ABLE TO PLAY FOR SERGEANT

1081
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
BERNDT.

1082
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
AND WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT

1083
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
HAPPENED.

1084
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> HI, HONEY.

1085
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WE LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU.

1086
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

1087
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
WE HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A MERRY
CHRISTMAS AND THAT YOU COME HOME

1088
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SOON.

1089
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> HI, DADDY.

1090
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I LOVE AND MISS YOU AND HAVE A

1091
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1092
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> MERRY CHRISTMAS!

1093
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
LOVE YOU.

1094
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
BYE!

1095
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> GOOD.
>> THEY MISS YOU.

1096
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
>> I MISS THEM TOO.

1097
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOUR WIFE WAS

1098
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
REALLY STRONG.
>> YEAH.
>> SHE --

1099
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
>> WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART ABOUT

1100
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
NOT BEING WITH HER?

1101
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> I MEAN, JUST BEING THERE

1102
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
EVERY DAY, SEEING, YOU KNOW,

1103
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THEIR DAILY ROUTINE AND WHAT

1104
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THEY DO AND, YOU KNOW, JUST

1105
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
GOING THROUGH, KIDS COMING HOME

1106
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
FROM SCHOOL, DOING HOMEWORK, YOU

1107
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
KNOW, MY SON PLAYING SPORTS AND

1108
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
STUFF LIKE THAT, AND THINGS MY

1109
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
DAUGHTER DOES, AND SHE'S JUST

1110
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
SO, YOU KNOW, OUTGOING AND DOES

1111
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THINGS ON HER OWN NOW THAT I

1112
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
DON'T SEE.
THE BIRTHDAYS, OF COURSE, AND

1113
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
EVEN THE SMALL THINGS LIKE

1114
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
MOTHER'S DAY AND FATHER'S DAY.

1115
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
JUST THINGS BEING AWAY FROM THE

1116
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
FAMILY.

1117
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
BUT WE TRY TO DO THE BEST, YOU

1118
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
KNOW.

1119
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
BUT WHILE I'M DEPLOYED, YOU

1120
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
KNOW, SHE KEEPS ME SO IN THE

1121
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
LOOP AND WE TRY TO DO THINGS

1122
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
TOGETHER STILL AS A FAMILY,

1123
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
EVEN THOUGH I'M FAR WAY WAY.

1124
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
BEING THERE FOR THE KIDS,

1125
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THEM

1126
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
AND THAT STUFF WHILE THEY'RE

1127
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OPENING THEIR PRESENTS AND

1128
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
STUFF, EVEN THOUGH I'M SO FAR

1129
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
AWAY IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, WE

1130
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DEEP THAT BOND TOGETHER UNTIL I

1131
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
COME HOME.

1132
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
>> YOUR SON, I SAW SOMETHING HE

1133
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
DID AT SCHOOL, WHERE HE WROTE

1134
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
ABOUT HOW PROUD HE IS OF YOU,

1135
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEPLOYED AND

1136
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
YOU'RE SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES.

1137
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>> YEAH, HE CAN BECOME A

1138
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
STICKLER AND HARDHEADED, BUT I

1139
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THINK THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE, HE

1140
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ENJOYS AND FEELS SO APPRECIATIVE

1141
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
FOR WHAT I DO, AND ESPECIALLY MY

1142
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
DAUGHTER, HALLEY, TOO.

1143
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WHAT I'M

1144
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DOING AND THEY KNOW THAT I'M
SAFE.

1145
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
SO THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

1146
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
>> AND YOU SAID, THE ONE THING

1147
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
SHE TOLD YOU IS THAT HE WAS

1148
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WEARING HIS PACKERS SHIRT.

1149
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
>> YEAH, YEAH.

1150
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I EMBEDDED IT IN

1151
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
HIS HEAD WHEN HE WAS SUCH A

1152
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
YOUNG KID, ABOUT BEING A PACKERS

1153
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
FAN, BUT AS SOON AS HE KNEW HE

1154
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WAS GOING TO BE ON TV, HE HAD TO

1155
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
WEAR HIS PACKERS JERSEY.

1156
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> YOU WERE TELLING ME A STORY

1157
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
ABOUT THE PACKERS WERE PLAYING,

1158
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
BUT YOU WEREN'T HOME.

1159
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> YEAH, EVERY SUNDAY OR SO,

1160
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'LL CALL AND ASK HIM, AND I'LL

1161
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
BE LIKE, JOSH, DO YOU KNOW WHO

1162
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
THE PACKERS ARE PLAYING THIS
WEEK?

1163
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AND HE KNOWS TO A T WHO THEY'RE
PLAYING.

1164
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
AND I'LL ASK HIM IF THEY'RE

1165
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
GOING TO WIN OR IF THEY'RE GOING

1166
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
TO LOSE.

1167
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
AND HE ALWAYS VOTES AGAINST THE
PACKERS FOR SOME REASON.

1168
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
AND I ASKED HIM, JOSH, WHY DO

1169
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
YOU ALWAYS VOTE AGAINST THE

1170
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
PACKERS, AND HE SAID, BECAUSE

1171
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
YOU'RE NOT HERE, DAD.

1172
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AND I GET THAT.

1173
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
A 5-YEAR-OLD SON --

1174
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> HE MISSES YOU.

1175
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HE JUST WANTS YOU THERE.

1176
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
>> DEFINITELY.

1177
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
>>> NEXT, MY INTERVIEW FALLY

1178
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
AKUFY.

1179
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
THE TALIBAN HAVE REPEATEDLY

1180
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
THREATENED TO KILL HER.
THEY TRIED TO KILL HER AND HER

1181
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
TWO LITTLE GIRLS, BUT SHE'S

1182
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
STILL GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT

1183
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
OF AFGHANISTAN IN 2014.

1184
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
HER VIEW OF WHERE THE COUNTRY IS

1185
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
HEADED AND AN INSPIRATIONAL

1186
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
MEETING WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS.

1187
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
IS NEXT.
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS BOB,

1188
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
A REGULAR GUY
WITH AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.

1189
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
THE USUAL, BOB?

1190
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
NOT TODAY.

1191
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BOB HAS AFIB:

1192
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1193
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
A CONDITION THAT PUTS HIM
AT GREATER RISK FOR A STROKE.

1194
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
[ GPS ] TURN LEFT.

1195
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

1196
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
[ Male Announcer ]
FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

1197
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

1198
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

1199
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
BOB'S DOCTOR RECOMMENDED
A DIFFERENT OPTION:

1200
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

1201
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
XARELTO® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

1202
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ONCE-A-DAY PRESCRIPTION
BLOOD THINNER

1203
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
FOR PATIENTS WITH AFIB

1204
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1205
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

1206
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

1207
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

1208
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

1209
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
WHEN WARFARIN IS WELL MANAGED.

1210
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

1211
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
MEANS BOB CAN SPEND HIS
EXTRA TIME HOWEVER HE LIKES.

1212
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
NEW ZEALAND!

1213
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
XARELTO®
IS JUST ONE PILL A DAY,

1214
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
TAKEN WITH THE EVENING MEAL.

1215
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
AND WITH
NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

1216
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
BOB CAN EAT THE HEALTHY FOODS
HE LIKES.

1217
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

1218
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

1219
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

1220
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1221
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

1222
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

1223
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

1224
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

1225
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

1226
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

1227
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

1228
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

1229
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

1230
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

1231
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

1232
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

1233
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

1234
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

1235
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

1236
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
OR BLEEDING PROBLEMS.

1237
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
READY TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE?

1238
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000

1250
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000

1251

TWO DAUGHTERS.

1252
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000

1253
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000

SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT HOME.

1261
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000

1262
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
EVEN FELT SAFE THERE.

1263
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
>> LIVING IN AFGHANISTAN, YOU

1264
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE SAFE.

1265
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE ATTACKED IN

1266
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
YOUR HOME.

1267
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

1268
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
TO THE POLITICIANS BEFORE.
THEY WERE EVEN ATTACKED IN THEIR

1269
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
MEETING ROOMS AND THEY WERE

1270
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
KILLED.

1271
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
>> IN THE ROOM THAT WE'RE

1272
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
SITTING RIGHT NOW IS WHERE, IS

1273
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
PART OF THE WAY AFGHANISTAN

1274
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
GOVERNS DIFFERENTLY, MAYBE THAN

1275
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THE UNITED STATES.

1276
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
PEOPLE COME FROM YOUR PROVINCE,

1277
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
THEY COME AND THEY ASK YOU FOR
THINGS.

1278
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
>> YES.
>>

1279
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
AND EVEN LAST WEEK, YOU SAID YOU

1280
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
HAD A SCARE, SOMEONE THAT WAS

1281
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
COMING AND ASKING YOU FOR HELP,

1282
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
BUT YOU THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE

1283
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
WEARING A SUICIDE VEST.

1284
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
>> SOMETIMES PEOPLE COME WITH

1285
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
VERY UNUSUAL AND EXCEPTIONAL

1286
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
SITUATION AND THEY WANT TO PROVE

1287
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
THAT THEY NEED REALLY OUR HELP.

1288
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
SO FOR INSTANCE, LAST WEEK, THIS

1289
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
MAN CAME WHO WAS A PATIENT, WHO

1290
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
WAS A SICK PERSON.

1291
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
HE NEEDED TO CHANGE HIS KIDNEYS

1292
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
AND THE CURRENT KIDNEY DOESN'T

1293
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
WORK, SO HE WANTED ME TO HELP

1294
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
HIM TO GET TO THE MINISTER OF

1295
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
HEALTH.

1296
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
AND AS HE ENTERED, HE LOOKED SO

1297
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
UNUSUAL THAT THE ROOM WAS FULL

1298
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
OF PEOPLE, AND I HAD TO GO -- I

1299
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
HAD TO RUN ALMOST TO THE OTHER

1300
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
SIDE OF THE ROOM, THINKING THAT

1301
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
HE'S FULL OF WIRE AND ALL OF

1302
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THOSE EXPLOSIVES.

1303
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT HE IS A

1304
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
SICK PERSON, ASKING FOR MY HELP.

1305
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THAT'S AN INDICATION OF HOW

1306
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN HAVE

1307
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
PROBLEMS AND HOW MUCH, BY DOING

1308
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SMALL THINGS FOR THEM, THEY

1309
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
BECOME HAPPY AND THAT'S OUR JOB

1310
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
TO DO SMALL THINGS.

1311
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> AS A WOMAN, DO YOU THINK A

1312
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
LOT OF THE, SOME OF THE

1313
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
ACHIEVEMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED,

1314
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
GIRLS GOING TO SCHOOL AND MORE

1315
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
WOMEN WORKING, WOMEN LIKE YOU,

1316
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
BEING ABLE TO BE IN PARLIAMENT

1317
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
NOW, YOU'VE GOT MORE WOMEN IN

1318
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
PARLIAMENT, 27% OR 22, IT'S ONLY

1319
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
18% IN THE U.S., SO IT'S BEEN
REAL PROGRESS.

1320
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
DO YOU THINK A LOT OF THAT IS

1321
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
GOING TO BE ROLLED BACK OR GO

1322
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
AWAY WHEN THE U.S. LEAVES, OR DO

1323
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
YOU THINK AFGHANISTAN WILL KEEP

1324
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THAT?

1325
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
>> WE ARE WORRIED THAT PERHAPS

1326
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
IN MANY PLACES, TALIBAN CLOSED

1327
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS, ESPECIALLY IN

1328
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
THE SOUTH, AND RECENTLY, YOU ARE

1329
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
AWARE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS,

1330
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AND

1331
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
NORTHEAST, BEING POISONED BY
TALIBAN.

1332
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
SO WE KNOW THEIR INTENTION.

1333
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AND WE ARE WORRIED THAT ONCE THE

1334
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LEAVES,

1335
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE

1336
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
COME AFTER, AS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF

1337
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
THE 2001, WOULD BE UNDERMINED BY

1338
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
SECURITY AND BY THE SYMPATHY TO

1339
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
BRING TALIBAN BACK TO POWERS.

1340
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
>> AND ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR

1341
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
PRESIDENT?

1342
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I KNOW PEOPLE SAY, LOOK, IT'S A

1343
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
LONG SHOT.

1344
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE,

1345
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT

1346
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
ANYWAY AND GO OUT WITH THE
PUBLIC SPEECHES?

1347
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY RISK TO THAT,

1348
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
BUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE
DETERMINED TO DO?

1349
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
>> I DON'T WANT BUY THIS

1350
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
ARGUMENT, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THERE

1351
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
IS NO CHANCE.

1352
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
IT'S JUST THE MIND-SET, IF A

1353
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
WOMAN HAS A CHANCE IN OTHER

1354
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES OF

1355
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
AFGHANISTAN, WHY NOT IN

1356
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
AFGHANISTAN?

1357
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
AFGHANISTAN HAS A LONG HISTORY
OF CIVILIZATION.

1358
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
>> AS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT,

1359
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
YOU'RE PART OF A GOVERNMENT THAT

1360
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
IS RANKED 179 IN CORRUPTION IN

1361
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THE WORLD, OUT OF 180.

1362
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THAT'S A PRETTY TERRIBLE RATING.

1363
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
AND I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE, YOU

1364
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
SIT HERE AS SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING

1365
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE, BUT DOES

1366
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
THIS MEAN THAT EVEN YOU, WHO HAS

1367
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
BEEN A HERO FOR WOMEN AND

1368
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
INSPIRATION, A FIGHTER, THE

1369
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
WORLD, THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WOULD

1370
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
THEY DEFINE YOU AS CORRUPT,

1371
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
EVERY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

1372
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
CORRUPT, GIVEN THESE OVERALL

1373
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
NUMBERS THAT WE SEE?
ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING?

1374
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
>> I THINK, YES.

1375
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WELL, 20% OF THE FANS WHO ARE

1376
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
COMING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF

1377
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
AFGHANISTAN, 80% ARE BEING SPENT

1378
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS.

1379
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
SO NOT ONLY IN THE BROADER

1380
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
PICTURE AS THE GOVERNMENT OF

1381
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
AFGHANISTAN, ALTHOUGH I AM NOT

1382
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
IN POWER, IN A WAY THAT I AM NOT

1383
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
IN POSITION, WE ARE THE CRITICS

1384
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE

1385
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
REFORMISTS, WE WOULD LIKE TO

1386
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
BRING CHANGES.

1387
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I AGREE IN A WAY THAT THERE IS

1388
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
CORRUPTION.

1389
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
NOT ONLY MONEY CORRUPTION, BUT

1390
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
ALSO POLITICAL CORRUPTION,

1391
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION.

1392
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
ALL OF THAT IS THERE.

1393
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
>> FAWZIA HAS TWO YOUNG

1394
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
DAUGHTERS.

1395
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL, SMART,

1396
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
INSPIRING GIRLS AND I WAS CURE

1397
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
ABOUT HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THEM

1398
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
STAYING HERE IN AFGHANISTAN.

1399
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
IF THE TALIBAN COMES BACK.

1400
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
SO, FAWZIA, YOU WANT YOUR

1401
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
DAUGHTERS TO STAY AFTER U.S.

1402
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
LEAVES.

1403
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
STAY IN AFGHANISTAN.
>> THEY WILL STAY HERE.

1404
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
BUT IF THINGS, GOD FOR BID, IF

1405
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
THINGS GO REALLY BAD, I THINK

1406
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
THAT WE WILL HAVE NO OPTION.

1407
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1408
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE

1409
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
U.S. LEAVES?

1410
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
>> Translator: THIS IS OUR

1411
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
COUNTRY AND WE CANNOT LET OUR

1412
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
COUNTRY GET DOWN.
WHATEVER HAPPY NEED TO STAY IN

1413
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
MY COUNTRY.

1414
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
>> AND WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE

1415
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

1416
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
>> Translator: A PRESIDENT.

1417
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
>> YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT?

1418
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> YEAH.

1419
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
>> PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN?

1420
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
>> YEAH.

1421
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
>> WHAT ABOUT YOU?
>> I WANT TO BE A SPACE

1422
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ENGINEER.

1423
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
>> SPACE ENGINEER.

1424
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
>> YES.

1425
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
>> SO PEOPLE WHO SAY, GIRLS IN

1426
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
AFGHANISTAN ARE GOING TO HAVE

1427
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
BIG PROBLEMS, MAYBE THEY DON'T

1428
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

1429
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
>> YES, MAYBE.

1430
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
>> AND WHAT ABOUT -- WHAT ARE

1431
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
YOUR WORRIES ABOUT SCHOOL?

1432
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO

1433
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
BE THE SAME NEXT YEAR WHEN THE

1434
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
U.S. LEAVES, THAT YOU WILL BE

1435
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
ABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL?

1436
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
ARE YOU WORRIED THERE COULD BE

1437
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
CHANGES THAT HAPPEN FAST?

1438
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
>> I THINK THERE COULD BE

1439
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
CHANGES.
