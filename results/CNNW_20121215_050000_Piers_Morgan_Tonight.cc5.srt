PEOPLE HOLDING CANDLES BUT THE

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
CALL WAS FOR MORE GUN CONTROL.

TOUGHER LEGISLATION.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A VISIBLY SHAKEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OFFERED THESE WORDS ABOUT THE

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
MASS KILLING.

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
AHEAD OF THEM.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
TEACHERS.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEIR

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
LIVES TO HELPING OUR CHILDREN

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NATION WOULD HAVE BEEN FEELING

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AND TONIGHT POLICE HAVE

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
IDENTIFIED THE KILLER AS ADAM

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
LANZA.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
THIS IS HIS BROTHER RYAN LANZA

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
BEING TAKEN INTO QUESTIONING.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
MUCH MORE ON THE SHOOTER AHEAD.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I SPOKE WITH THE FORMER

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
CLASSMATE.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS NEW DETAILS

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
FROM OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A DESPERATE DAY FOR THE SCHOOL

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
AND THE FAMILIES OF THE POOR

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CHILDREN AND FOR AMERICA.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE PERSON

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WHO PERPETRATED THE HIDEOUS
CRIME?

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> IT IS SO HEART BREAKING.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
WE ARE LEARNING HE IS

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WE KNOW, ACCORDING TO OUR

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SOURCES, THAT FOR WHATEVER

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
REASON WHEN HE CAME TO THE

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
SCHOOL THIS DAY, HE WAS WEARING

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WHAT IS DESCRIBED TO ME AS BLACK

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BATTLE FATIGUES AND A MILITARY

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
VEST.
HE CAME ARMED WITH THREE

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WEAPONS.
TWO OF THEM HAND GUNS.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
ONE AS A GLOCK AND ANOTHER AS A

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SIG SAUER AND A THIRD POLICE

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
FOUND IN THE VEHICLE.

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THE TWO WEAPONS WERE FOUND ON

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
HIM IN THE SCHOOL.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE THIRD WAS FOUND, THE BUSH

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
MASTER WHICH IS A SEMI AUTOMATIC

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
WAS FOUND IN A CAR OUTSIDE THE

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
SCHOOL.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHAT LED HIM TO THIS?

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
WE DO KNOW THIS.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
POLICE HAVE QUESTIONED BOTH HIS

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
BROTHER AND HIS FATHER.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
HIS BROTHER WAS TAKEN INTO

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
CUSTODY FOR QUESTIONING ONLY.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
HE IS NOT BEING CALLED A
SUSPECT.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
FROM HIS APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN,

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
NEW JERSEY.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WE UNDERSTAND THE FATHER WAS

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
ALSO QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
HERE IN THE NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AREA.

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE FATHER IS DIVORCED FROM

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
NANCY LANZA.

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
SHE IS THE MOTHER OF THE TWO WHO

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
IS A SCHOOL TEACHER AND COUNTED

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
AMONG THE DEAD.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
HER BODY WAS FOUND IN A

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
RESIDENCE HERE IN THE NEWTOWN

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AREA, AS WELL.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, PIERS, THE

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WEAPONS ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
WERE OWNED BY THE MOTHER, NANCY

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
LANZA IN THIS CASE.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
NOT BY THE SHOOTER.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
STILL TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER A

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
MOTIVE.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THERE SIGNS WE ARE HEARING FOR

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OUR SOURCES THAT THE SHOOTER MAY

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HAVE SUFFERED FROM SOME KIND OF

126
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
DID HE LEAVE NOTES BEHIND?

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
DID HE TELL ANYONE WHAT HE WAS

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
PLANNING TO DO?

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
ALL HAVE TONIGHT.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I WANT TO TURN TO ASHLEIGH

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
BANFIELD.

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
SHE'S IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AS WELL.
I WAS WATCHING WHEN YOU WERE

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SPEAKING TO WOLF BLITZER AND YOU

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
BECAME VERY EMOTIONAL.

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TWO OF YOUR CHILDREN WENT TO

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT AND YOU

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WERE NOT SURE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WITH THEM.

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THANKFULLY, THEY WERE OKAY.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
BUT THIS IS EVERY PARENT'S
NIGHTMARE.

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
BODIES OF STILL LYING THERE ON

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WHAT THE POLICE ARE CALLING THE

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
CRIME SCENE OF THE SCHOOL.
THE PARENTS CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM.

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
IT'S AN UNIMAGINABLE HORROR.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
>> THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
IT.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
UNIMAGINABLE HORROR AND AN EVIL

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
VISITED UPON THE COMMUNITY

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR OF

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
CONNECTICUT WHO SPOKE HERE

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
EARLIER.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ANOTHER DETAIL FOR YOU THAT I

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WANT TO SHARE ABOUT HOW SOME OF

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THESE PARENTS LEARNED THEY
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THEIR

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW THE

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
DETAIL THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN

163
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
WERE RUSHED OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OUT OF THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BY THE POLICE AND TEACHERS AND

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
RACED ON FOOT TO A NEARBY FIRE

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
STATION WHICH BECAME THE STAGING

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AREA.

169
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THEY WERE ROBO CALLS THAT WENT

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OUT.

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WE HEARD THE ROBOCALLS SAYING

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
PARENTS OF THE SANDY HOOK

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
STUDENTS, COME TO THIS FIRE

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
STATION TO BE REUNITED WITH YOUR

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
CHILDREN.

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THERE WAS ONE

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AREA WITHIN THAT FIRE STATION

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE KEPT AND

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THEY WERE SHOWN MOVIES UNTIL

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THEIR PARENTS COULD COME AND

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
FIND THEM.

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER AREA WHERE A

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
NUMBER OF THE PARENTS WERE

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MILLING ABOUT, WAITING FOR

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
STUDENTS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE

186
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
FIRE STATION.

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS A CHAOTIC
SCENE FOR SOMETIME.

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
SLOWLY BUT SURELY OVER THE

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
COURSE OF THE DAY PARENTS ARRIVE

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
AND CHILDREN WERE TAKEN AWAY AND

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
PARENTS CONTINUED TO WAIT AND

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OTHER CHILDREN DIDN'T ARRIVE AND

193
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ULTIMATELY THERE WAS A MOMENT

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
WHERE THEY HAD TO TELL THE

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WAITING PARENTS THERE WILL BE NO

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
MORE REUNIONS TONIGHT.

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'M TOLD FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
INSIDE THAT AREA IN A ROOM

199
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
ADJACENT THAT AT THE MOMENT THE

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PARENTS WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
NO MORE CHILDREN COMING THERE

202
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WERE WAILS THAT WERE RELEASED.

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE PERSON WHO TOLD ME THIS SHE

204
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SAID SHE COMPLETELY BROKE DOWN.

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THERE WAS A NURSE ON HAND WHO

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
VOLUNTEERED HAVING WORKED TWO

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
DECADES IN THE BUSINESS.

208
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
HER BROTHER TELLING ME THAT SHE

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
JUST WANTED TO BE THERE AND HELP

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IN ANY WAY SHE COULD AS A GRIEF

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
COUNSELLOR AND WAS PRESENT AT

212
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THAT TIME AS WELL.

213
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A HORRIFYING MOMENT IF YOU CAN

214
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IMAGINE BEING THOSE PARENT WHO

215
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IS WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ONLY TO HEAR THIS AND ULTIMATELY

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
LIKE YOU SAID, THEY KNOW THE

218
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BODIES OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
STILL IN THAT SCHOOL TONIGHT.

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WORSE IN THE WORLD.

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THANK YOU FOR NOW.

223
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I WILL BE JOINED BY THE MAYOR OF

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
DANBURY RIGHT NEXT TO NEWTOWN.

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THIS IS ALMOST BEYOND

227
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
DESCRIPTION, BEYOND ANY

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
UNDERSTANDING.

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HOW IS THE COMMUNITY DEALING

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WITH THIS OR ARE THEY?

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

232
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN A

233
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HORRIFIC DAY IN THE GREATER

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
DANBURY AREA AND PARTICULARLY

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN.

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OUR HEART GOES OUT TO THE

237
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST LOVED ONES

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN

239
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
AND THE STAFF AND EVERYBODY

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
ELSE.

241
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT DAY.

242
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THEY HAVE

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
BEEN WORKING HARD AND CAN'T BE

244
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WITH US RIGHT NOW BUT IS DOING

245
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WERE

247
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
TREMENDOUS AND THE STAFF HAVE
BEEN HEROIC IN TERMS OF THEIR

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
APPROACH TO THIS.

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE INTERNATIONAL

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
TRAGEDY AND CRISIS.

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNEW

252
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL WHO

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
ALSO WAS KILLED.

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

255
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING IN

256
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THE SAME SCHOOL SYSTEM AND VERY

257
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DAWN WHO

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
PASSED AWAY TODAY.

259
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SHE WAS A TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SYSTEM AND ELEVATED UP THROUGH

261
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THE RANKS AND ENDED UP THE

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
PRINCIPAL HERE IN NEWTOWN.

263
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A COMMITTED, HARDWORKING AND

264
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
DEDICATED EDUCATOR.

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
SOMEONE WHO CARED DEEPLY ABOUT

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE KIDS AND PUT KIDS FIRST IN

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
EVERY FACET AND EVERY WAY IN
WHICH SHE EXECUTED HER JOB AND

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SOMEBODY WHO WE ALL ADMIRED

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WORKING WITH HER CHILDREN AS A

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
PROFESSIONAL.

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> EXTREMELY SAD DAY AND I

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
APPRECIATE YOU JOINING ME.

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I CAN ONLY WISH YOU THE VERY
BEST.

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WE ARE TRYING TO REBUILD THE
COMMUNITY.

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
DID YOU KNOW IF THERE PLANS FOR

276
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
MORE VIGILS TOMORROW?

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> THERE ARE VIGILS SCHEDULED

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.

279
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
IN ADDITION THAT, CONNECTICUT

280
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ITSELF IS HAVING A SIMULTANEOUS

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
VIGIL THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ORGANIZE RIGHT NOW WHERE EACH

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
TOWN AND VILLAGE AND CITY WILL

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
TAKE A MOMENT OUT AND SPEND TIME

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
REFLECTING AND MAYBE STARTING

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS INITIAL

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HORRENDOUS SHOCK AND REFLECTING

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR PUBLIC

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
POLICY POSITIONS AS THEY RELATE

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TO THINGS LIKE GUN CONTROL AND

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HOW WE DEAL WITH FOLKS THAT ARE

292
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
MENTALLY DISABLED.

293
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THIS HORRIFIC

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED.

295
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THAT CONVERSATION WILL BE
STARTED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
WEEKS.

297
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

298
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FOR JOINING ME.

299
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> THANK YOU, PIERS.

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> WE CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS

301
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
LIKE IN THE SCHOOL.

302
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
SOFIA LOBINSKI WAS THERE AND

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
JUST 8 YEARS OLD.
SHE JOINS ME WITH HER BROTHER,

304
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
BRENDA, THANK YOU BOTH FOR

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
JOINING ME.

306
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IF I MAY START WITH YOU, BRENDA.

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THIS IS EVERY MOTHER'S
NIGHTMARE.

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WHEN WAS THE FIRST YOU HEARD
ABOUT THIS AND HOW DID YOU HEAR?

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM THE

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SUPERINTENDENT SAYING THAT THERE

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WAS A SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN, BUT
DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A SCHOOL.

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE ON

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
LOCKDOWN.

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I WASN'T TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE I

316
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT HAPPENED.

317
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I RECEIVED A TEXT ON MY PHONE

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
FROM A NEWS ORGANIZATION AND

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THEY SAID THAT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HAD A SHOOTING.

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I GOT IN MY CAR AND I WENT OVER

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TO THE SCHOOL AND THERE WERE

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
ALREADY STATE POLICE AND THE

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
FIRE AND NEWTOWN POLICE.

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> WHEN YOU GOT THERE, OBVIOUSLY

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SCENES OF COMPLETE CHAOS, HOW

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
QUICKLY WAS IT THAT YOU REALIZED

328
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAFE?

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> OKAY.

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
COMPLETE CHAOS, BUT I DID SEE

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
MOMS AND A NEIGHBOR AND ASKED

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID

334
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND I

336
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
SAW A NEIGHBOR LIKE I SAID AND

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
HE SAID THEY CARRIED OUT A

338
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
LITTLE GIRL AND SHE LOOKED LIKE

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
SHE WAS DEAD.

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
INSTANTLY I PANICKED BECAUSE OF

341
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
MY BABY HERE, BUT THANKFULLY NO

342
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
SOONER HE SAID THAT I LOOKED

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TOWARDS THE KIDS BEING BROUGHT

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE FIREHOUSE

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
AND I SAW HER CLASS AND I RAN UP

346
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
AND I SAID WHERE IS SOFIA AND

347
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THEY SAID SHE IS OKAY.
SHE'S COMING.

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I SAW HER WITH HER TEACHER AND

349
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WE ALL WERE TAKEN INTO THE

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
FIREHOUSE AND KEPT SO THEY COULD

351
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
DO A ROLL CALL AND MAKE SURE ALL

352
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THE STUDENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> SOFIA, IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
DAY FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS
HAPPENING.

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WERE YOU AWARE SOMEBODY WAS

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
FIRING A GUN IN THE SCHOOL?

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
>> CAN YOU HEAR, HONEY.

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> NOT REALLY.

360
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
>> WHAT SHE TOLD ME IS THEY

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
HEARD POPS IN THE HALLWAY.

362
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THE TEACHER TOLD ME ALSO,

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
COURTNEY MARTIN IS MY HERO, SHE

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
LOCKED THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AND

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
BROUGHT ALL THE KIDS TO A CORNER

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY STAYED
THERE.

367
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THEY WERE SCARED AND SHAKEN, BUT

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
ON UNTIL LATER WHEN THEY WERE

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BROUGHT INTO THE FIREHOUSE.

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
POLICE CAME AND KNOCKED ON THE

372
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
DOOR AND SAID IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
COME OUT.

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THEY GUIDED THEM TO THE BACK OF

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THE SCHOOL AND THEY WALKED OVER

376
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TO THE FIREHOUSE.

377
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THAT'S WHERE I CAUGHT UP WITH
SOFIA.

378
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
>> HOW IS SOFIA NOW?

379
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRAUMATIC

380
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
EXPERIENCE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN

381
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
WHO SURVIVED THIS.

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> I THINK SHE IS NUMB RIGHT

383
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
NOW.

384
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
SHE IS A PRETTY BRIGHT KID AND

385
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
SHE HAS A BIG SUPPORT STAFF AT

386
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
HOME AND WE LOVE HER VERY MUCH

387
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AND SHE WILL BE FINE.

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WE ARE DEVASTATED FOR THE REST
OF THE FAMILIES.

389
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WAS HURT.

390
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I DO KNOW MY CLOSE FRIENDS'S

391
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
CHILDREN ARE OKAY, BUT WE DON'T

392
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
KNOW WHO THE CHILDREN WERE.

393
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN HEAR

394
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ME OR NOT, BUT I WONDERED IF SHE

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER TODAY.

397
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,

398
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
HONEY?

399
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
ARE YOU SURE?

400
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> SHE TOO COLD NOW.

401
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
>> SHE SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME
WITH HER MOM.

402
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING DAY FOR

403
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU WERE

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
ABLE TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.

406
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
OBVIOUSLY YOUR HEART MUST GO OUT

407
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
TO THE POOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE

408
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEIR POOR

409
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.

410
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY AND

411
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT'S A CLOSE-KNIT SCHOOL AND
DEVASTATING.

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I WILL BE HERE FOR ANYBODY AND

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO ALL THE

414
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
FAMILIES.

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> I'M JUST THE LUCKIEST LADY

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
RIGHT NOW.

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
>> THANK YOU.

419
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
FOR JOINING ME.
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU.

421
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THANK YOU.

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
>> VERY LUCKY INDEED.
THE GUNMAN IS ADAM LANZA AND

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
JOINING ME IS LANZA'S FORMER

424
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
CLASSMATE, ALEX ISRAEL.

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
YOU KNEW THIS CHARACTER.

427
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
PREDICTED HE WOULD ONE DAY FLIP

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
AND DO SOMETHING AS MONSTROUS AS

430
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THIS?

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER

432
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
PREDICT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WOULD HAPPEN.

434
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GOING TO

435
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
HAPPEN TO YOUR SCHOOL AND WHERE

436
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
YOU LIVED YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD PREDICT

438
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
IT.

439
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT
HIM.

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I KNEW HIM CLOSELY WHEN WE WERE

441
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
VERY YOUNG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

442
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
TOGETHER.

443
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
DIFFERENT.

445
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
HE MOSTLY STUCK TO HIMSELF.

446
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY YOU

447
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
CAN PREDICT THIS.

448
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
>> HE WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A

449
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PRETTY CLEVER YOUNG MAN, ALMOST

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A GENIUS IN MATH.

451
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
TELL ME ABOUT THAT SIDE OF HIM.

452
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
>> I WAS NEVER IN ANY OF HIS

453
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
CLASSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
BUT YEAH, YOU COULD DEFINITELY

454
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TELL HE WAS I WOULD SAY A

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
GENIUS.
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

456
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
THERE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
ABOVE THE REST OF US.

458
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
>> DID HE HAVE FRIENDS?

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
WAS HE SOCIABLE?

460
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
>> I ALWAYS SAW HIM ALONE WHEN

461
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE

462
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
SCHOOL OR SITTING AT THE TABLE,

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
SITTING ON THE BUS.

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW MAYBE

465
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
CLOSE FRIENDS THROUGH SCHOOL OR

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THROUGH HIS CLASSES.

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
MOST OF THE TIME I SAW HIM, HE
WAS ALONE.

468
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
YEAH.

469
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS
PERSONALITY?

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET.

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
HE WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY.

473
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
A LITTLE UNEASY SOMETIMES IF YOU

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
REALLY INTO GOING OUT THERE AND

477
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
MAKING AS MANY FRIENDS AS

478
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
EVERYONE WAS DOING IN ELEMENTARY

479
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.
HE PREFERRED TO STAY TO HIMSELF.

480
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>> DID YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY, HIS

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
MOTHER IN PARTICULAR?

482
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
>> I KNEW HER BECAUSE WE LIVED

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I KNEW HER THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD

485
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
EVENTS.
MY MOM KNEW HER.

486
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
SHE WAS A VERY NICE WOMAN.

487
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A KINDER GARTEN TEACHER

488
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OBVIOUSLY.

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I DIDN'T KNOW HER PERSONALLY,

490
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
BUT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, SHE

491
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
WAS A NICE WOMAN.
>> HIS PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

492
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT HAVING A

493
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
BIG IMPACT ON HIM?

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY GOT

495
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
DIVORCED.

496
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE ABOUT
FIRST GRADE AND HE HAS ALWAYS

497
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
BEEN THE WAY I DESCRIBED HIM.

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
RESERVED AND QUIET.

499
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DIVORCE

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT OR

501
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
WHEN THEY DIVORCED.

502
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT OR

503
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MADE IT WORSE AS HE GOT OLDER

504
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
AND CAME MORE RESERVED.

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT AFFECTED

506
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
IT.

507
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
>> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

508
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
AND WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE

509
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
REACTION WHEN YOU DISCOVERED IT

510
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WAS THIS PERSON YOU KNEW?

511
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> IT WAS DEVASTATING.

512
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'M IN LONDON NOW STUDYING HERE

513
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
FOR THE SEMESTER AND COMING HOME

514
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ON THURSDAY TO THIS.

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I FOUND OUT FIRST EARLY THIS

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
MORNING I GUESS PROBABLY WHEN IT
BROKE AT HOME.

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IT WAS AROUND 2:00 AND THE FIRST

518
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
INFORMATION OF IT, IT'S

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
DEVASTATING IN A TOWN WHERE YOU

520
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
HAVE KNOWN UP.

521
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I FELT SAFE MY WHOLE LIFE AND I

522
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
WAS RAISED IN THAT ELEMENTARY

523
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

524
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THERE AND FINDING OUT IT WAS

525
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SOMEONE I KNEW WHO HAD DONE ALL

526
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
OF THIS IS JUST UPSETTING.

527
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOULD

528
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
EVER HAPPEN.

529
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
>> THE COMMUNITY AROUND NEWTOWN,

530
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT?

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'M HEARING IT WAS A VERY QUIET

532
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
PLACE.
STUFF LIKE THIS JUST NEVER

533
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HAPPENS.

534
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THEY DON'T GET MANY SHOOTINGS

535
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
AND GUN MURDERS.

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL KIND OF
PLACE IN THAT SENSE.

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
>> NO.

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I MEAN IT'S A PRETTY BIG TOWN

539
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
SPACE-WISE.

540
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
WE SPAN OVER A PRETTY VAST ARRAY

541
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
OF LAND, BUT IT'S REALLY

542
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
CLOSE-KNIT IN THAT EVERYONE

543
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
KNOWS EACH OTHER AND IS CLOSE

544
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
WITH EACH OTHER AND THE SCHOOL

545
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SYSTEMS ARE CLOSE.

546
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
YOU GROW UP WITH THESE PEOPLE

547
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
AND GO TO SCHOOL WITH THEM.

548
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
EVERYONE REALLY CAME TOGETHER, I

549
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THINK, THROUGH THIS AND IS

550
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER QUITE

551
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
WELL.

552
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THAT'S ONE GOOD THING TO COME

553
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OUT OF IT IF ANYTHING.

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
SPOKE TO ADAM LANZA?

555
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
>> PROBABLY MIDDLE SCHOOL.

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONNECTION
WITH HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

557
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL PROBABLY.

558
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THE LAST TIME I SAID A WORD TO
HIM.

559
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
>> YOUR SUMMARY IS KIND OF

560
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
FIDGETY AND SLIGHTLY A LONER AND

561
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
NOT MASSIVELY SOCIABLE, BUT NOT

562
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
APPARENTLY DANGEROUS.

563
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
>> NO, I MEAN I NEVER NOTICED

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ANYTHING SCARY OR VIOLENT OR

565
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

566
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED THAT

567
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
FROM HIM, I DON'T THINK.

568
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
JUST FOR SOMEONE WHO SORT OF

569
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
WENT UNDER THE RADAR AND KEPT TO
THEMSELVES, YOU WOULDN'T REALLY

570
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THINK OF THEM AS DOING SOMETHING

571
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
CRAZY LIKE THIS.

572
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
>> IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HECK OF A

573
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
SHOCK TO YOU AND I AM GRATEFUL

574
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000

WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION ON THE

GUNMAN.

631
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WHAT COULD HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO DO

THIS?

633
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
LET'S START WITH YOU IF I MAY.
I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY OF

634
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS AND

635
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
POSSIBLY NOTHING AS APPALLING AS

636
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
THIS.

637
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN WITH

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
AURORA AND THE SHOPPING MALL

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
WHAT IS DRIVING THEM?

00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE BACKGROUND

646
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

647
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
>> WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE

648
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
CASES THERE A NUMBER OF

649
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
DIFFERENT CAUSES THAT CAN BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD

650
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
CATEGORIES.

651
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ONE CATEGORY IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

652
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THAT TRAIT OF A LOSS OF EMPATHY

653
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
AND INABILITY TO CONNECT TO

654
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
OTHER PEOPLE AND A HISTORY OF

655
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
CRUELTY OR WHAT PEOPLE TALK

656
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ABOUT AS SOCIOPATHS OR

657
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY.

658
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
AT THE OTHER END PEOPLE WITH

659
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
BRAIN DISORDERS AND SERIOUS

660
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE

661
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
UNTREATED OR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

662
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
HAPPENING IN THEIR LIFE,

663
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
EXACERBATED BY STRESS.

664
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LITTLE BIT

665
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THAT IS COMING OUT, WE ARE MORE
IN A DIRECTION THAT THIS IS

666
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN DISORDER

667
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STORY

668
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO

669
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
UNCOVER IT.

670
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
THERE IS NOTHING SUDDEN ABOUT

671
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
ANY OF THESE STORIES.

672
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THAT'S THE HEADLINE FOR ME.

673
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
IT'S SUDDEN FOR US THAT THIS

674
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
HAPPENED.

675
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
AS YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE

676
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
STORY, I ASSURE YOU THE WARNING

677
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
SIGNS WERE THERE.

678
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
NOT THAT THEY WERE IGNORED, BUT

679
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THEY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED.

680
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
>> ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS AS

681
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
LIKELY TO CARRY OUT WHAT THEY

682
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
END UP DOING IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

683
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS?

684
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> LOOK, THERE IS NO QUESTION

685
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT FIREARMS PLAY A ROLE.

686
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE

687
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000

TO MAKE BOMBS AND AT LEAST ONE

691
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
CASE I WORKED ON.

692
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
FIREARMS ARE CERTAINLY AN

693
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE,

694
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
BUT UNDERSTANDING WHEN SOMEBODY

695
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS IF IT

696
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
IT I HAS PLAYED A ROLE HERE AND

697
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I KNOW THAT

698
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
IT HAS, THAT SHOULD BE

699
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
CONSIDERED BEFORE ALLOWING THAT

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
PERSON TO HAVE A FIREARM.

701
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
>> FRANK, YOU SPECIALIZE IN

702
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TREATING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

703
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
AND THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE.

704
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
A VERY PARTICULAR PROBLEM HERE

705
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
WITH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE
SCHOOL WHO HAVE LUCKILY

706
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
SURVIVED.

707
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
HAVING TO DEAL NOW WITH THE

708
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
HORROR OF LOSING POSSIBLE

709
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
FRIENDS AND PEOPLE THAT THEY

710
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
KNEW FROM THE SCHOOL AND

711
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
TEACHERS AND THE HEAD TEACHER

712
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
AND SO ON.

713
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
WHERE DO YOU START WITH TRYING

714
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
TO COUNSEL YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN
THIS KIND OF APPALLING THING

715
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
HAPPENS?

716
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
>> I THINK THE FIRST THING IS

717
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HELPING THE PARENTS.

718
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THE CHILDREN LOOK TO THEIR

719
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
PARENTS AND FOR THE PARENTS,

720
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
SOME OF THEM ARE STUNNED.

721
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THEY ARE GRIEVING.

722
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THEY LOST A PRECIOUS 6-YEAR-OLD.

723
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
FOR THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES,

724
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
SOMETIMES CHILDREN WHO GO

725
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THROUGH THIS AND DO SURVIVE TAKE

726
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
A WHILE TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF IT.

727
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
THEY MAY REGRESS AND MOVE

728
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
BACKWARDS A YEAR OR TWO IN TERMS

729
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
OF THEIR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT.

730
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SOME OF THEM WILL FIGURE OUT

731
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
YEARS LATER WHAT ACTUALLY

732
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
HAPPENED.

733
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SOME ARE GOING TO DO RELATIVELY

734
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
WELL.

735
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THEY WILL BE SADDER AND WISER IN

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
A WAY.

737
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT

738
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I SEE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

739
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
THAT COMMUNITY IS COMING

740
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
TOGETHER.

741
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
PEOPLE ARE LOVING EACH OTHER.

742
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS COME TO REMIND

743
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
US THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO
CARES AND HE CAME AS A FATHER.

744
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I AM A FATHER AND A GRANDFATHER.

745
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I HAVE CALLED MY CHILDREN AND I

746
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING

747
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

748
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
AS WE COME TOGETHER, WE DO THE

749
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
BEST THAT WE CAN AT A SAD TIME

750
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
LIKE THIS.

751
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
>> I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS

752
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WHY WOULD THIS SHOOTER DO WHAT

753
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
HE DID?

754
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
GO TO A CLASSROOM AND MURDER SO

755
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
MANY YOUNG CHILDREN OF SUCH A

756
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
YOUNG TENDER AGE, POSSIBLY THE

757
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
CLASSROOM THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

758
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
ALREADY KILLED AT THEIR HOME.

759
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
CAN YOU TRY TO PIECE FROM YOUR

760
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
EXPERIENCE THE THOUGHT PROCESS

761
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
HERE?

762
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
WHY HE WOULD THEN HAVING KILLED

763
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
HIS MOTHER GO TO THE SCHOOL AND

764
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
DO WHAT HE DID?

765
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL

766
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
AND I HAVEN'T DIAGNOSED OR

767
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ASSESSED HIM.

768
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE
NOT MORE VIOLENT.

769
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT

770
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THAT.
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THAT'S NOT THE DATA THAT WE

772
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
HAVE.

773
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
IF INDEED MENTAL ILLNESS IS A

774
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
PART OF THIS, THERE IS A

775
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
PARTICULAR PATH THAT NEEDS TO BE

776
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
LOOKED AT.

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
ARE THEY DEPRESSED AND

778
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED.

779
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
HIS ROOMMATE ALEX ISRAEL SAID HE

780
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
PREFERRED TO STAY ALONE.

781
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
A SYMPTOM OF ASPERGER'S AND

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
ONE REPORT COMING OUT WHICH MAY

783
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE.

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
SOMETHING IS MISSING IN THE

785
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
BRAIN.

786
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
A SENSE OF EMPATHY AND SOCIAL

787
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
CONNECTION THAT LEAVES THIS

788
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
PERSON SUFFERING FROM THIS

789
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
CONDITION.

790
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THEY ARE PRONE TO SERIOUS

791
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.
IF THEY ARE SUICIDALLY

792
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
DEPRESSED, WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

793
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IN

794
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
AGREEING TO COME HERE IS TO ASK

795
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
PEOPLE TO DON'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT

796
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
ABOUT WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS.

797
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
IF IT WAS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

798
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
PLAYED A ROLE, IT'S AN

799
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO BETTER.

800
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
>> THERE IS A SCHOOL THAT YOU

801
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM ATTENTION AND

802
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
NAME HIM AND SO ON BECAUSE IT

803
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
BRINGS ATTENTION TO HIM.

804
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
HE'S DEAD SO HE WON'T BE ABLE TO

805
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
BASK IN THE APPALLING GLORY OF

806
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
WHAT HE DID, BUT SECONDLY THESE

807
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
-- THERE'S A PATTEN OF THESE

808
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
YOUNG MEN.

809
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
>> YOU CAN MAKE AN ASSUMPTION

810
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THAT WE WANTS TO BASK IN THE

811
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
GLORY OF WHAT HE DID.

812
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I HAVE MET SHOOTERS.

813
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS WITH

814
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING

815
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
LIKE THAT.

816
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT

817
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
GLORY.
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY ILL.

818
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AND OTHERS THAT DO WANT GLORY.

819
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
SO YOU ARE RUSHING TO THE AN
INTERPRETATION ON THIS.

820
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
>> SORRY.

821
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ENDORSE THAT

822
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
ALSO.

823
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I KNOW FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY, WE

824
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS

825
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
HAPPENED.

826
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
WHEN YOU ARE A PARENT YOU CAN'T

827
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE

828
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ASKING.
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

829
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
ANSWERING THEM.
WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAD

830
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES RECENTLY,

831
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
YES, THESE WERE SIMILAR IN THAT

832
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
GUNS WERE USED AND THEY WERE

833
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
SPREE KILLINGS AND MASS

834
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
KILLINGS.
I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEDICAL

835
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
DOCTOR AND PSYCHIATRIST WHO

836
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
WORKED CLOSELY ON CASES, THERE

837
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
WERE DIFFERENT MOTIVES AND

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
MENTALITIES.

839
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

840
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
CONSCIOUS.

841
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THEY TORTURE ANIMALS.

842
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN THEIR MIND

843
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
FOR EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY.

844
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
THEY LEARN HOW TO FAKE IT.

845
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I BELIEVE ONE OF THE COLUMBINE

846
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
KILLERS FIT THAT PATTERN, BUT

847
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THE OTHER WAS COMPLETELY

848
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
DIFFERENT.
HE WAS NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

849
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
IN THE CASE OF THE AURORA

850
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
SHOOTER, THE JURY IS NOT IN YET,

851
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL
FIND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

852
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT

853
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS.

854
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ONE TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS

855
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

856
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PROGRAM OF MENTAL HEALTH
SERVICES IN AMERICA.

857
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I HAVE TO ADMIT WE FAILED.

858
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
WE FAILED AMERICA IN PROTECTING

859
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THE LIVES OF THE SERIOUSLY

860
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MENTALLY ILL.

861
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
MOST OF WHAT THEY DO IS SUFFER

862
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
IN SILENCE.

863
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
THEIR FAMILIES WANT TO DO BETTER

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
BY THEM AND AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE

865
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
NOT STEPPED UP AND BEEN

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SYMPATHETIC AND CARING AND

867
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERIOUSLY

868
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
MENTALLY ILL.

869
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
>> AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT.

870
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS YOU

871
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
BOTH HAVE MADE EXTREMELY VALID

872
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
POINTS.

873
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
YOU HAVE THREE SUCCESSIVE

874
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
APPALLING MASS SHOOTINGS

875
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
INVOLVING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s

876
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
WHERE THE BACKGROUND TO ALL OF

877
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THEM, FROM PEOPLE THAT KNEW THEM

878
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WAS NOT DISSIMILAR.

879
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
THEY SEEM TO BE FAIRLY NORMA

880
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
KIND OF SLIGHTLY OFF, BUT

881
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
NOTHING WITH ALARM BELLS.
THE POINT OF EXAMINING THEIR

882
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
CHARACTER IS THAT THERE MUST BE

883
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE

884
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
OTHERS LIKE THAT OUT THERE WHO

885
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
MAY BE CONSIDERING SIMILAR

886
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
ATROCITIES.

887
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
HOW DO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THESE

888
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
TYPES OF PEOPLE SPOT ANY WARNING

889
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
SIGNS?

890
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
>> PIERS --

891
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
>> PIERS --

892
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
>> LET ME START WITH THE DOCTOR.

893
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
>> I'M SORRY.

894
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN.

895
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
BEFORE THIS INTERVIEW THEY ASKED

896
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
ME WHAT I WAS DOING AND WE

897
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT AN

898
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HOUR AND A HALF.

899
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
MY 9-YEAR-OLD GOT FRIGHTENED, HE

900
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
GOES TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

901
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THESE

902
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THINGS ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

903
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS

904
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

905
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED

906
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
IN THE LAST MONTH DOESN'T

907
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
STATISTICALLY MAKE IT A COMMON
OCCURRENCE.

908
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
LET'S BE CLEAR AND TELL OUR
CHILDREN THAT.

909
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
AVERAGE GUN.

1088
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS AND

1089
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
KILLED 20 CHILDREN.

1090
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
20 CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 10.

1091
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WE GET IT?

1092
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE?

1093
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
>> IT IS TIME.

1094
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WE HAVE LOOKED --

1095
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
>> TIME TO DO WHAT?

1096
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
>> TO GET RID OF THE GUN LAWS --

1097
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
>> WHICH ONES?

1098
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

1099
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ALL OF THESE OCCUR WRD GUNS ARE

1100
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
BANNED.

1101
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
LOOK AT THE AURORA MOVIE THEATER

1102
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
SHOOTING.
>> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO

1103
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
WITH IT?

1104
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SERIOUSLY?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH

1105
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
IT.
>> YOU NEVER LET ME EXPLAIN.

1106
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
>> YOU THINK BECAUSE IT IS A

1107
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
GUN-FREE ZONE.

1108
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
>> LOOK AT THE AURORA MOVIE

1109
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THEATER FOR EXAMPLE.

1110
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
SEVERAL THEATERS SHOWING THE

1111
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
"BATMAN" MOVIE WITHIN A

1112
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
20-MINUTE DRIVE.

1113
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
ONLY ONE OF THOSE BANNED GUNS.

1114
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
HE DIDN'T GO CLOSE TOAST HIS
HOME OR WITH THE LARGEST SCREEN.

1115
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
HE WENT TO THE ONE MOVIE THEATER

1116
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THAT BANNED GUNS.
IF YOU LOOK AT BANS GENERALLY,

1117
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
YOU CAN'T POINT TO A PLACE,

1118
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
CHICAGO, D.C. WHERE WE BAN GUNS

1119
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
AND MURDER RATES AND VIOLENT
CRIMES WENT UP.

1120
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
IN THE UK IN JAMAICA AND

1121
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
IRELAND, ISLAND NATIONS THAT

1122
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
BANNED GUNS, YOU CAN'T FIND A

1123
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
PLACE WHERE MURDER RATES HAVE

1124
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
GONE DOWN.

1125
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THEY HAVE GONE UP USUALLY BY

1126
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
LARGE AMOUNTS.

1127
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
>> YOU CANNOT FIND A PLACE --

1128
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
>> LET ME BRING IN.

1129
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, BASICALLY EVERY

1130
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
STATISTIC THAT JOHN CITED IS

1131
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
PURE BUNK IN TERMS OF THE FACT

1132
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THAT THE MORE GUNS EQUAL --

1133
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THAT'S TRUE.

1134
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THEY WERE GUN-FREE ZONES, BUT

1135
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
ATTRIBUTING THAT TO THE FACT

1136
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THAT THIS VIOLENCE OCCURRED,

1137
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO STEP IN.

1138
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
LISTEN, MY BROTHER WAS SHOT IN A

1139
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
SHOOTING ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE

1140
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
STATE BUILDING WHICH WAS

1141
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
CHAOTIC.

1142
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I KNOW FIRSTHAND.

1143
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I TALKED WITH THE VICTIMS FROM

1144
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THE AURORA TRAGEDY.

1145
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
TO A PERSON, THEY ALL SAY IF
THERE WERE ANOTHER PERSON ARMED,

1146
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
IT WOULD HAVE LED TO MORE

1147
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
CARNAGE.
EXCUSE ME.
I LET YOU TALK, LET ME FINISH.

1148
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
LET ME FINISH.

1149
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
IN EVERY ONE OF THE CASES THEY

1150
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
SAY IF THERE WERE MORE GUNS, IT

1151
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
WOULD HAVE ONLY LED TO MORE
CHAOS.

1152
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
AT THE EMPIRE BUILDING SHOOTING

1153
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
IN NEW YORK.

1154
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THERE WERE HIGHLY TRAINED

1155
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE

1156
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CHAOS.
THERE WERE EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE

1157
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
SHOT AND EVERY ONE WAS AN

1158
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
INNOCENT CIVILIAN AND EVERY ONE

1159
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WAS SHOT BY THESE LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

1160
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
>> WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY FOR THE
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

1161
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

1162
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

1163
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1164
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>> I BELIEVE THOSE OF US WHO ARE

1165
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
LICENSED TO CARRY ARE

1166
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AND SHOULDN'T

1167
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
BE PROHIBITED FROM CARRYING IN

1168
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
SCHOOLS OR OTHER PLACES.

1169
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
IN FACT, THE MICHIGAN

1170
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL LAST

1171
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
NIGHT AND SENT TO THE GOVERNOR

1172
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
FOR SIGNATURE A BILLE THAT WILL

1173
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
ALLOW THOSE WHO ARE LICENSED TO

1174
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
TAKE ONE MORE DAY OF TRAINING

1175
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
INCLUDING RANGE TIME AND CARRY

1176
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
IN PLACES WHERE WE COULDN'T

1177
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
CARRY BEFORE.

1178
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
>> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT

1179
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS AFTER WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY?

1180
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
>> HERE'S WHY, PIERS.
IF WE COULD SUDDENLY MAKE ALL

1181
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
GUNS DISAPPEAR, I WOULD HAVE A

1182
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
DIFFERENT POSITION.

1183
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING

1184
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
ABOUT THIS AND READING ABOUT

1185
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
IT.

1186
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I TEACH A CLASS AT THE LAW

1187
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
SCHOOL LEVEL CALLED GUN CONTROL

1188
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SEMINAR.

1189
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND I GET A NEW GROUP EVERY TIME

1190
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
AND WE DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL.

1191
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THE SIMPLE FACTS ARE GUNS EXIST.

1192
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY 1800s

1193
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1194
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SEMI AUTOMOBILES WERE IN THE
LATE 1800s.

1195
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
THEY ARE EASY TO MAKE AND LAST
SEVERAL HUMAN LIFETIMES WITH

1196
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
MINIMAL MAINTENANCE.

1197
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SINCE GUNS EXIST AND WE KNOW FOR

1198
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
A FACT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO STOP

1199
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
AN EVIL PERSON, LIKE THE PERSON

1200
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
YOU WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER IN

1201
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THE SHOW IS TO --

1202
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
>> THIS IS EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT

1203
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I HAVE BEEN HEARING EVER SINCE I
JOINED CNN.

1204
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I JOINED ON AIR ABOUT A WEEK
AFTER GABBY GIFFORDS THE

1205
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
CONGRESSWOMAN WAS SHOT IN THE

1206
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
HEAD.
EVER SINCE THEN, WE HAVE THE

1207
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SIKH TEMPLE AND AURORA AND THE

1208
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
SHOPPING MALL AND SO ON AND SO

1209
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
ON.

1210
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
A GUY DOWNSTAIRS SHOT IN THE

1211
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
HEAD FROM OUR NEW YORK BUREAU
ARE.

1212
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THE ARGUMENT I KEEP HEARING IF
EVERYBODY WAS WAS ARMED, IT

1213
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

1214
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
IT'S A LOAD OF TOTAL HOGWASH,

1215
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
ISN'T IT?
IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

1216
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
THEATER HAD GUNS, MORE PEOPLE

1217
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE
MAYHEM THAT ERUPTED.

1218
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
>> THE PEOPLE THAT STOPPED THE

1219
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
ATTACKS.
>>> CAN I JUST --

1220
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
>> THE PROVE IN THE PUDDING.

1221
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
YOU DON'T SEE OTHER SHOOTINGS AT

1222
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
GUN SHOWS OR --

1223
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
>> YOU CAN'T GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE

1224
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
WHERE BYSTANDERS WERE HIT IN THE

1225
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

1226
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
>> PROOF IS MANY THE BUILDING.

1227
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> YOU DON'T SEE MASS SHOOTINGS

1228
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
AT GUN SHOWS OR SHOOTING RANGES.

1229
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
>> THEY HAVE REASONABLE GUN

1230
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
CONTROL LAWS AND THEY HAVE A

1231
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR NOT 9,000

1232
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
OR

1233
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
10,000 A YEAR.

1234
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
>> LISTEN --

1235
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
>> IT WAS LOWER BEFORE GUN
CONTROL.

1236
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
>> THEY GOT THE GUN CONTROL.

1237
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
>> ALMOST ZERO CRIME.
>> THE GUN CONTROL DOESN'T

1238
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
CHANGE IT.
>> SCOTLAND IN 1996 THERE WAS A

1239
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
SIMILAR SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1240
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
JUST AN AWFUL SITUATION.

1241
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
16 YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED EXACTLY

1242
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
AS THEY WERE TODAY.

1243
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
AS A RESULT OF THIS, THEY

1244
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
BROUGHT IN A HAND GUN BAN.

1245
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
162,000 HAND GUNS WERE HANDED

1246
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
IN.

1247
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
IT IS TIME FOR THIS.

1248
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
>> LISTEN --
>> MURDER RATES WENT UP.

1249
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
>> THERE ABOUT 35 MURDERS A

1250
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
YEAR.

1251
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THERE 12,000 MURDERS A YEAR FROM

1252
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1253
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
>> THE POINT IS --

1254
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
>> WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FOCUS

1255
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
ON THAT AND STOP TELLING ME THE

1256
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
ANSWER IS MORE GUNS.

1257
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
IT'S NOT THE ANSWER.

1258
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
>> LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

1259
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
>> AFTER THE BAN IT WAS HIGHER

1260
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
THAN BEFORE THE BAN.

1261
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
>> YOU WANT MORE GUNS, NOT LESS.

1262
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN AMERICA

1263
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU?

1264
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
>> WHEN YOU BAN GUNS --

1265
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
>> HOW MANY KIDS HAVE TO DIE

1266
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
BEFORE YOU SAY WE WANT LESS

1267
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
GUNS, NOT MORE.

1268
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU

1269
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
SOMETHING --
>> LET MINIMUM ANSWER THE

1270
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
QUESTION.
>> I'M UPSET BECAUSE I'M WORRIED

1271
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
THE GUN CONTROL LAWS YOU ARE

1272
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
PUSH HAVING KILLED PEOPLE.

1273
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> WHAT A LOAD OF NONSENSE.

1274
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
>> YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

1275
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
>> AVERAGE OF 35 KILLINGS WITH

1276
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
GUNS IN A BRITAIN A YEAR.

1277
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
IN HERE, NO BAN ON GUNS AND

1278
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
12,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIE FROM

1279
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
GUN MURDERS.

1280
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
>> THE DIFFERENCE --

1281
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

1282
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
>> MY I HAVE THE TUNE TO SAY

1283
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
SOMETHING WITHOUT SCREAMING?

1284
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
>> I HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS ALL

1285
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
WEEK, FOLLOWING THE BOB COSTAS

1286
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
THING, I HAVE BEEN DEBATING IT

1287
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS.

1288
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'M SO FRUSTRATED AND FURIOUS

1289
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THAT THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN BLOWN

1290
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AWAY AGAIN WITH LEGALLY ACQUIRED

1291
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
WEAPONS.
BOY WHO'S GOT PROBLEMS TAKE HIS

1292
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
MOTHERS THREE WEAPONENS

1293
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
INCLUDING THIS RIDICULOUS

1294
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
ASSAULT RIFLE AND WALKS IN TO

1295
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SCHOOL AND YOU GUYS WANT TO TELL

1296
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
ME THE ANSWER IS MORE GUNS.

1297
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
IT IS MADNESS.

1298
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
>> HOW CAN YOU STOP SOMEBODY

1299
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
FROM SHOOTING PEOPLE?

1300
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
>> LET THE CONGRESSMAN SPEAK.

1301
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> WHAT I WOULD BE MOST ANGRY

1302
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
ABOUT IS THAT EVERY POLL SHOWS

1303
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
BY MASSIVE MAJORITIES AMERICANS

1304
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

1305
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
AND YET WE HAVE A LOBBY, THE

1306
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
LEADERSHIP OF THE NRA WHO

1307
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
FUNCTION AS ENABLERS OF MASS

1308
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
MURDERERS, THEY ARE ENABLERS OF

1309
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
MASS MURDER BECAUSE THEY

1310
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
TERRIFIED THE CLASS OF PEOPLE
AND EVEN THOUGH.

1311
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
>> ABSOLUTE SLI NOT.

1312
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
>> POLLING SHOWS MOST NRA

1313
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
MEMBERS WILL OPPOSE REASONABLE

1314
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
GUN CONTROLS BUT THEY LIE AND

1315
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
SAY THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR

1316
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
GUNS AND TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY.

1317
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
>> NO ONE OUTSIDE OF A POLICE

1318
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
OFFICER OR MILITARY NEEDS ONE OF

1319
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
THESE IN THEIR HOUSE.

1320
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
NOBODY.
>> WE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.

1321
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
>> LISTEN, THE ENCOURAGING THING

1322
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
AND WHAT YOU SHOULD TAKE

1323
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
INSPIRATION BECAUSE WE ARE ALL

1324
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
FRUSTRATED AND OUTRAGED.

1325
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
THIS CONVERSATION DOES NOT

1326
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
REPRESENT WHAT THE AMERICAN

1327
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
PUBLIC.

1328
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
WANTS.

1329
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE

1330
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
CONVERSATION THAT AMERICAN
PUBLIC WANTS TO HAVE.

1331
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
WE ARE IN FAVOR OF BACKGROUND

1332
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
CHECKS.

1333
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
74% OF NRA MEMBERS ARE AND MOST
GUN SALES DO NOT REQUIRE A

1334
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
BACKGROUND CHECK.
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

1335
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
>> IT'S NOT AS THEY TRY TO TELL

1336
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
ME AN ANTI-AMERICAN THING TO SAY

1337
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT
AND I RESPECT THE RIGHT FOR A

1338
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
FAMILY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

1339
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I DON'T RESPECT FAMILIES TO LOAD
THEIR HOMES WITH THESE SO A

1340
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
DISTURBED KID CAN TAKE THEM.

1341
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WE ARE ENDING THE DEBATE FOR

1342
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
NOW.

1343
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
>> WE ARE ENDING THE DEBATE FOR

1344
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
NOW BUT THIS WILL CONTINUE NEXT

1345
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
WEEK.
I GUARANTEE IT.

1346
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
>> COME BACK NEXT WEEK WHEN YOU

1347
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
HAVE HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT

1348
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE

1349
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
YOUR THINKING.

1350
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
THE GUN LOBBY HAS TO CHANGE ITS

1351
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
THINKING.

1352
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.

1353
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
COMING UP NEXT, SURVIVORS FROM

1354
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
OTHER MASS SHOOTINGS SHARE THEIR

1355
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THOUGHTS ON TODAY'S APPALLING

1356
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
MASSACRE.

1357
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
A SIMILAR PICTURE FROM ANOTHER

1358
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
MASS SHOOTING IN '9959 A JEWISH

1359
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
COMMUNITY CENTER?

1360
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
CALIFORNIA.
A 6-YEAR-OLD WAS SHOT IN THE LEG

1361
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
AND I AM JOINED BY MINDY FINKLE

1362
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
STEIN.

1363
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
WELCOME TO YOU ALL.

1364
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
LET ME START, IF I MAY, WITH

1365
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
YOU.

1366
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THIS MUST HAVE BROUGHT BACK

1367
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
AWFUL MEMORIES FOR YOU, AS I

1368
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
DOES WHENEVER THERE IS A MASS

1369
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SHOOTING IN AMERICA.

1370
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
WHAT WERER YOUR FEELINGS?

1371
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT WORDS

1372
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TO WHAT I REALLY FEEL.

1373
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IT'S A MIXTURE OF SYMPATHY AND

1374
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DISGUST.

1375
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE

1376
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
FAMILIES.
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1377
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
GONE THROUGH THE SAME THING AND

1378
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE

1379
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
GOING THROUGH.

1380
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
IMMEDIATELY WHAT I THOUGHT IS I

1381
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD

1382
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
DO TO HELP THEM.

1383
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
IN REALITY, IT'S A HELPLESS

1384
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
SITUATION.

1385
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
>> MINDY, YOU SURVIVED WHAT

1386
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
HAPPENED TO YOU.

1387
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THE RAGING GUN

1388
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
DEBATES, WHICH I'M SURE WILL BE

1389
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
PARTICULARLY VOCIFEROUS IN LIGHT

1390
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
OF THE APPALLING INCIDENT TODAY,

1391
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
DO YOU WISH AFTER WHAT HAPPENED

1392
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
TO YOU AND JOSH THAT TOUGHER

1393
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
LAWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AFTER

1394
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
THAT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING

1395
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
ABOUT THIS?

1396
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DO.

1397
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I THINK THAT JOSH AND I, AND

1398
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY IN

1399
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
THIS WEIRD FAMILY THAT WE HAVE

1400
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
OF SURVIVORS OF GUN LAWS WISHES

1401
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
THE DAY AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO

1402
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
THEM NOBODY ELSE HAS TO GO

1403
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
THROUGH IT AND UNFORTUNATELY

1404
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
13 1/2 YEARS LATER WE ARE

1405
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SITTING HERE WATCHING THESE

1406
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
TRAGEDIES UNFOLD ON A DAILY

1407
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
BASIS YOU WERE I THINK 16 AT THE

1408
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
TIME OF THE SHOOTING.

1409
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE KIDS AT

1410
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
THE SCHOOL TODAY WILL BE MUCH
YOUNGER THAN THAT AND THEY WILL

1411
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
HAVE LOST FRIENDS OR PEOPLE THEY

1412
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
KNEW AT THE SCHOOL.
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT WHEN

1413
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.

1414
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE THEM?

1415
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL
WITH THIS?

1416
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1417
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
>> YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

1418
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
HEART BREAKING BECAUSE THEY ARE

1419
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
NOT GOING TO KNOW REALLY WHAT,

1420
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
OR HOW TO FEEL UNTIL FIVE, TEN

1421
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
YEARS FROM NOW WHEN IT KEEPS

1422
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
HAUNTING THEM AND NIGHTMARES AND

1423
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
FEARS THAT KEEP COMING UP.

1424
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
JOSH CAN SPEAK TO THAT HIMSELF.

1425
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
HE WAS 6 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

1426
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
AND NOW HE'S IN HIS 20s AND IT

1427
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HAUNTS HIM EVERY DAY.

1428
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I WAS 16.

1429
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I KNEW WHY I WAS SHOT AND I KNEW

1430
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME AND

1431
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
EVERY DAY, I'M ALMOST 30 YEARS

1432
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
OLD, I'M HAUNTED.

1433
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY TO

1434
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
THEM EXCEPT I'M SO, SO SORRY

1435
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS.

1436
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I REALLY TRULY HOPE THAT

1437
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
SOMETHING WILL BE DONE AFTER

1438
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT STAND

1439
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
FOR THIS ANYMORE.

1440
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
>> STEVEN, YOU SURVIVED THE

1441
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
AURORA MASSACRE.
THAT WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO.

1442
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THERE WAS A HUGE OUTCRY THEN AND

1443
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
PEOPLE PROMISED TO DO ALL SORTS

1444
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
OF THINGS.

1445
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
POLITICIAN MOUTHS, ABSOLUTELY

1446
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
NOTHING HAPPENED.

1447
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AND HERE WE ARE WITH A WORSE

1448
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
TRAGEDY, EVEN MORE DEAD AND THIS

1449
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
TIME 20 YOUNG KIDS.

1450
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE

1451
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
DEBATE THAT WILL NOW UNFOLD IN

1452
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
THIS?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID

1453
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THAT WE NEED A MEANINGFUL ACTION

1454
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
NOW.
HE SAID THAT IN THE PAST, SO,

1455
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I'LL BE WAITING FOR THAT ACTION.

1456
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
IT'S A SHAME THAT 20 CHILDREN

1457
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
HAVE TO BE SLAIN FOR US TO EVEN

1458
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
START TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

1459
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I REALLY THINK THE AMERICAN

1460
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
PUBLIC IS FED UP WITH THE LACK

1461
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
OF CONVERSATION ON THIS ISSUE.

1462
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
>> THERE HAVE BEEN MORE MASS

1463
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FIVE OR

1464
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
SIX YEARS THAN I THINK THE

1465
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
PREVIOUS FOUR DECADES IN TERMS

1466
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
OF THESE PARTICULARLY APPALLING

1467
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
ONES AN YOU KEEP BEING TOLD IT

1468
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IS NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS, THE

1469
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
SITUATION BUT IT TRULY IS.

1470
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE I HAVE

1471
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BEEN UTTERLY HORRIFIED.

1472
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
THAT'S WHY I GET SO ANIMATED

1473
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
WHEN I DEBATE THIS ON THE SHOW

1474
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
BECAUSE I COME FROM A COUNTRY

1475
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
WHERE THIS WOULD BE UNTHINKING,

1476
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
SHOPPING MALLS, KINDERGARTEN

1477
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
CLASSROOMS COULD BE SHOT DOWN ON

1478
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
AN ALMOST BIMONTHLY BASIS.

1479
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY AMERICANS

1480
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
AREN'T FAR MORE ANGRY.

1481
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
>> IT'S ONE THING FOR

1482
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
POLITICIANS TO TAKE ACTION.

1483
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

1484
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC DEMANDS THESE

1485
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
REFORMS, THESE CHANGES.

1486
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
THE POLLING IS CLEAR.

1487
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THERE'S SUPPORT FOR COMMON SENSE
GUN REFORM.

1488
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
82% OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT

1489
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1490
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
IT'S A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM WE

1491
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THAT POINT

1492
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
YET.
>> PAULA, YOUR BROTHER WAS

1493
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
KILLED IN THE EMPIRE STATE

1494
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
BUILDING.
WHEN WE TALKED BEFORE YOU

1495
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
BELIEVED TO VE RIGHT TO HAVE A

1496
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
HANDGUN AND A REFERENDUM WASN'T

1497
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
NEEDED.

1498
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
WHAT DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

1499
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
>> THE WAKE OF TODAY, A

1500
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
REFERENDUM ON GUNS IS NEEDED.

1501
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I WAS TALKING THE DAY MY BROTHER

1502
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
WAS MURDERED.

1503
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
AS A FATHER, WITH INNOCENT

1504
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
CHILDREN, I SEE THE HEART BREAK.

1505
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT.

1506
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
WE HAVE 26 FAMILIES THAT ARE

1507
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
DEVASTATED RIGHT NOW.

1508
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
THIS IS A DEBATE ABOUT GUN

1509
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
CONTROL AND MENTAL ILLNESS.

1510
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
IT IS A COMBINATION.

1511
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
>> INCLUDING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES

1512
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
AND VIOLENT HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.

1513
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
THE GUN VIOLENT CULTURE IN

1514
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
AMERICA HAS TO BE TACKLED.

1515
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
ALL AREAS.

1516
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
THERE'S GOT TO BE A PROPER

1517
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
DEBATE.
MY ARGUMENT IS THE POLITICIANS

1518
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS DEBATE.

1519
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
>> THEY HAVE TO.

1520
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
THEY HAVE TO.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONGRESSMAN

1521
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
LIKE JERRY NADLER, A REPUBLICAN

1522
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
CONGRESSMAN STEP UP AND GET

1523
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
TOGETHER.
THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN
