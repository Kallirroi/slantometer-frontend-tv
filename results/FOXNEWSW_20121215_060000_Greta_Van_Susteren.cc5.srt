HALLWAYS BECAUSE THE SHOTS WERE

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
FIRED IN AN AREA WHERE THE

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000

SCHOOL WHERE THEY, OF COURSE,

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SHOULD BE SAFE.

117

WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO TEACHES

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000

NO.

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I LEFT THE SCHOOL, WE GENERALLY

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THEN LEAVE.
THE STUDENTS COME IN TO GO TO

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000

THAT'S WHEN WE TURN THEM OVER TO

141

THE REGULAR TEACHERS.

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
UNTHINKABLE THAT THIS COULD

147
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
HAPPEN.

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH MY

188
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
SENIOR HERE, HE SPENT THE DAY

189
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WITH SOME OF THE PARENT WHO IS

190
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ACTUALLY LOST THEIR CHILDREN.

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HE SAID THEY ARE HOLDING UP AS

192
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WELL AS CAN POSSIBLY BE

193
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
EXPECTED, SHARING SOME OF THE

194
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
JOYFUL MEMORIES THEY HAD WITH

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IN THIS TIME WHEN THE PEOPLE

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
JOY, THE BIRTH OFE PREPARING

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
CHRIST AND CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WITH TWINKLING LIGHTS, I ASKED

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HIM, HOW DO PEOPLE COPE AT THIS

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
TIME, CHRISTMAS TIME.

202
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HE SAID THERE ARE 20 BRIGHTER

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
STARS IN HEAVEN.

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
JUST ONE THOUGHT OF WHAT THIS

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
COMMUNITY HAS LOST, 20 CHILDREN

206
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
GONE, PEOPLE JUST BEGINNING TO

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
COPE, JUST BEGINNING TO COME

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
TOGETHER.

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
TODAY, I SPENT SOME TIME ON THE

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
MAIN STREET.

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THIS IS A TINY THROW-BACK MAIN

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
STREET.

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
MOM-AND-POP SHOPS.
WE TALKED TO A WOMAN WHO CUTS

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
CHILDREN'S HAIR SPECIFICALLY, IN

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TOWN.

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SHE WAS WAITING TO HEAR HOW MANY

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
OF THE KIDS THAT SHE KNOWS WERE

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AMONG THE INJURED OR AMONG THE

219
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DEAD.
WE ALSO SPENT TIME IN THE

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
COMMUNITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

221
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WHERE THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
LIVED, WHERE SHE WAS MURDERED

223
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THIS MORNING.

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WHERE SHE WAS SHOT BEFORE HER

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SON, ADAM, TOOK HER FAMILY CAR

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
AND HEADED FOR THE SCHOOL.

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
BEAUTIFUL, BIG HOMES -- AN

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
ADORABLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

229
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
ABSOLUTELY FILLED WITH CHRISTMAS

230
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
LIGHTS.
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER

231
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
JOY-FILLED NEIGHBORHOOD IN THIS

232
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
TIME OF THE HOLIDAYS.

233
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
BUT INSTEAD, IT WAS MARKED OFF

234
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WITH YELLOW CRIME TAPE.

235
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WE COULD BARELY SEE AROUND THE

236
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
CORNER TO WHERE THE HOME WAS, TO

237
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WHERE THE S.W.A.T. TEAMS AND THE

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
AUTHORITIES THAT HAD BEEN THERE

239
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
EARLIER IN THE DAY INVESTIGATING

240
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
HAD SPENT THEIR TIME, HAD SPENT

241
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THEIR TIME EARLIER IN THE DAY.

242
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WE WERE THERE AT 3:00 IN THE

243
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
AFTERNOON, WHEN THE S.W.A.T.

244
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
TEAM MEMBER, WHEN THE

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
INVESTIGATORS STARTED TO CLEAR

246
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
OUT AND WE COULD SEE THE

247
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
MANPOWER THAT THEY INVESTED IN

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, EARLIER IN

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
THE DAY, WHEN THEY FINALLY FOUND

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
OUT WHERE TO GO TO BEGIN TO LOOK

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
FOR CLUES AS TO WHY HE WOULD

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS,
PLANNED SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

253
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
HOW THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED.

254
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THEY WERE THERE TO LOOK FOR ANY

255
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
CLUES AND ANY CONTINUING IT

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
DANGER.
THAT'S BEING SECURED TONIGHT.

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
STILL HAVE PEOPLE THERE, KEEPING

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
AN EYE ON THINGS IN THAT

259
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
COMMUNITY.
BUT AS YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND,

260
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
DEVASTATED NEIGHBORS, CONFUSED

261
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
NEIGHBORS IN THAT COMMUNITY,

262
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
CERTAINLY NOT USED TO SOMETHING

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
LIKE THIS, OCCURRING IN A

264
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE NEWTOWN.

265
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THIS IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

266
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MOVE INTENTIONALLY TO RAISE

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THEIR CHILDREN, FOR THE SCHOOL

268
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
SYSTEM, FOR THE ADORABLE

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THROW-BACK COMMUNITY, FOR THAT

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ESSENCE OF WHAT EVERYONE WANTS

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THEIR CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE

272
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THAT, TRUE SMALL-TOWN FEELING,

273
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WHERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

274
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PEOPLE WILL SHOW UP AT A

275
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
COMMUNITY CHURCH TO GRIEVE AND

276
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
JOIN TOGETHER AND TO WORK

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
TOWARDS REPAIR.

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000

AGO, POLICE ROLLED UP THEIR

296
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000

IT HAD BEEN BLOCKING THE

DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS, BUT

THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON.

323
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THEY HAVE BEEN ON EDGE.

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000

THE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN

344
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SPOTTY.

345

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> THANK YOU.

372
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> GRETA: WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
OF THOSE, IN COLUMBINE AND

374
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
BEFORE THAT.
YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GOING TO

375
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY, DO

376
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
YOU?
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

377
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THIS IS HORRIFIC.

378
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
IT'S TRAGIC, THE PARENTS SENT

379
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL TO BE

380
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
EDUCATED AND NEVER EXPECTED

381
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
NEVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

382
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
IT'S A HEART-BREAKING TRAGEDY

383
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS ENDURING.

384
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> GRETA: YOU THINK RIGHT NOW,

385
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
YOU HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED ALL THE

386
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
BODIES, HAVE YOU?

387
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
>> WE HAVE NOT.

388
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WE HAVE TENTATIVE

389
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
IDENTIFICATION.
WE HAVE TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY

390
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
EVERYONE.
WE CERTAINLY WANT TO DO THAT AS

391
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AS WE

392
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
SPEAK.
WE WILL WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT.

393
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILIES.

394
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> GRETA: JUST IMAGINE IF YOU

395
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
ARE FAMILY AT HOME AND YOU

396
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
EVAPORATE GOTTEN WORD, BUT YOUR

397
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
CHILD ISN'T HOME SO YOU KNOW

398
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THAT YOUR CHILD WAS ONE OF THE

399
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
VICTIMS.

400
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
IT'S INEVITABLE.

401
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
IMAGINE THAT PAIN?
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

402
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT NO ONE

403
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
REALLY EVER WANTS TO BEAR.

404
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO HAVE

405
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
TO -- HEAR THE PARENTS BEING

406
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TOLD THEIR CHILDREN WERE NOT

407
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
COMING HOME.

408
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
IT WAS HEARTBREAKING FOR THE LAW

409
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO GO IN TO

410
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
RESCUE AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY

411
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
DID, AS MANY STAFFERS AS THEY

412
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
DID AND THEN ENCOUNTER WHAT THEY

413
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
DISCOVERED IN THOSE LAST TWO

414
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
CLASSROOMS.

415
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> GRETA: WAS THE SITUATIONS
WHERE THE KILLER KILLED EVERYONE

416
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
IN ONE ROOM AND KILLED AN ENTIRE

417
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
CLASS?
>> NO.

418
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

419
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT.

420
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THERE

421
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
WERE DECEASED IN TWO CLASSROOMS

422
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
AND THE HALLWAY AND IT WAS A

423
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
HORRIFIC SCENE.
>> GRETA: WAS HE KNOWN TO LAW

424
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
ENFORCEMENT?
SOMETIMES THEIR NAMES ARE

425
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
FAMILIAR, THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND?

426
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT.

427
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
WE HAVE A COMMAND INVESTIGATION

428
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
UNDERWAY.
WE HAVE BROUGHT IN MAJOR CRIME

429
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
DETECTIVES AND HAD THE NEWTOWN

430
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
POLICE DETECTIVES WORKING WITH

431
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
US.
WE ARE GOING TO ANSWER THOSE

432
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
QUESTIONS AND DO AN EXTENSIVE

433
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
BACKGROUND ON THE SHOOTER AND

434
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
ANSWER EVERY QUESTION ABOUT THE

435
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
HISTORY AND HISTORICAL -- ANY

436
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT THIS

437
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
YOUNG MAN MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

438
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
IN.
WE WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED?

439
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
>> GRETA: HAD THE MOTHER EVER

440
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
COMPLAINED ABOUT HIM OR SAID

441
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
ANYTHING THAT SHE WAS WORRIED

442
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
ABOUT HIM?

443
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> THERE IS NOTHING THAT SHOWED

444
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

445
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OCCUR.
BUT, AGAIN, OUR INVESTIGATORS

446
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
WILL LOOK AT ALL OF THAT.

447
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
WE WILL INTERVIEW ALL THE

448
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL,

449
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SUPERINTENDENT, FRIENDS, FAMILY,

450
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
RELATIVES, CO-WORKERS.

451
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
THE LIST IS ENDLESS AND WE WILL

452
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

453
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>> GRETA: ONE THING THAT IS

454
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
CURIOUS IS THAT, THAT I HAVE

455
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
READ OR HEARD THAT THE MOTHER

456
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WAS FOUND DEAD AT HER HOME AND

457
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SHE IS ALSO A TEACHER.

458
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
SO WAS SHE NOT TEACHING NOW?

459
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
DID SHE CALL IN SICK?

460
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
WHY WASN'T SHE AT SCHOOL?

461
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
DO YOU KNOW?
>> WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED ANYONE

462
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
YE
SO I AM IN A POSITION WHERE,

463
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
KITELL YOU WE HAVE A SECONDARY

464
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
SCENE WITH A DECEASED FEMALE, WE

465
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
TENTATIVELY HAVE IDENTIFIED.

466
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE

467
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AND HAVE TO ANSWER.

468
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
AT THIS POINT IN TIME, WE

469
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
HAVEN'T ANSWERED THEM.

470
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> GRETA: WAS THERE A SUBSTITUTE

471
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
TEACHENER THAT CLASSROOM?

472
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
>> THAT, I DON'T KNOW.

473
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SORRY, I DON'T KNOW.

474
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> GRETA: RIGHT NOW, MEDICAL

475
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
EXAMINERS IN WITH THE CHILDREN
AND THE ADULTS?

476
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> YEAH, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

477
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
AT THE SCENE WITH A TEAM.

478
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
AND HE HAS HIS TEAM IN PLACE.

479
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
THEY ARE GOING TO WORK RIGHT

480
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND DO

481
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO TO

482
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN FOR THESE

483
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
FAMILIES.

484
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>> GRETA: YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I

485
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
HAVE COVERED THESE STORY, THE

486
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
POLICE OFFICER, LAW ENFORCEMENT,

487
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THEY ARE ALL PARENTS.

488
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
YOU KNOW, THEY GO INTO THESE

489
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SCENES AND IT'S LIKE -- IT'S

490
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
UNTHINKABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE.

491
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THEY ALL HAVE KIDS.

492
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THE ANAL OF THESE CHILDREN?

493
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> YEAH.

494
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SCENE FOR

495
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THEM.

496
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO

497
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
HAVE ENTERED THE BUILDING, WE

498
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH

499
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
COUNSELING.

500
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
WE DID THAT SAME FOR THE FAMILY.

501
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
WE BROUGHT IN CLERGY.

502
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
IT IS HARD.

503
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
IT'S VERY HARD FORWARD LAW

504
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ENFORCEMENT, THE FIRE SERVICE,

505
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
EMS PERSONNEL.

506
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BUT CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE THE

507
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PARENTS ARE GOING THROUGH.

508
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> NO PARENT WANTS TO SEND HIS

509
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
CHILD TO A SCHOOL THAT IS

510
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
ESSENTIALLY A PRISON WITH A LOT

511
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
OF METAL DETECTORS AND SECURITY

512
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

513
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
BUT I AM CURIOUS, THIS SCHOOL --

514
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ANY SECURITY -- NOT THAT I AM IN

515
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
ANY WAY CONDEMNING THEM IF IT

516
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HASN'T -- YOU KNOW, IT GOES BOTH

517
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
WAYS?

518
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE

519
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
SCHOOL WAS SECURE.

520
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
IT WAS VERY SECURE.

521
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
AND WE WILL CERTAINLY DETERMINE

522
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
EXACTLY HOW THE SHOOTER WAS ABLE

523
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
TO GAIN ACCESS.

524
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
>> GRETA: SECURE IN THE SENSE

525
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THAT IF I TRIED TO GET IN,

526
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
SOMEBODY WOULD STOP ME?

527
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
THAT KIND OF SECURE?

528
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
SOMEONE HAS TO LET ME IN?

529
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
YOU COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IN.

530
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
>> GRETA: THANK YOU.

531
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
AND GOOD LUCK.

532
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH ON YOU AND

533
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY,

534
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE DEAD.

535
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THANK YOU, SIR.

536
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
OUR LIVE COVERAGE FROM

537
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
CONNECTICUT CONTINUES IN JUST

538
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
ONE MINUTE.

539
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WE WILL HAVE THE LATEST

540
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
INFORMATION ON THE KILLER, PLUS

541
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
MORE ON THE LONG INVESTIGATION

542
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THAT IS AHEAD.

543
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
FORMER DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN

544
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
WILL BE HERE.

545
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
"ON THE RECORD" LIVE FROM

546
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
NEWTOWN, STAY WITH US.

547
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
FROM NEWTOWN, STAY WITH US.

548
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I JUST KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

549
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THERE AND IT IS IT GOING TO BE

550
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
OKAY AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE

551
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ALL RIGHT I PULL WOULD A BOOK

552
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SHELF AND WE WERE BARRICADED

553
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
AND DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

554
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000

THAT THERE WAS ONE GUNMAN, MAYBE

738
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
TWO.
WE HAVE TWO REPORTS THAT ONE

739
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
GUNMAN MAY BE DEAD.

740
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, THIS IS

741
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
A FAST-MOVING, VERY FLUID

742
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
SITUATION AT THE SCHOOL.

743
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ON A

744
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
DAY LIKE TODAY... TO VIEW THIS

745
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
AS I KNOW THE PRESIDENT AS A

746
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
FATHER DOES AND I AS A FATHER

747
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AND OTHERS WHO ARE PARENTS

748
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
CERTAINLY DO, WHICH IS TO.

749
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
FEEL ENORMOUS SYMPATHY FOR

750
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
FAMILIES THAT ARE AFFECTED AND

751
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

752
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
>> SOURCES ARE TELLING FOX NEWS

753
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
THAT 26 PEOPLE ARE DEAD AT THIS

754
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
TIME.

755
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
EIGHT ADULT, INCLUDING THE
SHOOTER AND 18 CHILDREN.

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
>> WHEN IT HAPPENED, I HEARD THE

757
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
GUNSHOTS AND SO -- THEY WERE

758
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
BOTH -- LIKE I SAID, IT WAS ONE

759
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
OF THOSE THING, WE ARE TRYING TO

760
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE TELL THEM, ULTIMATELY, IT'S

761
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
GOING TO BE MUCH WORSE.

762
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> ONE SOURCE SUGGESTING THE

763
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN A YOUNG

764
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
MAN, AS YOUNG AS 20 YEARS OLD.

765
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
HE MAY LIVE IN NEW JERSEY.

766
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THERE MAY BE A SEPARATE

767
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
SITUATION THERE, A CRIME SCENE,

768
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
WHERE THEY KICKED DOWN THE DOOR

769
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
OF THAT PERSON'S HOME.

770
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WE ARE TRYING TO CONFIRM THAT AT

771
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
THIS TIMEO AT THIS TIME.

772
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
WE DON'T BE THE IDENTITY OF THE

773
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
GUNMAN AND AT THIS POINT, HIS

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

775
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
>> THERE WERE SEVERAL FATALITIES

776
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
AT THE SCENE, BOTH STUDENTS AND

777
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
STAFF.
THERE IS NO INFORMATION,

778
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
RELATIVE TO THAT BEING RELEASED

779
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
AT THIS TIME, UNTIL WE HAVE MADE

780
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
COMPLETE AND PROPER

781
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
NOTIFICATION.
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

782
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
IT'S SHEER TERROR.

783
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
AND -- AND -- AND A SENSE OF

784
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
IMMEDIATE URGENCY AND... YOU

785
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
KNOW, TO GET TO YOUR CHILD --

786
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
AND TO BE THERE TO PROTECT THEM.

787
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SAID TO MAKE

788
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE SHOOTING

789
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
TODAY.

790
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.

791
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH

792
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

793
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
MULLER.
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

794
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

795
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR, HE

796
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WILL HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE

797
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
THAT HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
THIS HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

799
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

800
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, THRRN

801
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
FATALITIES, THERE WERE 18

802
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
CHILDREN THAT WERE PRONOUNCED

803
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
DEAD AT THE SCHOOL.

804
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE

805
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS,

806
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

807
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
HOSPITALS AND SIX ADULTS,

808
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE, AT

809
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THE SCHOOL.

810
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
>> REMEMBER THAT THIS HAPPENED

811
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
JUST OVER SIX HOURS AGO.

812
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
SO THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE

813
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
STILL BEING PROCESSED, THE CRIME

814
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
SCENE STILL VERY ACTIVE AND

815
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
OTHER SCENES NOW BEING

816
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
INVESTIGATED, INCLUDING

817
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
APPARENTLY, THE HOME OF THE

818
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER HERE IN

819
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
NEWTOWN, WHERE AN ADULT BODY WAS

820
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
FOUND, AS WELL AS ANOTHER

821
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
RESIDENT IN NEW JERSEY.

822
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS

823
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE

824
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
SHOOTER'S FATHER AND CONFLICTING

825
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
REPORTS ON THE SHOOTER HIMSELF.

826
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

827
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

828
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

829
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

830
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

831
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

832
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
BIRTH DAYS, GRADUATIONS,

833
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
WEDDINGS...:  KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

834
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
[SIGHING].
>> AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

835
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

836
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

837
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

838
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

839
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
TODAY... FOR THE PARENTS AND

840
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

841
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

842
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

843
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

844
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
>> GRETA: SHEER TERROR, YOUNG

845
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
CHILDREN, PARENTS AND TEACHERS,

846
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
ALL WITNESSING THE TRAGEDY, THIS

847
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
HORRIBLE VIOLENCE.

848
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
>> DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL T.

849
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

850
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

851
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORD, IT'S SHEER

852
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
TERROR AND -- AND -- A TEPEES OF

853
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
IMMEDIATE URGENCY AND...:  YOU

854
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
KNOW, TO GET TO YOUR CHILD AND

855
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
TO BE THERE TO PROTECT THEM.

856
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> I GOT AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL

857
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SHOOTING,

858
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY WHERE AND

859
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
THE SCHOOLS WERE ON LOCKDOWN.

860
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
SO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT, I GOT

861
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
A TEXT FROM MACHINE WHO SAID

862
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
THERE WAS A SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL

863
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
ON SANDY HOOK -- AND I SAID, OH,

864
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
MY GOD, THAT'S DAN.

865
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I WENT TO THE SCHOOL, THERE WERE

866
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SOME OF THE SM HISTORICAL MOMS

867
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THAT I KNEW AND I SAID, WHAT'S

868
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
GOING ON?

869
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
SHE SAID THE PRINCIPAL IS DEAD

870
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
AND CHILDREN CAME OUT WITH

871
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
BLOOD.
>> WE -- WE ARE COPING.

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S

873
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
GOING ON.

874
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
IT'S A LITTLE NERVE RACKING.

875
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
AS YOU CAN TELL, BEHIND US, WE

876
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DO HAVE A FEW MORE CARS PULLING

877
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
IN.

878
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
HOW MANY SHOOTERS?
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INJURED?

879
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
>> SHE WAS IN A SMALL CLASS, A

880
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
READING GROUP AND THEY STARTED

881
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
HEARING, I GUESS, BANGS AND...

882
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
AND GOT HER TEACHER, WHICH I AM

883
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
SO GRATEFUL FOR, THERE WAS A

884
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
SMALL GROUP, THEY RUSHED THE

885
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
KIDS INTO THE BATHROOM AND THEY

886
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
LOCKED THE DOOR AND THEY JUST

887
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TOLD THE CHILDREN THAT IT WAS

888
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
HAMMERING AND TRIED TO KEEP THEM

889
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
CALM.

890
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW -- BECAUSE

891
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET A COMPLETE

892
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
STORY.
THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS THAT

893
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THE POLICE CAME AND THEY WERE

894
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TO BE LET

895
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
OUT -- OF THE CLASSROOM.

896
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
AND WHEN THEY WERE, SHE HAD SEEN

897
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
GLASS AND BLOOD -- ONE CHILD WAS

898
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
COVERED IN BLOOD, BUT I

899
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS SAFE.

900
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
>> LATER ON, AGAIN, SHE WAS

901
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
TALKING ABOUT HOW -- THE -- YOU

902
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
KNOW, WHILE SHE WAS WALKING DOWN

903
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
THE HALLWAY, THE POLICE TOLD

904
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES

905
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A

906
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
VERY SENSITIVE SCENE.

907
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AND SHE SAID SHE HEARD GUNSHOTS

908
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
AND -- ACTUALLY, WHAT SHE TOLD

909
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ME WAS -- IN THE BEGINNING, THE

910
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
INTERCOM CAME OUT AND SHE HEARD

911
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
A SCREAM ON THE INTERCOM, AROUND

912
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
THE SCHOOL.

913
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
AND THE INTERCOM WENT

914
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
IMMEDIATELY OFF.

915
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I AM NOT SURE HOW IS HOW THE

916
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SCHOOL GOT LOCKDOWN AND SHE DID

917
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
HEAR A SCREAM ON THE INTERCOM.

918
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> NOTHING MAKES SENSE LIKE

919
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THIS, IT'S SENSELESS.

920

956
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER INSIDE OF

THAT CLASSROOM, AND BODIES

958
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
STILL IN THE CLASSROOM AND

959
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
TRYING TO DETERMINE IDEPTITY.

960
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW

961
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE POLICE

962
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FAMILIES AND EVERYTHING.

964
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THIS HAS TO BE DONE, DOESN'T

965
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
IT?

966
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> IT DOES HAVE TO BE DONE,

967
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
GRETA AND UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN

968
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
IMAGINE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND

969
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
YOU TRY TO PUT THAT OUT OF

970
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
YOUR MIND.

971
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER AND

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
FORENSIC PERSONNEL HAVE TO

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BLUE PRIPT THE ROOM WHERE EACH

974
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
AND EVERY PERSON IS.

975
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
ALL EVIDENCE HAS TO BE

976
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
PHOTOGRAPHED BEFORE IT IS

977
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
DISTURBED AND YOU HAVE TO

978
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
NUMBER AND THE POSITIONS OF

979
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
EACH BODY.

980
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
EACH BODY HAS TO BE PROCESSED

981
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND EXAMINED BY THE CORONER

982
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
AND FORENSICALLY AND

983
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DOCUMENTED AND EVIDENCE

984
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
COLLECTED AND THEN, AND ONLY

985
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THEN CAN YOU REMOVE EACH BODY

986
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
ONE AT A TIME.

987
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK OF THE

988
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
FAMILIES TONIGHT.

989
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THEY HAVEN'T GOT KNOW OFFICIAL

990
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
WORD THEIR CHILD IS DEAD OR A

991
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
LOVED ONE OR WIFE OR MOTHER.

992
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
BUT IF YOU ARE SITTING AT HOME

993
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AND YOU ARE EXPECTING YOUR

994
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
CHILD TO BE HOME OR EXPECTED

995
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
YOUR WIFE OR MOTHER OR FATHER

996
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
TO BE HOME AND THAT PERSON

997
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HASN'T SHOWN UP.

998
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT YOU

999
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
ARE -- YOUR FAMILY MEMBER WAS

1000
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
A VICTIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

1001
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ARE THINKING WHY IN THE WORLD

1002
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
GOING ON.
WE KNOW WHO THE SHOOTER IS.

1003
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
HE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD

1004
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
AND THERE IS IT A RISK OF A

1005
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
CO-DEFENDANT OR SOMEONE WHO

1006
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
HELPED HIM AND YOU WILL HAVE

1007
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
TO PUT A CASE TOGETHER; IS

1008
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THAT WHY THEY DO THIS?

1009
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
>> YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT IT,

1010
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
BECAUSE IT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO

1011
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
DO TO REALLY CREATE A HISTORY

1012
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
OF THE INSTENT.

1013
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
FOR LEGAL PURPOSES AND

1014
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE CIVIL

1015
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
ACTIONS IF THERE IS NOT

1016
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
CRIMINAL.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

1017
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SUSPECT WAS DESCRIBED AS

1018
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE MENTAL

1019
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
PROBLEMS AND INCAPACITY AS FAR

1020
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
AS HIS MENTAL STATE HE

1021
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
HAVE BEEN FORMULATED BY

1022
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
SOMEONE ELSE AND GUIDED AND

1023
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION AND

1024
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
A CONSPIRACY, YOU KNOW.

1025
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
IT IS REALLY WHAT I AM TALKING

1026
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ABOUT AND SOMEBODY COULD HAVE

1027
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PUT HIM UP AND GAVE HIM

1028
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
INFORMATION AND COMPLETED THE

1029
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
CONSPIRACY.
AND THEN YOU WOULD NEED TO

1030
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
PROSECUTE THAT INDIVIDUAL.

1031
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SO IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE

1032
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THIS EARLY IN THE

1033
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
INVESTIGATION, YOU COUNTY

1034
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
DON'T KNOW -- WHAT YOU HAVE

1035
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
EXCEPT FOR THE VICTIMS.

1036
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
>> WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT

1037
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
OF AN IDEA WHO HE WAS.

1038
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES AND

1039
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000

ACWARD HE HIGH SCHOOL.

1041
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
AND FEW FREPPEDS AND HE DIDN'T

1042
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
CENTER A BOOK BOOK -- FACE

1043
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
BOOK PAGE WE ARE GETTING A

1044
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
GLIMPSE OF HIM TONIGHT .

1045
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
BUT THE DETECTIVES.

1046
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THEY HAVE TO DIG DEEPER, ARE

1047
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THEY NOT?

1048
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> THEY ARE GOING TO DIG

1049
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
DEEPER FOR WEEKS AND MAYBE

1050
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
LONGER THAN THAT.

1051
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THEY WILL DO AN AUTOPSY ON HIS

1052
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
MIND AND HIS LIFE AS WELL AS

1053
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
HIS BODY.
THEY ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT

1054
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WHO HE WAS TALKING TO AND WHAT

1055
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
HIGH WAS SAYING AND TALK TO

1056
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ANYBODY

1057
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
ON THE COMPUTER AND WEB SITES

1058
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
AND ANYTHING HE PUT OUT OR

1059
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
WROTE.

1060
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ANYTHING THAT HE THREATENED.

1061
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THEY ARE GOING TO FIND OUT

1062
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
JUST EXACTLY HOW MANY FLAGS

1063
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THERE WERE AND THAT IS REALLY

1064
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ONLY WAY TO GO BACK WARDS AND

1065
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
TRY TO PREVENT AN INCIDENT IS

1066
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
TO CONTROL THE INDIVIDUAL WITH

1067
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THE IDEA AND MOTIVATION TO DO

1068
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
AS HEINOUS AS THIS.

1069
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
NDO YOU EVER GET USED TO THE

1070
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
INVESTIGATION .

1071
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
20 CHILDREN.

1072
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THEY ARE LIKE FIVE OR 10 YEARS

1073
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
OLD.

1074
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WORST OF THE

1075
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
WORST.

1076
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
AND AS A DETECTIVE, DO YOU

1077
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
EVER, CAN YOU DO THIS?

1078
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
AND HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH

1079
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
THYSELF THINGS?

1080
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO

1081
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WAY THAT ANYBODY CAN PREPARE

1082
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
THEMSELVES FOR A CHILD'S

1083
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
HOMICIDE.
JUST IN THE SINGULAR SENSE.

1084
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
AGE IS BEYOND OVERWHELMING.

1087

SEEING THE SCENE WILL BE QUITE

1096
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THE SAME.
