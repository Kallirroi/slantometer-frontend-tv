After living for a time in Melbourne, Florida, Paddock moved to Nevada in 2016, his brother, Eric Paddock, said.  Stephen Paddock lived in Mesquite, Nevada, with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, police said. She was out of the country during the shooting, and is not believed to have been involved, police said.  Eric Paddock told CNN about Stephen: \"He was my brother and it's like an asteroid fell out of the sky.\" He said the last time he spoke to his brother was when Stephen texted, asking how their mother was after she lost power when Hurricane Irma hit Florida.  Eric Paddock said his brother had never shown violent tendencies, and had no affiliations with any terror or hate group. Paddock says he's still in the dark on why his brother would do this.   Stephen Paddock's father was a convicted bank robber who was on the FBI's most wanted list, from June 10, 1969, until May 5, 1977, the FBI said. Eric Paddock said his father, who was arrested in Oregon in 1978, died a few years ago."
